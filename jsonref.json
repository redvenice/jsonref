We were speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem?

And when the request to use the atomisers was raised, the response was, well, a little sniffy.The source said: \u0027Apparently Meghan didn\u0027t like the smell of the chapel, which, as you would expect, is a little musty. It\u0027s not unpleasant at all, though. \u0027It just smells how you would expect an old building to smell.

But more because the brothers have seemed so close throughout their lives. Until now, that is.    It now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles awayWith the stream of disclosures threatening to become a torrent, The Mail on Sunday understands courtiers at Kensington Palace have started a ‘mole hunt’ in an attempt to stop leaks to the media that have led to so many unfavourable reports.They have certainly not made for comfortable reading. Insiders have claimed, for example, that a rather ‘dictatorial’ Harry has been throwing his weight around, aggrieved that neither his brother nor courtiers and servants have been ‘rolling out the red carpet’ for his new American bride.It has been suggested that Meghan has been brusque with servants and that her exacting wedding preparations led Kate to burst into tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. It has been a stressful time all round, it is true. Kate has only recently given birth to her third child, Louis, while Meghan finds herself a newcomer in a foreign land – and a member of the most extraordinary family in Britain. Perhaps a few early false steps and antagonisms were to be expected.Kid Rock gets booted from his grand marshal gig at Nashville...Carole Middleton says she has stopped reading stories about...Kicking up a stink: \u0027Dictatorial\u0027 bride Meghan wanted air...Furious Duchess of Cambridge \u0027fell out with Meghan Markle...Share this articleMeghan, who has worked hard to master her new Royal brief, is well-liked not just by the public, but by her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. He admires her work ethic and shares an interest in the arts.But the MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested.As early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family. And it was in response that Charles attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham. He hoped it might bring the couples together.It didn’t go well. Indeed, one well-placed source says the occasion was marred by a ‘ghastly row’ between the couples – one reason there will be no repeat this Christmas. A senior Royal aide has revealed that the atmosphere at Anmer soured shortly after Harry and his then fiancee had arrived, and Meghan was judged to have been ‘downright rude’.          The MoS understands that as early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”.‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’Kate, it is said, already felt put upon in being asked to host Meghan and Harry. Tired and pregnant, she had been hoping for a quiet Christmas. Perhaps the strain showed.At any rate, the atmosphere was ‘poisonous’ for a while, continues the aide, and only thawed with a visit by Charles, who was told by William what had happened and did his best to jolly everyone along.This is by no means an isolated example of Meghan’s supposed high-handedness, according to chatter in Royal circles.A new book by Royal commentator Robert Jobson even claimed Harry had previously told one staff member: \u0027What Meghan wants, she gets.\u0027The MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested (pictured: Meghan and Kate at the wedding of Princess Eugenie)This newspaper has learned from one of William’s closest friends that the Prince had doubts about how suitable Meghan might be as his brother’s bride – and that he voiced them.It is understood William’s concerns reached the ears of the Queen and, more pertinently, of Harry himself. One member of William’s circle told the MoS: ‘The problem is that the Cambridges felt things had moved very quickly between Harry and Meghan. Wills particularly was worried and felt close enough to Harry to voice his thoughts.’The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brother. But few of us like it when our romantic choice is questioned – and this appears to be the case with Harry now.Royal observers are asking, too, if William fears that Meghan is in some way assuming the space occupied by his late mother Diana. A beautiful, fashion-loving Royal determined to make her mark through charitable works? The parallels are inevitable.          The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brotherKate, in contrast, has taken a less showy approach to her role. She has dutifully accepted advice on how to dress and how to deport herself as a Royal, whereas Meghan has so far seemed determined to strike out on her own – on occasion at least.It is understood that Kate has had a number of meetings over tea in which she has attempted to explain the rules of The Firm to Meghan – and that her advice didn’t go down well. Kate is said to have told friends she was very sad about what was happening and felt that Harry was ‘changing’.‘She and Harry have always had a very close relationship, but she said things were different,’ says one. But if William’s wife has become adept at fading into the background, that does not make her soft.On the contrary. ‘Meghan’s a strong character and so is Kate, so it doesn’t surprise me there have been clashes,’ said the source.Indeed, some are calling her a Steel Marshmallow, a phrase first applied to William and Harry’s great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother.With the days that William, Kate and Harry went around together as a dynamic team now decisively over, they are leading lives that are not only increasingly separate, but very different.Harry and Meghan spent a considerable part of the summer in their rented house in Oxfordshire where they entertained friends including George and Amal Clooney, and tennis star Serena Williams. Theirs is a markedly more celebrity-driven ‘court’ than has been normal for the Royals in recent times, and quite different from the so-called Turnip Toffs who make up William and Kate’s group of friends in Norfolk.And with the celebrity associates, it seems, come celebrity anxieties.So uncomfortable have they grown with a steady stream of media disclosures, it seems that Harry and Meghan are now determined to bring them to a halt.It will be fascinating to see just what or who the Royal ‘mole-hunt’ unearths."},{"url":null,"title":"Simon Cowell talks ITV hold Brexit debate no politicians","story":"Simon Cowell is in talks with ITV to hold a Brexit debate without any politiciansSimon Cowell is in talks with ITV to hold a Brexit debate featuring business leaders and 500 members of the public – but no politicians.A source close to Cowell’s TV production company Syco Entertainment said the audience would be representative of the result of the 2016 referendum.‘Simon wants to see how many change their stance during the debate,’ the insider said.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed in principle to go head-to-head on television next Sunday, but the Prime Minister wants the debate to be aired on the BBC while the Labour leader favours rival ITV.Meanwhile, Cowell, pictured left, has also revealed plans for a celebrity version of The X Factor – similar to the format of the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing – in an effort to revive flagging ratings.

It is due to be published this week in several languages. An advance copy of the Italian version was made available to Reuters.\u0027The question of homosexuality is a very serious one,\u0027 he said, adding that those entrusted with training men to be priests must be certain that candidates are \u0027humanly and emotionally mature\u0027 before they can be ordained.This also applied to women who wanted to enter female religious communities to become nuns. In the Catholic Church, priests, nuns and monks all take vows of celibacy.The Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful in themselves, but homosexual acts are.

Less than two weeks later, on August 26, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the Vatican\u0027s former ambassador to the Vatican, threw the Church into turmoil with a bombshell statement against the pope and Vatican officials.Vigano said a \u0027homosexual network\u0027 existed in the Vatican, whose members helped promote each other\u0027s careers in the Church.          The Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful in themselves, but homosexual acts areHe also accused the pope of having ignored alleged sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians by former American cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88.The Vatican said Vigano\u0027s accusations were riddled with \u0027calumny and defamation\u0027.The Catholic Church has been haunted for more than two decades by evidence of thousands of cases of sexual abuse of minors by clergy around the world, in countries ranging from the United States to Australia, Ireland, Belgium, Germany and Chile.In July, McCarrick became the first cardinal to resign in nearly 100 years after U.S. Church officials said allegations made in a separate investigation that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated.McCarrick has said he had no recollection of the alleged abuse of the minor, but has not commented on the allegations of misconduct with the seminarians, which allegedly took place decades ago."},{"url":null,"title":"Indian father 12lb tumour removed face jaw rebuilt leg bone","story":"    Majeed N, 45 underwent a 12-hour surgery to remove the 12lb tumour from his faceFor the past decade Majid has barely left his house in the city of Palakkad because he was ashamed of his facial deformity.The tumour, known as a chondroblastic osteosarcoma and measuring 8ins by 6ins, also made it difficult for Majeed to swallow and speak.He said: \u0027Due to the huge deformity on my face, my whole life had collapsed.\u0027I\u0027m so sorry Mom, I did drugs... in the surgery\u0027:...Two-Headed Mexican, Camel Girl and Beautiful Half-Woman:...Share this article\u0027I began staying indoors as people made fun of me.\u0027It is a huge relief to get the tumour off my face - it is almost like a second birth.\u0027The complicated surgery was carried out by 12 surgeons at Amrita Hospital in Kochi, India, over the course of a number of hours.

Michelle Doyle Wildman, acting chief executive of Parentkind, said: \u0027The vast majority of parents are doing a terrific job. I\u0027m not sure berating them will lead to positive change for our kids.\u0027Speaking before presenting Ofsted\u0027s annual report tomorrow, Miss Spielman said health professionals, parents and safeguarding partners should all play a role in raising children. She believes expectations on schools to address obesity, gang-related violence and knife crime risk distracting them from their core purpose.                        More than half of the schools have committed to lowering the mark required to pass the entrance test for pupils eligible for the \u0027pupil premium\u0027 – the Government measure of deprivation. Some agreed to lower the mark by up to ten points.One school pledged to admit all disadvantaged pupils living nearby even if their mark is lower than others – as long as they meet a minimum standard.Many also agreed to help \u0027pupil premium\u0027 children or those at schools in less affluent areas to prepare for entrance tests.It is understood that when the classrooms are built, the DfE will expect each school to set targets for the proportion of disadvantaged pupils they admit.Today\u0027s announcement builds on the 825,000 new school places created since 2010 and the million the Government is on course to create by 2020.Jim Skinner, of the Grammar School Heads Association, said: \u0027The large majority of selective schools prioritise access for disadvantaged pupils, which is backed up by outreach and partnership work with local schools.\u0027Selective schools are therefore well placed to contribute to meeting the ongoing need for more school places and supporting high-quality education provision elsewhere.\u0027The move comes after Theresa May was forced to scrap her plans to create a raft of new grammar schools, targeted at disadvantaged communities.The plan had to be abandoned when she lost her Commons majority because it would have required a change in the law.Following a ban by New Labour in 1998, the creation of new selective schools is illegal. Critics of grammars say only middle-class children can get in because so many parents pay for private tutoring to ensure high marks in entrance exams.But the Prime Minister believes the schools can be a force for social mobility if they adopt admissions procedures which favour poorer pupils."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/03/10/060590E1000005DC-6453031-image-m-4_1543833822034.jpg","title":"Baby Ps monster mother Tracey Connelly allowed contact surviving children","story":"    Tracey Connelly, pictured in 2013 when she was free on licence after being jailed for her role in the death of her son, has been allowed to write to her other childrenThe mother of tortured baby Peter Connelly  has been allowed to write to her surviving children from prison.Disgraced mother Tracey Connelly watched porn in a drunken haze as her 17-month-old son Peter, known as Baby P, was tortured to death in 2007 by her lover Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen.But despite her sickening lack of care for her son, she has been granted permission to write two letters a year to her other children to \u0027build bridges\u0027 before she hopes to win parole.  Court advisory service CAFCASS is overseeing the contact, with mediators checking the letters before they are sent to the children, reported The Sun.A source told the newspaper: \u0027She watched her own child starve and be brutally attacked, yet now she\u0027s being given another chance to be a mother.\u0027She\u0027s been given a chance to contact her other children.

W. Bush was placed into a hearse at the George H. Lewis Funeral Home following a family service,Monday\u0027Bush is a great man, just an all-around nice person,\u0027 an agent said of the former president when he was alive. \u0027Both he and Mrs. Bush are very thoughtful, and they think outside their own little world. They think of other people.\u0027\u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says. \u0027He can be friends with a lot of people who may not agree with him. The only things that bothered him were things that were important to the country. Little things just kind of seemed to roll off of him.\u0027When Bush—code-named Timberwolf—was vice president, agent William Albracht was on the midnight shift at the vice president\u0027s residence. While agents refer to the President\u0027s Protective Detail as the Show, they call the Vice President\u0027s Protective Detail the Little Show with Free Parking. That\u0027s because, unlike the White House, the vice president\u0027s residence provides parking for agents.Albracht was new to the post, and Agent Dowling filled him in.\u0027Well, Bill, every day the stewards bake the cookies, and that is their job, and that is their responsibility,\u0027 Dowling told him. \u0027And then our responsibility on midnights is to find those cookies or those left from the previous day and eat as many of them as possible.\u0027Assigned to the basement post around 3 a.m., Albracht was getting hungry.\u0027We never had permission to take food from the kitchen, but sometimes you get very hungry on midnights,\u0027 said Albracht.  \u0027I walked into the kitchen that was located in the basement and opened up the refrigerator. I\u0027m hoping that there are some leftover snacks from that day\u0027s reception, It was slim pickin\u0027s. All of a sudden, there\u0027s a voice over my shoulder.\u0027  George W. Bush playfully steps upon his father 27 January 1990 while he warms up for a run at Fort McNaire Army base while his mother Barbara  and Secret Service agents look on.  \u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says          President George H.W. Bush was assisted by Secret Service as he leaves the ballpark after watching the Houston Astros play the Chicago Cubs at Minute Maid Park in 2011\u0027Hey, anything good in there to eat?\u0027 the man asked.\u0027No, looks like they cleaned it out,\u0027 Albracht said.\u0027I turned around to see George Bush off my right shoulder,\u0027 Albracht said. \u0027After I get over the shock of who it was, Bush says, Hey, I was really hoping there would be something to eat. And I said, Well, sir, every day the stewards bake cookies, but every night they hide them from us.\u0027With a wink of his eye he says, Let\u0027s find \u0027em. So we tore the kitchen apart, and sure enough we did find them. He took a stack of chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk and went back up to bed, and I took a stack and a glass of milk and went back to the basement post.\u0027When Albracht returned to the post, Dowling asked, \u0027Who the hell were you in there talking to?\u0027Albracht told him what had happened. \u0027Oh yeah, sure right,\u0027 Dowling said.Agents noted the contrast between George H. W. Bush and Al Gore, one of Bush\u0027s successors as vice president. Like Hillary Clinton, Gore - who also claimed to be a champion of the \u0027little people\u0027-treated agents with disdain and told them he did not want to be bothered greeting them or seeing them.\u0027Gore told agents at his home in Carthage, Tennessee, that they should duck behind bushes when they rotated shifts because the Gores didn\u0027t want to see them,\u0027 a former agent says. \u0027I was on the detail one Christmas when Gore was at his home in Carthage,\u0027 former agent Jeff Crane says. \u0027Neighbors offered us food on Christmas Day, but the Gores never even bothered to say \u0027Merry Christmas\u0027 or \u0027Thank you.\u0027Hillary Clinton, who continues to be protected by the Secret Service as the spouse of a former president, is so nasty to her agents that being assigned to her detail is considered by agents to be a form of punishment and the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service.Like Bush, President Trump treats his agents with respect and consideration. Sitting on a sofa overlooking the main Mar-a-Lago pool four days before a recent New Year\u0027s Eve party there, I asked Trump how he likes being protected by Secret Service agents.          Hillary Clinton, who continues to be protected by the Secret Service as the spouse of a former president, is so nasty to her agents that being assigned to her detail is considered by agents to be a form of punishment and the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service  Surrounded by Secret Service agents, President George Bush waves to the crowd from his limousine after attending a ceremony honoring World War II dead in Rome\u0027It\u0027s great,\u0027 he said. \u0027I have agents all around me as I\u0027m playing golf, and they are all looking in different directions, so when I miss a shot, they don\u0027t see it!\u0027When he was vice president, Bush flew to a fund-raiser in Boise, Idaho, during the 1982 election campaign. He was to have dinner at the Chart House seafood restaurant on North Garden Street, on the banks of the Boise River.\u0027The way we protected him, we had some agents inside, but typically what we\u0027d do was situate ourselves at dining tables near him,\u0027 Dowling says.Dowling had been seated for a few minutes when he heard a radio transmission: Two white males in camouflage outfits and carrying long weapons were creeping around the back toward their location. They were crawling on their bellies, moving themselves along with their elbows.Just then, Dowling looked up and saw the two bad guys. He thought of intelligence reports that Libya had sent a hit squad to the U.S. to kill American officials. The agent instinctively jumped out of his chair and tackled Bush to protect him. Food flew everywhere as Dowling threw the vice president on the ground and flopped on top of him.\u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027 Bush demanded to know.\u0027I don\u0027t know, but just keep your head down,\u0027 Dowling answered.Dowling looked up. He saw dozens of law enforcement officers with their guns drawn—Secret Service agents, sheriff\u0027s department deputies, and state troopers.

Which should not be there. It doesn\u0027t touch on how this little girl died.\u0027What is on the record and will be kept on the record, and people tend to go to, is the inquisition, is the very end document where the findings are, and that\u0027s incorrect.\u0027          Poppi was found lifeless and bleeding in her father\u0027s double bed in December 2012Pictured: Poppi Worthington\u0027s neighbour who was arrested...Share this articleHe added: \u0027It is perfectly clear this was an asphyxia death.

Anne Boleyn, portrayed by Natalie Dormer in the Showtime series The Tudors, was executed by her husband Henry VIII in 1536, after their marriage sparked the English Refomration  Over the course of their tumultuous marriage, Anne gave birth to a daughter who would go on to become Queen Elizabeth I, but failed to produce a male heir.In 1536, Henry ordered Anne to be executed by decapitation after trying her for adultery and incest.Samantha, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and is wheelchair-bound, has been feuding with Meghan since before the wedding, most often about her estrangement from their ailing 74-year-old father, Thomas Markle. Meghan, 34, and Harry, 37, are set to welcome their first child together sometime between April and May, which is when Samantha is planning to release her book, titled In The Shadows of The Duches, which, in the author\u0027s words, promises to uncover all of her sister\u0027s \u0027lies\u0027 and shed light on the rift in their family.In a tweet on Saturday, Samantha accused her sister of \u0027ghosting\u0027 their entire family.Samantha\u0027s barbed comments directed at Meghan come amid a litany of reports suggesting that the newly minted duchess and her royal husband have had a falling-out with Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge.           Samantha has accused Meghan of ghosting her father Thomas and their side of the familyIt was also suggested that the mom-to-be duchess was overly demanding with staff, and that her personal assistant quit after being reduced to tears. Last month, it was announced that Harry and Meghan were moving out of Kensington Palace, where William and Kate reside with their three children, and relocating to Windsor. Despite a steady drumbeat of stories painting a picture of a strained relationship between the two royal couples, last week it emerged that William, Harry and their wives will join the Queen and other members of the royal family at Sandringham for Christmas, in an apparent show of unity.  "},{"url":null,"title":"WH Talks China significant progress 90 days trade truce called off","story":"    The president\u0027s top economic adviser indicated on Monday that the trade truce with China would be called off if an agreement doesn\u0027t begin to \u0027firm up\u0027 by a mutually agreed upon deadline of April 1           \u0027At the end of 90 days, they have to show significant process,\u0027 Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, reaffirmed.Talks with China have fallen apart at other junctures, including a round of talks led by Mnuchin earlier this year.

They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. We make the finest and cleanest product in the World, and that is what China wants.

It features a portrait of the Zimbabwean politician Joshua Nkomo, looking “fat and dishevelled”. She has no particular beef with that, as she explains to a group of journalists, many of whom were not yet born when the picture appeared – “he was the enemy at that point”. But shockingly, it was the only picture of a non-white person that she found in the paper that year.It was not for want of searching: she was working on her MA at the time and part of her mission was to investigate what young black artists like herself were looking at. In 2007 – the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the British empire – she began to take a more systematic approach, cutting out every image of a black person she could find in the paper over a period of years. Some she painted over, emphasising patterns and “restoring the dignity” of their subjects, in an extended critique which would culminate last year in the show that won her the Turner prize.Today’s  is very different to that of the early 1980s, with the sports pages in particular brimming with triumphant black athletes. Is she happier now? Is she hell – though she concedes that the problem has changed over the years, from absence to varieties of presence. On the morning after her Turner win, she laid into “this extraordinary habit of placing negative text, about something else entirely, next to images of black people … juxtapositions that are always to do with either violence, prisons or theft.”To many of the people working with those texts and images, her reading seemed baffling. So we invited her in to the  for a three-day residency that would bring her face to face with the staff responsible for producing a newspaper which, she emphasises, is not merely her favourite but the only one she cares about. The resulting artwork – based on 15 pages published during the week of her residency – has just gone on show at Liverpool Central Library.If Himid’s mission was to find out how the print edition came out looking as it did, the ’s was to investigate how her opinions, as a newspaper traditionalist, might change when confronted with the realities of a global news operation reporting 24 hours a day on stories from all over the world, only a fraction of which make it into her beloved paper.It didn’t begin well. Himid reported for her first day clutching a copy of the previous Saturday’s Weekend magazine and fulminating: “I can’t believe you gave me this. Now of all times.” The problem was a front-page picture illustrating an issue themed around “the impossible body”. It featured a black male dancer contorted into a shape so extreme that he appears, literally, to have lost his head. Pictures that involve the cropping of faces turn out to be one of her pet hates: another was of Tiger Woods disembarking from a jet in Paris for September’s Ryder Cup, his head clipped into a flat-top at the upper edge of the frame.Other stories to emerge from her “random selection from a random week” included the sentencing of the American entertainer Bill Cosby for aggravated sexual assault, and the latest episode in the soap opera of Manchester United footballer Paul Pogba. “He’s just a young man. He hasn’t raped and abused like Cosby, so why have you got the word ‘punished’ on the back page?”.The coincidence of Cosby and Pogba bookending a single edition of the paper – one on the front page and one on the back – highlighted her central question: were such collisions the result of accident or design? It took the combined insistence of the news and sports desks to convince her that this particular combination was the product of separate departments working to their own time pressures in different parts of the office.One of the revelations for Himid was how big the  is. “I had this image of you sitting in a room with your big braces and your cigars and your whiskies just putting the whole thing together, but actually it’s more like a call centre,” she said. She was also surprised – “though I shouldn’t be” – by the pace at which it is created. “What I hadn’t got my head around was that you were producing it faster than I was reading it,” she said. “Sometimes I read Saturday’s paper on Wednesday, so I’m working at a different pace to you. As journalists, you are on to the next thing, but as a reader I am not.”Living in Preston, in the north of England, she was also unfamiliar with edition changes which, over the course of a night, can transform a snatched news picture into something more considered. The CosbyPogba paper was a case in point: the first edition – which goes to press at 9pm UK time – featured on the front page a snap of Cosby being led away in handcuffs, while the back page showed Pogba and his teammates killing time on the bench before a big match. The final, more polished edition, sent to press at 1am, replaced those with a police mugshot of Cosby and an action shot from the match, which by then had taken place.The earlier images, she says, seemed “stolen” – another of her bugbears, in that snatched pictures take the power away from their subjects. That’s because they were indeed snatched, conceded the ’s head of photography, Fiona Shields, who pointed out that placeholder pictures were often necessary for early takes on late-breaking stories. In the case of Cosby, as with all American stories, the challenge was exacerbated by the time difference between the US and the UK.So what of that “impossible body” photograph from Weekend magazine, which carried the cover line: “How we control, improve and future-proof what nature gave us”? The supplement’s editor, Melissa Denes, explained that the intention had been to cast a performer who could do something extraordinary – “visually almost impossible” – with their body, working with Royal Opera House ballet dancer Jordan Ajadi. “A cover of a sexualised white woman might have been the more common approach for an issue on the body, but the magazine also aims to cast people of colour wherever possible.”Questions of power and control recurred on the sports pages, with head of sport Will Woodward making a strong case for the picture of the jetsetting Woods. “This is the story of a sportsman who has made a triumphant comeback from the apparent collapse of his career,” he said. “I think it makes him look very cool.” Himid’s artistic response, in her overpainted version, was to restore the golfer’s head to its natural shape.In her debrief with  staff at the end of the project it was pointed out that there was an irony in so much criticism being centred on a section which features such a high proportion of successful black sportspeople. It was the section in which image and word most often collided, with “Europe can tame Tiger” among the headlines she singled out as problematic, because of its animal imagery (she has previously objected to the use of “Venomous Venus”).The sports team pointed out that alliteration was one of the tools at their disposal to reflect the dynamism of competitive sport, as were pugilistic verbs – “kill”, “slaughter”, “slay” – which Himid also disliked. “I wonder whether some of the time you’re really saying we shouldn’t have commissioned that piece,” said Woodward – to which Himid responded, “I mostly think the articles are totally brilliant. There are so many layers and levels to what’s going on, but sometimes the surface lets that down.”As she laid out her finished work, the most intractable issue appeared to be the juxtaposition of editorial content with advertising. Himid was astonished to discover that late deadlines and separate digital planners mean the editor of Weekend does not routinely see, or sign off on, advertising in the magazine. An inside image of Ajadi was offset by a prominent full page advertisement for an insurance firm themed on “3,475 shades of white to argue over”. This was one problem that should soon be reduced, hoped Denes, by a new system to amalgamate planning systems for editorial and advertising.While accepting that she is an unusual reader, in that her perspective is entirely visual, Himid argues that her interpretation is available to anyone. “If you are sitting reading a magazine on a train, the person opposite you will be seeing both the front and back cover. These images are there, the juxtapositions are there, whether you intended them or not.”Her aim, she said, was simply to start a conversation. “It was a random selection of a random week and it really is just seeing what you did there. I know there are some incredible articles because I read them from beginning to end, as the rest of my family do every day.”While her Turner submission was entitled Negative Positives, the new one is called Random Coincidence – “because you all keep telling me that it’s a coincidence. It’s random. And I absolutely believe that is what you believe,” she says. “But please make a tiny bit of time in your day when you’re trying to push it out to consider how it’s going to look coming in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efeb78bb08c45d76acd5ca2d6629934e93b93bd4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f279f342c57eda550c767a0890d887","title":"best books of 2018 hilary mantel yuval noah harari and more pick their favourites","story":"Our favourite authors on the most outstanding books they read this yearby  Jonathan Franzen,  Hilary Mantel,  Yuval Noah Harari,  Olivia Laing,  Nicola Sturgeon,  Chris Ware and moreAgainst all reason and cultural prognostication, people keep writing terrific novels. Three that stood out for me this year were John Wray’s Godsend (published in the UK by Canongate in January), Kate Greathead’s Laura \u0026amp Emma (Simon \u0026amp Schuster), and Donal Ryan’s From a Low and Quiet Sea (Doubleday). Godsend ridiculously posits that a teenage girl from Santa Rosa, California, might disguise herself as a boy and attempt to join the Taliban. It’s a book that has no right to work at all, but Wray’s storytelling is so taut, his prose so laser-etched, his psychology so audacious, and his wisdom so much the opposite of conventional, that it ends up working brilliantly. Greathead, too, in Laura \u0026amp Emma has set herself a mighty challenge: to create sympathy for a disgustingly privileged Wasp family in New York. It’s a tough sell, and she makes it with masterly deftness, funny sentence by funny sentence. By the end, what seems to have been a casually episodic narrative reveals itself to be a moving and intricately braided story of two mothers. From a Low and Quiet Sea is similarly late-detonating. It tells the stories of three utterly disparate characters – a Syrian refugee, a feckless young Irish bus driver and a master of Irish graft – and proceeds to confound those of us who don’t like it when novelists withhold pertinent information. The book has stayed with me. All three of these books have stayed with me. I’m starting to wonder if we’re living in a literary golden age.What could I choose, but Diarmaid MacCulloch’s masterly Thomas Cromwell: A Life (Allen Lane)? For those less Tudor, An American Princess by Annejet van der Zijl (Amazon Crossing, translated by Michele Hutchison) is the story of Allene Tew, a small-town banker’s daughter five times wed, to gamblers, stockbrokers and finally royals. Light and gracefully written, it dances through a century of history, costing out the American dream like a feminine complement to the National Theatre’s absorbing Lehman Trilogy.Michael Pollan’s How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics (Allen Lane) changed my mind, or at least some of the ideas held in my mind. Pollan takes a fresh look at the controversial history of psychedelic drugs, highlighting their positive potential without hiding their dangerous side. It is all too easy for a spiritual quest for truth to mutate into a consumerist pursuit of excitement. Whatever one may think of psychedelics, the book reminds us that the mind is the greatest mystery in the universe, that this mystery is always right here, and that we usually dedicate far too little time and energy to exploring it. AI Superpowers by Kai-Fu Lee (Houghton Mifflin) is a superb and very timely survey of the impact of AI on the geopolitical system, the job market and human society. Unlike most books of its kind, it is written from the perspective of China rather than Silicon Valley. It raises important concerns about the cataclysmic disruptions AI might cause, and avoids the naive techno-utopianism that reigns on both sides of the Pacific. If the AI superpowers enter an escalating arms race, whoever wins, humanity will be the loser. In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism and Progress (Penguin), Steven Pinker extols the amazing achievements of modernity, and demonstrates that humankind has never been so peaceful, healthy and prosperous. It is the most optimistic book I’ve read in a long time. There is, of course, much to disagree with and to argue about, but that’s what makes this book so interesting.Normally I’d steer clear of recommending prize winners, but this year’s Man Booker winner Milkman by Anna Burns (Faber) is outstanding and without a doubt my favourite book of the year. It’s the story of a young woman growing up in 1970s Belfast (though the city, like most of the characters, is not named), struggling to cope with the unwanted sexual attention of a paramilitary. It is an immersive and unsettling read that rewards perseverance through the first few pages, as the narrator’s voice establishes itself in the reader’s mind. In non-fiction, Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership (Viking) is an excellent portrait of the leadership traits, particularly through times of national challenge, of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin D Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Again, a timely and rewarding read.This year, I loved Bitter by Francesca Jakobi (W\u0026ampN), an incredibly moving novel about a mother’s guilt and shame at her inability to bond with her son. It is a beautifully woven tale that tilts with issues of class and race and religion. The reader’s feelings towards the protagonist always balance somewhere between pity and indignation, never drifting towards any simplistic sense of certainty. In the vein of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, The Incurable Romantic (Little, Brown) is a compilation of the real-life case studies of a clinical psychologist, but here focused on the tenebrous world of obsessive love. There is a danger that this kind of book can come across as dry and unengaging, but Frank Tallis draws his characters with such wit and skill that at times it reminded me of novels such as The Collector or Enduring Love.Judging the Man Booker prize brought many delightful surprises this year. Apart from those, I’d recommend Stuart Turton’s The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle to anyone who loves complexity and conundrums Elly Griffiths’ The Stranger Diaries (Quercus) for lovers of gothic suspense, tempered with one of the most engaging detectives I’ve encountered in a long time and Lou Berney’s November Road (HarperCollins), which shows that the Kennedy assassination remains fertile ground – conspiracy theory meets a bittersweet love story.Skin Deep by Liz Nugent (Penguin) is a twisted thriller, reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith. A scarred woman brings chaos to those around her, but Nemesis is coming. Kill ’Em All by John Niven (W\u0026ampH) is like Martin Amis’s Money retooled for the age of Trump a gleefully vicious and vulgar satire on the music industry, fame and greed. Robin Robertson’s The Long Take (Picador) is a 200-page narrative poem about a second world war veteran seeking a living in LA and trying not to succumb to PTSD. Beautifully realised and filled with memorable imagery and phrasing to die for.The two children’s books I loved most this year are also two of the children’s books I’ve loved most this decade. One is The Murderer’s Ape, by Jakob Wegelius (Pushkin), out this year in paperback – a fast-paced adventure story told from the point of view of a brilliantly clever and impeccably polite ape, Sally Jones. The other, Hilary McKay’s The Skylarks’ War (Macmillan), is a rare thing: a story that traverses a decade in 300 pages, a book about the first world war that feels utterly fresh, and a portrait of kindness and courage that never dips into sentimentality. McKay is always a joy and this is her best book yet, I think.Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina (Granta) is not only a step forward for comic strip literary fiction, but a book that shows, as well as tells, the slippery horrors of our post-truth reality. In Olivier Schrauwen’s mind-inverting masterpiece Parallel Lives (Fantagraphics), the cartoonist’s alien abduction branches into a series of funny and frightening psychosexual ruminations on the nature of relationships that feel as fresh and strange as human life actually is. Manga pioneer Tadao Tsuge’s awkward, unsentimental and sometimes Chekhovian short comics from the 1960s and 70s delineate the violent, desperate wanderers of postwar Tokyo’s red-light districts. In Slum Wolf (New York Review Comics), translator Ryan Holmberg, one of the world’s finest comics writers, smoothes out the folds and expertly sets the historical scene so that readers (and graphic novelists like me) find they still have a whole lot to learn.Suzanne Batty’s States of Happiness (Bloodaxe) is an extraordinary collection that explores mental anguish. It begins with a complex sequence of poems in memory of her twin sister, who died of a rare degenerative disease. Though the book is dark and disturbing, it is also filled with chinks of light. The poems are as compelling as any thriller and full of insight and empathy. Nadine Aisha Jassat’s Let Me Tell You This (404 Ink) is a punchy, powerful debut collection that investigates what it means to be of dual heritage. The poems capture with real panache the secret lives of women, and they’re poignant, too. Pretend You Don’t Know Me (Bloodaxe), by South African Finula Dowling, is a witty and wise collection of new and selected poems. Her sequence about her mother’s dementia is very touching. Elsewhere, these vital works will have you crying with laughter.Bluntly cutting through much condescending nonsense written about millennials, Malcolm Harris’s Kids These Days (Little, Brown) describes how many of their private neuroses are socially constructed – strategies of survival in the bleak world they have inherited from their elders. The monographs of Byung Chul-Han, including What Is Power? and The Expulsion of the Other (Polity), can be read as companion pieces to Harris’s book. Whether analysing the smartphone or the notion of beauty on Instagram, this Korean-born German philosopher always has astute things to say about the many seductive forms of coercion and conformity today. Maria Tumarkin’s shape-shifting Axiomatic (Brow) deploys all the resources of narrative, reportage and essay. It is a work of great power and beauty. With mainstream journalism investing most of its analytical energy in the foggy concept of populism, the most illuminating historical and sociological explanations of our age of crisis have come from small magazines and university presses. Kathleen Belew’s superbly comprehensive Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America (Harvard) – which argues that a white power movement emerged as a reaction to the Vietnam war – supplants all journalistic accounts of America’s resurgent white supremacism. Few writers of fiction have chronicled American power and its psychic costs as steadily and briskly over the decades as Deborah Eisenberg. Your Duck Is My Duck (Ecco), her first collection of stories in 12 years, describes with eerie prescience many circles of America’s current moronic inferno.I gave up Twitter this year, with two immediate consequences: I started dreaming again and recovered a ferocious appetite for reading. Evenings, it turns out, are long. Like everyone, I loved Sally Rooney’s beautifully observed Normal People (Faber). I also finally read Eve Babitz’s Slow Days, Fast Company, first published in the 1970s but recently reissued by New York Review Books. It is funny, sexy and then suddenly brutal, like a shark attack at the beach. As for poetry, I fell hard for Amy Key’s Isn’t Forever (Bloodaxe), a gorgeous, sad box of delights about intimacy, bad bodies, sorrow. Like Babitz, Key is adept at linguistic surprises, charting women’s lives with a savage delicacy. But my favourite book, and you’d better be quick, is Blueprint, a tiny edition of photographs by the New York artist Mary Manning (JMS). Manning is truly a genius at unregarded, everyday beauty. Everything on the planet has been Instagrammed by now, and yet her casual, seemingly unstudied photos have the capacity to make the familiar world look absolutely new.Written in 1962 and reprinted again this year, every word, every sentence, every full-stop of Cassandra at the Wedding (Daunt) by Dorothy Baker had me in its clutches. I love books about small moments stretched out so wide you can observe the nuances and air bubbles that usually go unnoticed. Baker’s writing is immediate, strong and modern. She plumbs the deep emotional truth of human beings. Such sweet agony. The Secret Lives of Colour (John Murray) by Kassia St Clair is beautifully presented with the edges of the pages tinted different hues. The book is simply about colour. But colour is not simple. The history, geography, politics, scandals and influence of colours and shades are documented here with a lively and knowledgeable voice. With references from Jessica Rabbit to Lord Mountbatten, from Greek poets to slavery, this is a fascinating read. You can dip into specific colours or read it straight through like I did.An Anarchy of Chillies by Caz Hildebrand (Thames \u0026amp Hudson) is bold and bright, each variety given its own unique design, represented with brilliant illustrations. It’s a must for anyone who’s serious about their chillies, their graphic design, or both. Lateral Cooking by Niki Segnit (Bloomsbury) is all about confidence: confidence in skill, flavours and technique. Knowledgeable and humorous, with a focus on flavour and technique, this cookbook is informative, useful and sure to become a kitchen bible to many. Gill Meller’s latest cookbook Time (Quadrille) is poetic and romantic – a string of beautiful recipes guide you through the seasons. Fig and seville marmalade buns are perfect for a warming winter breakfast while fried mackerel with tomatoes, garlic and herbs are quintessential summer.I’ve been giving thanks all year for the crucial act of contextualisation in Sarah Churchwell’s Behold, America (Bloomsbury), which reveals language, history and consequence as all joined at the hip and for Lyndsey Stonebridge’s Placeless People (Oxford), a stunning study as much of literature’s own “endurance beyond the nation, and its worldly capacity to conjure up human community out of despair” as of migrant refuge and the powerplay of state refusal of refuge, via the 20th century’s great writers of displacement. Also, a book of essays by Alexander Nemerov, Summoning Pearl Harbor (David Zwirner) works like poetry on history, nationality, memory and aesthetic form and in a unifying and liberating meditation opens all their closures. In fiction I was taken with Helen McClory’s On the Edges of Vision (404 Ink). Her edgy stories transmit the strangeness of realities in a way that’s comforting precisely because so unsettling. She’s a writer completely unafraid. I was also left amazed, again, at the blitheness, the nonchalant courage, with which Kate Atkinson – whose new novel Transcription (Transworld) is another formal high-wire act – regularly renews, as if it’s second nature, the possibilities of the novel form.Richard Powers’s The Overstory (Heinemann) is among the best novels I’ve read this decade. I would describe it as a towering redwood were it not so committed to a model of complex and reciprocal relations between humans and the more-than-human world. Better thought of as a teeming ecosystem or biome of a novel, then, which enacts in its structures a version of the symbiosis it advances as an ethic. Beyond its experiment in form, it is dazzlingly written at the levels of the sentence and the sequence (the book’s understorey). Powers is as brilliant on trees and arborescence as he has been in past novels on music, AI and neuroscience. The novel arrives at a time when deforestation in the name of “growth” has become a flashpoint for protest politics in Sheffield, Germany (Hambach), India (Delhi) and dozens of other countries despite its deep-time perspective, it could hardly be more of-the-moment. Daegan Miller’s This Radical Land: A Natural History of American Dissent (Chicago) stands as analytical counterpart to Powers’s novel: a fascinating, often hopeful journey through the landscape histories of “vibrant resistance” – anarchism, anti-slavery movements, social-justice activists – that have sprung up across North America over the last two centuries. Rebecca Solnit’s Call Them By Their True Names (Granta) is another vibrantly resisting work, that calls out euphemism (“climate change” should be “climate violence”) and celebrates good naming where it is practised. Lastly, like many readers I was gripped by Guy Gunaratne’s remarkable debut novel, In Our Mad and Furious City (Tinder), with its complex cast of lonely Londoners and its brave, poetic polyphony of voices.Make Ink: A Forager’s Guide to Natural Inkmaking (Abrams) by Jason Logan is a remarkable book on the alchemy of inkmaking – yes, making your own inks – that combines science, art, craft and foraging. You will never again look at rust, soot, peach stones, or fag ends in the same way. As President Obama’s photographer, Pete Souza was one of the very finest official White House snappers. In his provocative Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents (Sphere), he contrasts pictures of the 44th incumbent with vignettes from the administration of the 45th to caustic effect. Mark Dery’s Born to Be Posthumous: The Eccentric Life and Mysterious Genius of Edward Gorey (William Collins) is a detailed, devoted and highly readable biography of the illustrator who – from The Doubtful Guest to The Curious Sofa – defined and embodied a world of camp, gothic hilarity.One of my favourite books this year was Robin Robertson’s The Long Take (Picador). Crossing genre boundaries, it is a moving, melancholic and strangely inspiring poem that tells the story of a D-Day veteran as he travels across three big cities in the US. He is a broken flâneur, a man stuck between worlds, and this is a book about the invisible wounds we carry with us everywhere about not being able to go home, yet still finding the courage, or the animal instinct, to carry on. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber), the last in her trilogy, stayed with me long after I had finished it. Composed of a series of conversations, it is captivating and incredibly well written. Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador) is simply mesmerising, not only in the way in which it enters the mind of an iconic woman, Kathy Acker, but also for its originality, inventiveness and chutzpah. And Richard Holloway’s Waiting for the Last Bus (Canongate) is a real gem: a tender book, brimming with wisdom, beauty and compassion. Reading Holloway is like taking a long walk in the countryside – afterwards, you understand the world better, you feel less lonely.Henry Hardy has self-effacingly devoted the larger part of his professional career to the editing, promoting and celebrating of the work of Isaiah Berlin. In Search of Isaiah Berlin: A Literary Adventure (IB Tauris) looks back over his long labours of love with fondness, a fine dry wit and a light salting of justified irritation at those entrusted with Berlin’s posthumous affairs. The second part consists of Hardy’s own philosophical response to Berlin’s theories on matters such as plurality, religious belief and our shared human nature. A wonderful book on a wonderful subject. It would surely take the staunchest of bird fanciers to stand up for the poor old seagull – or plain gull, as it has become, since it took to the dumps – but that is what Tim Dee does, and does persuasively, in his fascinating, funny and bravely titled Landfill (Little Toller). To say his book is about gulls would be like saying that Lolita is about paedophilia. Sue Prideaux’s ill-advisedly titled I Am Dynamite! (Faber) is the biography Friedrich Nietzsche has been crying out for since the day he lost his reason and embraced a horse in a Turin square in 1889. Prideaux brings a calm and steady light to bear on this most incandescent of philosopher-poets, with illuminating results. Her book is a disgracefully entertaining read into the bargain.A novel that really got under my skin this year was Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation (Cape), a work of delinquent brilliance about a bereaved young woman who, with the help of a quack GP and an array of cures for the condition of consciousness, spends an entire year in hibernation in her New York apartment. It’s relentlessly dark, frequently very funny, and establishes Moshfegh as a uniquely gifted diagnostician of contemporary absurdity. And then there was Sally Rooney’s Normal People (Faber), which, like everyone else who read it, I consumed at reckless speed and with rare pleasure. Rooney has a mysterious ability to pull the reader in – gently, casually, inexorably – to her world on the very first page. She writes with a distinctive combination of lightness and absolute seriousness of purpose. I can’t remember the last time I got so personally invested in the lives of invented people. (Actually, I remember exactly when it was: it was last year, with Rooney’s previous book, Conversations with Friends.) In non-fiction, the book that has burrowed most deeply into the recesses of my brain was New Dark Age (Verso) by the artist and critic James Bridle. The more sophisticated technology has become, Bridle argues, and the more our lives are saturated with information, the less capable we are of understanding our world. It’s unsettling people have taken me to task for encouraging them to read it and causing them to lose actual sleep. But for all its bleakness, it has illuminated the present for me like no other recent book I’ve read.• This article was corrected on 3 December 2018.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Let’s start with a burst of genius. James Joyce’s Ulysses has impressed originalabsence:Rereading Ulysses, surely the very pinnacle of literature in English. Take this:“Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.”Talking of strange talent, Richard Brautigan’s The Hawkline Monster has delighted Tom Mooney:Yes, more Brautigan! More glorious Brautigan!This is another gem from the deadpan comic genius himself. I just can’t get enough at the moment. Every book feels like a little treat, just for me.

However those locals include washed up football players, sexually frustrated former cheerleaders, racists, rapists, and trainers of vicious fighting dogs. There is certainly plenty of the grotesque, bizarre and menace in Crews’s honest examination of dark side of humanity.Despite its horrors the story is compelling. Sparsely written, fast moving and brutally frank Crews examines the cause of his disfunction in his characters and the consequences their actions have on those around them. It is devastating in its directness and intensity, and a great example of the power of fiction.It’s difficult to imagine how so many of Crews’s other books are out of print.Sounds like annegeraldine has come to the conclusion most of us come to while enjoying Jane Austen’s final masterpiece, Persuasion:I’m half way through Persuasion.

Outside, children ride bikes and old men play cards in a coffee shop. But before May this year, this building looked rather different. A sign hung outside reading: “Golden Dawn, Heraklion region”. The ultra-nationalist, far-right Greek party used this street as its local base.It was local teachers who first spotted its influence. “Two of my 13-year-old students had family problems,” recalls Maria Oikonomaki, 50. “Golden Dawn approached them in cafes and the gym, presenting themselves as family and protectors. They took them for coffee and gave them lessons on Greek history.”Then came the violence, including the stabbing of two Pakistani workers. “I thought to myself: ‘My god, what is happening in this neighbourhood?’” says Oikonomaki.​Despite the attacks, Golden Dawn might ​have kept its foothold in Heraklion – or ​dug in deeper – had the city’s residents not decided to fight back.Golden Dawn was formed in 1980 and remained a fringe party until Greece’s devastating financial crisis started in 2009. As faith in the major political parties ebbed away, Golden Dawn’s narrative of a once-great nation ruined by immigration struck a chord with some disillusioned voters. As well as becoming the third-largest party in the Greek parliament, it also established a street-based paramilitary wing that regularly attacked immigrants and political opponents.The area it chose in Heraklion was the eastern suburb of Nea Alikarnassos. A working-class neighbourhood, it has a long history of immigration from Asia Minor and eastern Europe. Many residents are employed in construction and lost their jobs during the crisis. Golden Dawn quietly opened its office here in 2011.Crete’s anti-fascist movement initially struggled to fight back. “Our philosophy is that you never let the far right get hold of public space,” says Konstantinos (not his real name), a militant anti-fascist in his early 20s. “In warmer countries like Greece, public space is where the working class spends their lives. Wherever fascists are present, you have to make your presence felt too.”So, when they found out about the new office, Konstantinos and other activists arranged a neighbourhood assembly. “There was a general consensus that people didn’t want Golden Dawn in the area,” he says, “but not enough people came to support the assembly. We realised we couldn’t have a presence in the area all the time. We tried to keep an eye on them, but there wasn’t much we could do.”In September 2012, everything changed. In a crime that shocked the country, the prominent anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas was allegedly murdered on Golden Dawn’s orders. Huge protests broke out and 69 members of the party, including its leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, and 18 MPs, were arrested and charged with running a criminal organisation. Their trial is ongoing.“Before this, a lot of people had the attitude of ‘We do not fear Golden Dawn, we just need to educate them’,” says Haris Zafiropoulos, a 27-year-old activist with New Left Current, a coalition of left-wing groups.Activists such as Zafiropoulos embarked on a new strategy: taking to the streets and engaging in face-to-face conversations about fascism and why it needed to be confronted.“Every weekend we went to the neighbourhood and spoke to people,” Zafiropoulos says. “Crete suffered a lot from the Nazis in the second world war, and whole villages were burned down. We tried to remind people what had happened before, and what is happening now.”Meanwhile, across Crete, teachers rallied to address the radicalisation taking place in schools. “The way the fascists moved within the pupil community was so clever and so sneaky, we did not realise what was going on at first,” says Fotis Bichakis, founder of the Cretan League of Anti-Fascist Teachers. “It was easy for young students who were feeling frustrated to become manipulated.”The teachers worked together to prepare lesson plans that taught history in a less nationalist way and explained and confronted fascist ideologies. The following spring, 56 schools collaborated on an anti-fascist festival.The teachers chose not to view already-recruited students as lost causes. “We always had faith they could come back to democratic ideals,” adds Bichakis. “As they saw more of their peers joining in with anti-fascism, they began to question whether they had been misled.”Oikonomaki says she believes the strategy stopped any more of her pupils being radicalised. “We had students from Albania, Romania, Bulgaria,” she says. “I’d tell pupils: ‘Golden Dawn says other people are inferior to Greeks. Do you really think that about your friend John you sit next to every day?’”Militant activists also made the controversial decision to confront the group violently. In April 2018, Konstantinos and around 70 other anti-fascists organised a night attack on the Heraklion office. “We destroyed everything of value – the floors, the ceilings, the AC unit,” he says. “We think that was the final straw for them.”Indeed, Golden Dawn packed up and left two weeks later.Not everyone in the community is happy about the violence. “It’s important we don’t come across as two sides of the same coin,” says Zafiropoulos.Konstantinos, however, is unrepentant. “It worked!” he says. “We may not be able to stop Golden Dawn becoming celebrities in the media, but we can stop them spreading their roots within Greek society. Crete is the first major region of Greece to have no Golden Dawn presence … We have effectively stopped them from having any space to reproduce.”Elsewhere in Greece, the far right appears to be on the rise again. The country’s dispute with Macedonia over its name has led to swell of nationalism, and there have been violent attacks on politicians and asylum-seekers. Halikiopoulou believes anti-fascist activism of the type used in Crete can work “on a local level. But opposition cannot and should not be confined to the anti-fascist left. We need something on a more organised, mainstream level.”Oikonomaki is wary of saying the battle is fully over. “We could easily communicate who Golden Dawn were and why they were bad,” she says. “But the crisis is not over, and people still want to put the blame on someone. Hidden fascism is almost more dangerous.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10892b1db01fb04e80a70f1ae8258b773b2be7c2/0_154_3823_2293/master/3823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afe8a6570109679698ac1daac8ed3081","title":"brexit deal theresa may cliff edge","story":"This deal is the best the UK can expect for now. The prime minister must do everything in her power to get it throughFor goodness sake, Theresa May, you have nothing to lose. Do whatever the waverers want. Publish the legal advice on backstop. Publish the Home Office white paper (call it green) on immigration post-Brexit. Go to Brussels and say you must have one last attempt at even the tiniest adjustment to the backstop. Otherwise all Brussels’ work on Brexit will have been a waste of time. Who on earth wants that? At least it is worth one last try. Otherwise we are doomed to a crash.The course of Brexit is now so shambolic that each day produces a new lurch towards the cliff edge. But it is not helped by May still appearing to be on planet zog. Her energy has been awesome and her conviction truly impressive. But her mantras seem wooden and unreal. She should be frank and admit that this deal is not very good, and that is because it was never going to be.Boris Johnson’s madcap “have our cake and eat it” slogan was infantile. Neither he nor his ramshackle hard Brexiters have ever presented a remotely plausible alternative. Whatever nonsense was talked during 2016, hard Brexit was going to be wretched to negotiate – which is why those who tried have all resigned. Brussels is the senior partner in any deal, and would not make it easier. So there was no point in presenting any deal to the British people as advantageous. It is the least-worst option, not the pretend-best.May is rightly determined to forestall no deal, a responsibility abdicated by almost everyone else in parliament. To her, the price of moving on to the next stage of Brexit is staying, for the time being, in the customs union. But since this is supposedly what most MPs want, in some shape or form, why do they not back her? And why does she not sell it to them in these terms – that she is indeed just kicking this can down the road into the transition period. May finds it hard to make conviction sound convincing. The country needs some indication that she sees things as it does: facing an emergency that requires humility and realism from the person in charge.There are clear signs of furniture starting to shift in the fog. A majority of MPs – not least in the wavering centre on which the deal depends – appear to want a form of Brexit along the spectrum of a customs unionsingle marketNorway option. That option is plainly available under the deal’s political addendum. Were it formally on the table as the long-term answer to Brexit, as it should be, putting it to another referendum would make sense. For the time being, some last attempt to get the deal as it stands must be the least damaging way of getting through the next three months. Not to see this is wilfully negligent of MPs. Just when the country wants them to rise above party, they revert to their most basic instincts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a638ddc90ac195509bcf60a07d3ec7083adcfef2/235_475_3092_1855/master/3092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9b6fa385eef0efa897e54dd7fc1a24","title":"hiding prince bin salman g20 summit","story":"New friends are made, old friends are reunited – and Donald Trump thinks he’s on I’m a Celebrity …Remember last year’s G20 summit, when Angela Merkel started grinding on people when Kraftwerk came on? And Christine Lagarde got trashed and started telling maths-based jokes and nobody knew what she was on about?This year’s was just as much a hoot, rivalling a D12 after-show or one of B*Witched’s legendary house parties. Fun and games in Buenos Aires with the odd autocratic murder suspect thrown in. And who among us doesn’t like to stand in front of flags all day reading off an autocue? Who doesn’t love running out of water 20 minutes into a 90-minute long meeting? Who isn’t hyped to hide in a lift to avoid Mohammed bin Salman?Allow me to take you through some of the key moments of the summit: the highlights, the lowlights, the actual dying of the light.This picture could not look more like a couple’s therapy session immediately after they are asked, “Right, who wants to begin then?” by an analyst wearing half-glasses on a chain. Nobody says anything and then both burst into complaints at once. Extra amusingly, it looks like one of the chair feet is Theresa May’s leg. A tiny, tiny leg. I may or may not have laughed at this for far too long. Anyway, that’s £90 please – see you next Tuesday, same time?This is Angela Merkel surrounded by mere mortals and checking her watch, having absolutely no time for them because she is, for a bit longer at least, the de facto leader of Europe and she studied quantum chemistry. Angela doesn’t wanna hear it, whatever it is. Did you study quantum chemistry? Well then.In further proof that ANGELA DOESN’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, here she sits across from Australian prime minister Scott Morrison brazenly reading (genuinely) what amounts to a Wikipedia printout on Scott Morrison. She’s allowed to do this, because she is the de facto leader of Europe and she studied quantum chemistry.Just when you think it’s impossible for Donald Trump to become any more like Selina Meyer (as seen in Veep) he raises the bar. Here he is wandering from the stage, leaving Argentine president Mauricio Macri nonplussed and embarrassed in front of the assembled press, while an aide runs after Trump who can be heard murmuring, “Get me out of here.” I’m A F*cking Idiot, Get Me Out of Here!Here is Xi Jinping making the exact face women make when random men on public transport insist on interrupting them so we have to take a headphone out, and then they ask a banal question, followed by: “Sorry, am I interrupting?” Yes, this is the definition of interrupting. Petition idea: to allow women to listen to This American Life for at least two stops. And no, I don’t fancy coffee some time.This photo is very “one minute pause before The X Factor winner is announced”. Get ready for either Paraguay’s president, Mario Abdo Benitez, or Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe to be signed to Simon Cowell’s Syco (I see what you did there!!) label for all of five minutes release a cover butchering a pop classic and then quietly return to the pub-and-club circuit with all promo materials bearing a low-quality X Factor logo, definitely breaking trademark laws.In extraordinary scenes (a redundant phrase these days), here is Macron and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, having a low-key discussion (in front of a camera) in which MBS (More Bullshit) tells the French president, “Don’t worry.” Macron – speaking for all of us – replies, “I am worried.” He follows up, “You never listen to me.” This could be a normal leader-to-leader tiff, except it’s almost certainly about the fact one of them is a moral vacuum. Still – a great friend of the UK! :-))))This is what is known as a “nice one, human rights-suppressing bro!” high five. They are mostly done discreetly, and not audaciously in front of the world’s press, but who even gives a shit any more?I’d love to know who designed this awful backdrop, which looks like when the Daily Mail is forced to pixellate the face of a celebrity’s child, mostly because they’ve referred to her as being “leggy” despite the fact she is six years old. What we have here is Victoria Vorontsova, the deputy editor-in-chief of Spanish RT (I know), and Hernan Lombardi, the head of Argentina’s system of media and public content, holding certificates for taking part. Or that is what it looks like, judging by the expressions on their faces.I used to mock Melania Trump for still shoulder-robing like it was still 2012, but she does it so often now that I just genuinely don’t think she understands how sleeves work.Angela coming to steal your man. Who probably doesn’t even have a degree in quantum chemistry.Once again we have the camel-eyelashed Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, looking like a smug Ken doll who can almost certainly commune with dolphins and probably uses the Amaro filter on every Instagram picture he posts, mostly of lakes. He flirts with your mum all dinner and then rolls his shirt sleeves up – maybe even takes the whole thing off – and offers to do the washing up, even though there’s a dishwasher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b74f8063a5d17e790b7a44f74122956e12d89a30/87_0_2282_1369/master/2282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a92ee5660e989259d3f27fd9f01b9f7","title":"politicians bickering brexit abyss","story":"The only question worth asking is should we still do Brexit. The rest is a distractionLet the chronicles of this turbulent time record how the prime minister and the leader of the opposition agreed that Britain should leave the European Union, so they argued instead about which channel should host an argument between them. Theresa May wants to defend her Brexit deal on the BBC Jeremy Corbyn prefers to attack it on ITV. It is the perfect culmination of British politics since the referendum: a confected row over a piece of theatre to avoid a real debate.Parliament starts hearing arguments over May’s plan on Tuesday. This should be the final ascent, the peak of a democratic process, but the climb has been a mapless scramble through fog. The view from the summit will not be much clearer than it was in the foothills, when no one had a clue how to untangle EU membership, and only charlatans and fools said it would be easy.To expect lucidity from May is to ignore her record. This is the prime minister who coined “Brexit means Brexit” – a slogan so exquisitely vacuous it might be conceptual art. She knows no strategy beyond secrecy and the dead bat. Likewise, there is no evidence that Corbyn can bring public insight to a European dilemma. Last week, he was on breakfast television saying that Labour would have time to arrange a new Brexit deal in “a transition period which has already been now agreed”. But transition has been agreed as a condition of the deal Corbyn aims to destroy. What he said was either cynically misleading or frighteningly ill-informed.Both would be consistent with the pattern of politics since 2016. The referendum did little to inform or elevate national debate on all things European. On balance, the leave campaign was the more duplicitous of the two sides, but that is no reflection on the motive or character of leave voters. Ignorance of the EU was rife among remainers too. Pretty much everyone followed their gut no one was pondering phytosanitary inspections at busy ports. There was little grasp, on either side, of the strategic magnitude of what was being proposed – not just the uprooting and replanting of the economy, but fracturing the political alliance that has underpinned British foreign policy for a generation.We conspired to hold a referendum on leaving the EU without a serious conversation about what the EU even is, let alone what it does. Then, a year later, we got through a general election campaign with little mention of Europe at all. Another year has passed and, despite the urgency of the article 50 clock running out, politics still manages to distract itself with arguments other than the only one worth having, which is this: given what we now know about Brexit that we didn’t know then, should we still do it?That is not the question on which May and Corbyn would dwell in a televised debate (regardless of the channel). It isn’t a question that troubles hardline Tory backbenchers running up and down Westminster corridors in pursuit of letters of no confidence in their leader. It isn’t a question that can be answered by publication of the attorney general’s legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, prised piecemeal by opposition parties from the clenched fist of government. That isn’t to say these things are unimportant. It matters if Geoffrey Cox QC advises that the Irish “backstop” is a trapdoor to perpetual regulatory subordination. But it matters only as confirmation of a structural downside to Brexit that we know already – the imbalance of power between a bloc of 27 states and one quitter. There is no obscure parliamentary procedure or elegantly crafted amendment that changes the cost-benefit equation. May’s Brexit isn’t uniquely, freakishly deleterious to the national interest. It is just Brexit. If that’s what MPs want, they should vote for it. Either the price is worth paying, for whatever reason – a trade deal with Donald Trump, fewer Romanians on the bus, blue passports – or it isn’t.But I suspect we haven’t finished with displacement activity. There are still a few implausible 11th-hour renegotiations to be demanded. Labour can still call for a general election, without saying what the Brexit chapter in their manifesto would contain. The Tories might squeeze in a leadership contest. The drivel-soaked sponge of no-deal complacency has not been wrung completely dry on the Today programme. Boris Johnson is still at large. Nigel Farage has space in his diary.It is tempting to decry an excess of game-playing in British public life, but that doesn’t do justice to the debasement. A bit of sporting mischief is a normal aspect of politics. Sometimes the play gets a bit dirty sometimes we all take our eye off the ball. But in the current climate it feels as if the pitch itself and the goals have been forgotten altogether. Politics has become endless fighting in the stands, while sensible people flee the stadium.I can see why this spectacle puts people off another referendum. Not much about the past few years promises a festival of reasoned dialogue. But I also want to resist such fatalism. When politicians say that another vote would be isive and bitter, they are wriggling out from responsibility to raise the tone themselves. They mean they cannot imagine doing politics differently. Actually, it isn’t a warning but a threat: proceed with Brexit or we will degrade your public discourse even further. Submission to that menace is not a good reason to leave the EU, it just adds to the list of bad ones.Maybe it is fanciful to imagine a different kind of campaign, one that would be seized as an opportunity to rehabilitate responsible political debate. In more optimistic moments, I hope there is one more chapter in the Brexit chronicle, written in a style more befitting the seriousness of the question. Otherwise what is the story being told about our democracy? We bickered for years on the edge of an abyss, then dropped wearily in because we could no longer trust ourselves to discuss the merit in jumping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e7fa1c7e91901b968b3e005d28fb1ffe60e3276/739_645_4926_2956/master/4926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0de069bc648d3c9b05f3f0ded27de7a","title":"the guardian view on disability and the arts time for change","story":"For years, the arts in the UK have made ersity a priority and, gradually, this is paying off. On stage, audiences are used to black actors taking on roles in Shakespeare plays gender-blind casting is gaining ground black and minority ethnic leaders are slowly being appointed to major roles – such as, recently, Kwame Kwei-Armah at the Young Vic and Madani Younis at the Southbank Centre, both in London. But there is one area in which change has been all but imperceptible: disability. Britain’s Got Talent – and its last winner, the comedian Lost Voice Guy – has done more for the popular standing of artists with disabilities in Britain than any of its publicly funded cultural organisations.Directors and trustees of arts organisations – those who can make change at the top by appointing leaders – are overwhelmingly able-bodied. This makes it depressing, but not necessarily a surprise, that not a single publicly funded arts body is run by a disabled person, except for those organisations with a specific disability arts focus. And that is just the staff: access for disabled audience members to culture, from museums and galleries to theatres and concert halls, can be terrible, leading to miserable experiences (or simply no possibility of access at all), especially for those who use wheelchairs. The Edinburgh fringe is a particular culprit – understandable to an extent from young companies working on a shoestring, but not from huge commercial promoters who have the resources to do better.There is also a lack of understanding of the needs of those with disabilities among those who work in the arts, which can lead to some embarrassing, hurtful and cruel episodes – such as when a young woman with Asperger’s was ejected from a BFI screening this spring (for which the organisation has since apologised).This has to change, and the government is to be commended for appointing a disability champion for arts and culture to address these problems. There are a number of simple measures that could help. For instance, the UK-wide adoption of the kind of disability charter that Northern Ireland has used for the past 20 years, which enshrines the rights of audience members and lays out best practice for employers. Bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund should consider targeted grants to make venues – and, importantly, their offices – accessible to disabled people. There is much that could, and should, be done to make training, apprenticeships and arts-focused higher education more available to people with disabilities. An “arts access card” would ease the problems that disabled people often encounter when attempting to book tickets – something Wales is already doing with its Hynt card. The UK’s arts organisations pride themselves on their openness, fairness and visionary thinking. Now is the time to act on those principles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/984e3b84f009091064cd870148e4d9ea4a81ff0d/0_45_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af444afd5fc25718a80de207ce934b0","title":"campaigners criticise 50m fund for grammar schools expansion","story":"Headteachers and campaigners fighting cuts to special needs education call move ‘sickening’Headteachers and campaigners for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) have reacted with fury to a government announcement that 16 grammar schools are to split a £50m bonus to create new school places.Making the announcement on Monday, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, said the 16 schools chosen to receive the additional funding out of 39 applications had been given permission to expand after setting out clear actions to prioritise access for disadvantaged children.“I have always been clear that selective schools will only be able to expand if they meet the high bar we have set for increasing access for disadvantaged children, and all of these schools have done that,” Hinds said. “As a result, countless more children from disadvantaged areas will benefit from places at outstanding schools.”Headteachers who have been campaigning for months to highlight the funding crisis in their schools described the move as “ill-judged”. Campaigners who are fighting SEND cuts to their children’s education through the courts said it was “sickening”.“It’s difficult to stomach the backdoor expansion of grammar schools while inclusive schools are being financially penalised and special educational needs funding is in crisis,” said a spokesperson for SEND Family Action. “Attending these schools is simply not an option for many pupils with SEND.”Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the £50m boost would benefit very few children. “Yet again the government shows its complete lack of understanding of the huge funding crisis in our schools. This will be a huge disappointment to the majority of non selective schools and colleges facing financial hardship.”Headteachers who marched on Westminster in September to bring the financial crisis in their schools to the attention of ministers also expressed their disappointment. Jules White, the headteacher of Tanbridge House school in West Sussex and leader of the Worth Less? fair funding lobby, which represents 7,000 headteachers across 60 local authorities, said all schools deserved better funding.“When the Department for Education only ever talks about efficiencies rather than proper investment for schools, we are concerned that today’s announcement is ill-judged. In short, it will cost £12,500 to fund each new place under this capital expansion project.“It seems that the Treasury and the DfE can always find money for projects that suit an ideological direction. At the same time, when the need to fund each child’s education properly arises, we are told that money is in short supply.”The opening of new grammar schools is barred by legislation passed under Tony Blair’s government in 1998, but the current government has made plain it is keen to increase the number of grammar school places, and in May Hinds announced the selective schools expansion fund, despite fierce opposition from educationalists and policy-makers.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “Today’s announcement is a stark reminder that the Conservatives have nothing to offer the overwhelming majority of schools apart from more cuts.“At a time when the chancellor promises only ‘little extras’ for almost every school, the government are handing out millions to a handful of cherry-picked grammar schools which will do nothing for almost every child in the country.” The government says the 16 grammar schools who have been awarded the additional funds have pledged to prioritise children who are eligible for the pupil premium for admission – these are children from the lowest income families.The schools also had to outline measures to improve outreach to children and families who might not otherwise consider applying to grammar school, including free entrance test materials available online and visits to primary schools and mentoring by sixth formers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

This year she was promoted to the Ministry of Justice, where her brief includes digital justice, court closures and legal aid.An online appeals service for people disputing social security and children support payments has reduced response times by more than a third, the MoJ says.“We want to be in a position where the judge can liaise with an applicant through emails,” Frazer said. Known as “asynchronous” hearings in the jargon of online justice, it allows judges to accumulate evidence as soon as possible as claimants send it in, without requiring everyone to be in court at the same time. More people are likely to get the chance to plead to criminal offences online. The scheme is currently restricted to low-level offences such as travelling on trains without a ticket. An expanded version is likely to be included in the next round of legislation, Frazer confirmed.Remote video hearings are becoming more widespread in civil and criminal justice. Some criminal lawyers fear it makes it more difficult to conduct confidential consultations with clients.Frazer pledged that if justice went online it would remain transparent and open to reporting and the public. However, she could not promise there would be no more court closures. More than 250 have shut in England and Wales since 2010. Proceeds from their sale fund the court modernisation programme.Addressing the conference earlier, Burnett said: “Look at the dispute resolution system operated by eBay dealing with 60m complaints a year. Quick, inexpensive and effective for those who use it. We should not be frightened by learning from them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3cbf27abbd6485711a4276d9f729054a8e1f60/0_176_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b9bea893f3683c548e846e4c59e902","title":"take back control could self sufficiency be the answer to a no deal brexit","story":"I moved with my husband and kids to rural Kent to try to grow our own food to alleviate even the harshest crisis next year. Unfortunately, crops are as complicated as the latest withdrawal agreementIn January 2017, my husband, Jared, and I moved our family from a semi in Ramsgate to a ramshackle house in rural Kent that came with two acres of mud. Our desire for change was born of the political, social and environmental turmoil. There was certainly a naive pursuit of the good life, but we were also reeling from the outcome of the Brexit referendum and feeling sick about Trump’s presidency. We needed a personal survival plan.In the face of a world shifting in a direction we could no longer understand, predict or rely on (and despite having no practical skills or experience), we sought a shared vocation that was less tied to systems and structures that appeared to be wobbling. We planned to grow and raise some of our own food and – as wildfires, floods and landslides hinted at the impact of climate change – move towards a more sustainable way of life. It felt like a personal resistance that would be good for our family life and physical and mental health, as well as teaching us new skills.Nearly two years on and we are mulching the fruit and vegetable garden as we wait to see if the Brexit plan will make it through parliament. Jared dumps wheelbarrow-loads of our own compost and leaf mould on the remnants of summer growing. I spread it out in a thick blanket over each square bed, starving the most pernicious weeds of light and making the 300-metre square look neat and ready to work again. The worms will do the work of digging it in and the roots I’ve left in the soil will hold it together and help keep the microbial life of our garden thriving. As I rake, I wonder if parliament could do with a couple of thousand tonnes of mulch about now.Making time for these kind of jobs alongside our freelance careers is harder than we had anticipated. Balancing the care of chickens, ducks, geese and goats – not to mention two children aged five and eight – while growing and preserving food, making our house more fit for sustainable living and clinging on to threads of sanity is too much at times. Our new life is often lovely and we are very grateful for it. Yet it’s also full of hard, time-consuming work that can feel endless and that we have to shoehorn into slivers of time.Progress is slow. We have put in a log burner and acquired a few months’ supply of seasoned logs in a neighbourly exchange of old fencing posts. That, alongside new external insulation and triple glazing, will help us need less electricity – handy should prices hike upwards in spring. The money ran out before we could install solar panels to allow us more freedom from the grid and minimise our carbon footprint. Instead we are considering all-in-one woollen underwear.The garden has been neglected after a busy summer. I am behind in my winter growing schedule and haven’t yet bought a polytunnel. With the stability of the food supply chain in question at the time of Brexit, our new skills could come into their own if I do my gardening due diligence. November is too late for planting much outdoors, but I will get a head start on spring with garlic sets, over-wintering onions and broad beans. I might try my hand at windowsill salad growing or ask for an indoor cultivation set for Christmas.The renewed interest in grow-your-own and self-sufficiency can be seen in the vast array of books and products for aspiring home producers. Fermentation, pickling and preserving have gone from being niche interests to fashionable pursuits. Although allotment numbers seem to have plateaued after a recent sharp rise, community growing schemes are expanding rapidly. Chris Blythe, the director of the Social Farms \u0026amp Gardens network, notes a substantial increase in the number of community food-growing projects across the UK over the past decade, “clearly linked”, he says, “to a number of social- and health-related concerns including austerity, the need for better connected communities, the health and wellbeing agenda, and the growing awareness of food security as a concern for all”.Claire Harris (not her real name) runs a food co-operative in Wales alongside a small community garden. After supplying local cooking projects with ingredients, and donating a significant amount to a nearby food bank, Harris has little left for herself, particularly as a long winter and summer drought have taken a toll on the harvest. She wishes she could be more self-sufficient, feeling that the “government and business don’t give a damn about us”. In a month when the UN’s special rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights has accused the British government of needlessly inflicting “great misery” on its people with austerity measures (as indicated by the soaring use of food banks), it is hard not to sympathise with her view.Perhaps it’s not surprising that we’re far from the only idealists whose dreams of self-sufficiency are mingled with political concerns. Amy Walker, 33, and her partner moved to a Kentish farmhouse in July this year and are trying to become as self-reliant as possible while preparing for a worst-case Brexit scenario. Their property was chosen for its potential to provide its own heating and it has an on-site water source. Walker and her partner are busy transforming their garden from lawn to “a productive garden that we can live off if Brexit doesn’t get stopped”. They plan to grow root vegetables, which can be stored or traded, are constructing a greenhouse for more tender crops and are using a damp nook to grow mushrooms.Our family’s desire to have our own supply of vegetables, eggs, cheese and milk and to make sure our children know how to store them has felt a little less of a romantic folly as the past two years have unfolded. Every month we spot another sign that society has been busy shrugging off skills only to realise we needed them after all.“The hungry gap” is one phrase that has fallen out of common use too quickly despite the gap between those who have enough to eat and those who don’t widening in recent years. I learned it while reading John Seymour’s 1961 self-sufficiency classic, The Fat of the Land. The gap begins at the moment each year when winter stores have run low, before spring crops are ready its length is dependent on the success of harvests and spring weather. Our ancestors would have planned around it and sometimes suffered through it. With supermarkets and imported food (which our family still relies on), we have swiftly forgotten about it, but we might need the hungry gap in our consciousness once again as it coincides so exactly with Britain’s planned EU exit.Emma Baylis keeps an allotment with 20 chickens in Warwickshire and works as a barber. Chatting to a broad cross-section of her community is part of her job and she is concerned that we have become too complacent and disconnected from our food supply. “I don’t think the majority of people even think of where food comes from,” she says. Baylis is considering whether to kill some of her surplus poultry for meat for the first time our family is having similar discussions. It’s a battle between how fond we are of the animals and a growing sense that we should only eat meat that we can be certain has a high-welfare provenance. We talked with the children and came to a compromise that we won’t eat the geese or ducks, but will breed from them next year to supply our own freezer. Five young cockerels’ fates still hangs in the balance. I’m hoping this Brexit jumble is worked out before their meat starts to toughen.In 2016 the gardening writer and broadcaster Monty Don poured scorn on the middle England pursuit of self-sufficiency, stating it is “inevitably doomed to humiliating failure” and is a path towards madness. He’s probably right. For most of us, true self-sufficiency is impossible and unnecessary. I cannot grow enough food for my family without it being a full-time job. Even then there would likely be periods of the year when we would be hungry or have only increasingly shrivelled turnips to eat. Should a Brexit disaster interrupt our national food supply or drive the electricity prices into orbit, we might have, at best, a week’s advantage on everyone else – probably less, now I have talked about our potato store in a national newspaper.Yet I also agree with Don that seeking to provide some of your own food and energy – what he calls “self-provision” – is pleasurable and worthwhile. After all, there doesn’t have to be a survival motivation to growing. The quality of produce, the chance to eat something that has ripened on the tree, bush or vine, or to watch your children shell and gobble peas like Maltesers is enough. Being outside and feeling the impact of the change of seasons, noticing the first day you break the ice on the animals’ water buckets or seeing the shimmering haze of spring on the cobnut trees connects me to the world and acts as a shield against the anxieties of modern life.Underneath that, though, I believe that many of us who share a love for growing our own food are undertaking a less extreme version of “prepping”. We might not have nuclear bunkers or 10 years’ worth of canned goods, but we are driven by a human need to know we can rely on our own means and pass this to our children – which is made sharper in times of crisis. I suspect and hope I will never need to radically scale up production of food from my garden and animal sheds, but I will know how to if the time comes.More than that, in the face of uncertainty and turmoil, I feel, perhaps irrationally, more powerful when I bite into an apple, crack an egg or roast a parsnip that I planned, worked for and harvested. Sometimes we all need to feel a little powerful, just for a moment, in this very confusing world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

Yet neither Jeremy Corbyn nor Theresa May supports this route.”As it stands, the plan is for May and Corbyn to line up against each other on BBC1 on Sunday evening, two days before the crunch vote in the Commons on the planned Brexit deal.However, there is still quibbling between the two sides over the format, and whether it could instead be broadcast on ITV.A Downing Street spokesman said that in the week since May challenged Corbyn to a debate, “in order to accommodate his confected demands we’ve moved our preferred day, accommodated the addition of social media questions at Labour’s request, and agreed there should be maximum head-to-head time, while still including voices from employers and civil society in the debate”.The spokesman added: “But if Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t agree to what’s now on the table – a debate on primetime with the prime minister – the public will rightly conclude he’s running scared. So let’s get on with it.”However, a Labour spokeswoman said May was “running away from the scrutiny of a real head to head debate with Jeremy Corbyn”, as she had in the 2017 election.“Why else would she not accept ITV’s offer of a straightforward head-to-head debate, as Jeremy has done?” she said. “Instead, her team are playing games and prefer the BBC’s offer, which would provide less debating time and risk a confusing mish-mash for the viewing public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/518b5cc72d7d13c8cdadcd968c4d701b53523d82/0_341_5433_3261/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a82287731f262c5cc7f251fc8430450","title":"did you solve it an aboriginal family puzzle","story":"The solution to today’s puzzleEarlier today I set you the following puzzle: Aboriginal groups are ided into subgroups, called “skins.” Your skin is determined at birth, based on your parents’ skins, and it does not change in your lifetime. Your skin will determine certain social rules, such as who you are allowed to marry.The Warlpiri, who live northwest of Alice Springs, ide themselves into eight skins, according to the rules in the diagram below. Yes, it’s complicated! The skins are numbered 1 to 8. The horizontal rows indicate marriage correspondences, while the arrows point from mother to child. (All the marriages here are between men and women, and we can assume no orces or half-siblings or step children.).So, if your skin is 1, you must marry someone with a skin of 5, and vice versa, since both these skins are on the same horizontal line. If your skin is 2, you must marry a 6, and vice versa.Similarly, if you are a female with skin 1, your children will be skin 4. If you are a female with skin 4, your children will be skin 2, and so on, following the arrows around.For skin 1, males are Jakamarra, and females are Nakamarra. Likewise, the names of the other skins always begin with a J for men, and the J is replaced with an N for the women. (Except Jupurrula, which becomes Napurrula.) I’m not making any of this up, by the way.Now imagine you go into a Warlpiri village and speak to six people about their family relations. Based on these responses, can you determine the female name for each of the skins?(iii) “I am a Nampijinpa. My mother’s grandfathers were Jungarrayi and Jupurrula.”(v) “I am a Napanangka. Some of my good friends are Napaljarri and Nangala and Nungarrayi. Oh, you wanted me to talk about my family? Oops.”(vi) “I am a Japanangka.

I know my family tree very well.”The female names for the skins are: 1. Nakamarra, 2. Nampijinpa, 3. Napanangka, 4. Nungarrayi, 5. Napaljarri, 6. Napangardi, 7. Napurrula, 8. Nangala.Let’s first get the hang of how to use the diagram.STEP 1. We know Nakamarra is 1 ,so let’s start with sentence (ii). And let’s break it down. It is saying: If I am 1, then if you apply the rule for brother, then the rule for father to child, you get Jupurulla.1 \u0026gt 1 \u0026gt 7  Jupurulla. Skin 7 is Jupurulla for men, and thus Napurrula for women.STEP 2. With knowledge that Napurrula is 7, let’s go to (iv). It is saying:But we can go the other way too:STEP 3 Let’s now look at the daunting statement (vi). If you look closely it is repeating the phrase ‘wife’s father’s mother’s brother’ several times. This is the relation:H2W \u0026gt C2F \u0026gt C2M \u0026gt SIB, which simplifies asH2W \u0026gt C2M \u0026gt W2H \u0026gt C2M, which you may notice always takes you back to where you started! (Due to the symmetries of the arrows). So we can ignore all appearances of “wife’s father’s mother’s brother” and are left withJapanangka \u0026gt H2W \u0026gt 7. So Japanangka is 3 (male), so the 3 (female) is Napanangka.STEP 4 Now to statement (iii). The issue here is that we have two types of grandfather (maternal and paternal) and we dont know which one is Jungarrayi and which one is Jupurrula (7).By working out the possibilities we see that if 7 is the (mother’s) paternal grandfather, then Nampijinpa is a 6, which is already taken. So 7 must be the (mother’s) maternal grandfather, and thus Nampijinpa is 2 and Nungarrayi is a 4.STEP 5. It’s all coming together. From (i) Jangala must be male skin 8, so Nangala is female skin 8. Leaving Napaljarri as the 5.Extra points if you spotted that the kinship system is D4, the dihedral group of order 8, which is the group of symmetries of a square. (Going from husband to wife or vice versa is like flipping the square over, and going through the four skins 1-4-2-3-1, or 5-7-6-9-5 is like rotating the square 90 degrees each time.)I hope you enjoyed the puzzle.

This one, first seen in the West End in 1940 and later filmed with Barbara Mullen and Michael Redgrave, is a slender fairytale by the forgotten Scottish playwright Aimée Stuart and is chiefly remarkable for a heroine who combines a dogged resilience with a romantic soul. It’s a peach of a part into which Mairi Hawthorn, only recently out of drama school, gratefully sinks her teeth.Jeannie starts out as a drudge for a tyrannical father but, when she comes into an inheritance of £200, decides to blow it on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Vienna where she is befriended by Stanley, a washing-machine inventor from Yorkshire. Their paths erge when Jeannie is beguiled by a parasitic Austrian count and Stanley by a svelte blond mannequin. The outcome is predictable: Stuart relies heavily on the assumption that foreigners are untrustworthy and I found myself wondering whether a penny-wise Scot like Jeannie would be quite so carefree with her cash.The piece is, however, elegantly staged by Nicolette Kay with a set by James Helps that shifts easily from a Scottish stone kitchen to a luxurious continental hotel. Hawthorn also captures exactly Jeannie’s mix of inbred puritanism and latent hedonism. Fiercely clutching her umbrella as if to ward off advances, she tells Stanley: “We never speak about sex in Scotland.” At the same time, under the influence of Strauss waltzes and flattery from the aristocratic smoothie, she blossoms into a figure rather like Eliza Doolittle preparing to go to the ball.Even if the play belongs to her, there is good support from Matthew Mellalieu who lends the Yorkshireman a Priestley-like stolidity, Patrick Pearson as the silver-haired count and Madeleine Hutchins as the silky fashion model. You can see why the play was popular in 1940 in that it offered an escape from reality and evoked a lost European lifestyle. Today, although dashingly directed and blessed with the sound of Jack Buchanan reedily singing Goodnight Vienna, it looks a trifle musty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d47e7588a4414888f26faae8809518245196a9/58_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3a3c2309359e47f300721197e8c9aa","title":"forbes seven year old youtuber ryan toys review made 17m in one year","story":"US toy reviewer Ryan beat UK’s Daniel Middleton to the top spot for highest earningsAn American seven-year-old boy who reviews toys has topped a list of the highest-earning YouTube stars after making £17.2m.Ryan, from Ryan ToysReview, made the hefty sum for his online reviews between June 2017 and June 2018.Since launching his main channel in 2015, Ryan has amassed more than 17 million followers and close to 26bn views.Online sensation Jake Paul was second on Forbes’ list, with £16.8m.

As a result adult material has flooded the service, where it sits alongside other fandoms for everything from Harry Potter to anime.However, attempts to provide a “safe mode” for younger users have sometimes caused problems. Last month the Tumblr app was removed from Apple’s app store after its filtering system inadvertently allowed some child pornography to appear on the social network.Tumblr’s chief executive, Jeff D’Onofrio, said that as the site has grown, its responsibilities to “different age groups, demographics, cultures, and mindsets” have increased and it has now decided to remove all adult material from 17 December.“We spent considerable time weighing the pros and cons of expression in the community that includes adult content. In doing so, it became clear that without this content we have the opportunity to create a place where more people feel comfortable expressing themselves,” he said.“Bottom line: There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community.”Tumblr said all content including photos, videos or gifs that “show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples” would be banned, alongside any content that depicts sex acts. The site insisted that it would still allow non-sexualised images of women’s nipples, in situations such as breastfeeding or works of art.Websites such as Tumblr were founded in a different internet era when the focus was on the right to publish material. They are increasingly having to rethink their policies after years of criticism for being too permissive and having weak moderation, with major companies increasingly concerned about the content their adverts are appearing alongside.The decision also reflects challenges at Oath, the media business which owns Tumblr in addition to many former assets of Yahoo and AOL such as the Huffington Post.Oath was founded in a bid to build an online media business that had sufficient scale to challenge Facebook and Google for advertising revenue, but has recently seen the departure of chief executive Tim Armstrong, with its parent company, the US telecoms firm Verizon, taking a closer interest in its activities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92033cd1bfd70f89cd0ea5a2eb61fc5b62d6abf2/0_0_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dd562203111051eb89bc3fd4e3e08f","title":"five wheelie good cycling and hiking routes in thuringia","story":"From mountain peaks to Unesco-listed woodlands, castles and medieval villages, the German region boasts some of Europe’s most dramatic and enchanting landscapes1 The Rennsteig – Germany’s oldest hiking trailThuringia’s most famous hiking path is steeped in tradition, and known across Europe for its superb scenery. Hundreds of historic boundary stones – the symbol of the Rennsteig – mark the route and tell their own story about how this path was for years a border between the Franconian and Thuringian provinces.The 105-mile route winds down from the town of Eisenach (home of Wartburg Castle), via Suhl, and ends at Blankenstein, right on the current border between Thuringia and Bavaria. Today, there’s also a 120-mile cycle path that runs almost parallel to the walking route, but with longer deviations to avoid too many buttock-bashing hill climbs. But while the cycle path is still a teenager, the classic hiking route is nearly 700 years old. You can sense the souls that have trodden this famous path over the years, along the historic ridgeline above the forests. Some 100,000 walkers come every year to explore this evocative slice of countryside. And deep below your feet a plethora of tunnels carry some of Germany’s most important road and rail routes – including the tubes carrying the brand new Erfurt to Nuremberg high-speed railway.2 The Hochrhoener trail Parts of the Hochrhoener trail extend into Hesse and Bavaria, but its heart lies in Thuringia. Running from Bad Kissingen to Bad Salzungen, via Kreuzberg and the Wasserkuppe mountain, the Hochrhoener trail snakes for 87 miles. It is split into nine stages, if you only want to walk a portion of the longer trail, and crests out at an impressive 876 metres. And if you still feel like you want to go higher, the Hochrhoener is the perfect place for gliding in Thuringia. If you gaze skywards from the paths you can often see gliders catching the currents, which are perfect here due to the geography of the mountains and the way the weather systems work their way through the area. Stargazers can veer off the main path on the Geba trail to discover the “Sternenpark” or Star Park – one of Europe’s leading dark sky landscapes. With platforms and viewing devices provided, it is ideal for gazing into space and spotting stars and planets. And for a taste of history, you can explore the Point Alpha trail leading to the Point Alpha military installations and the remains of the former inner German border – the iron curtain. In this area on the border there’s also Merkers mine – a former salt mine, where the Nazis stashed treasures during the second world war.3 The Thuringian Chain-of-Towns – long-distance cycle trailArchitecture aficionados will love this journey through the buildings and history of Thuringia’s main urban centres. The Chain-of-Towns trail runs for a total of 140 miles, but most of that is over flat to gently sloping ground – so the going is not like pulling teeth. And the route is also perhaps best enjoyed in small portions. Electric bikes are encouraged and regular charging stations pepper the route, plus there are a slew of DB (Deutsche Bahn) railway stations along the way, where you can let the train take the strain if you don’t want to cycle the whole thing. The Chain-of-Towns trail begins in Eisenach, home to the Unesco world heritage site, Wartburg Castle. Next, Gotha and its castle Schloss Friedenstein. Cosmopolitan Erfurt’s student population ensures plenty of bars, and its handsome, historic centre is home to such architectural highlights as the Old Synagogue – one of Europe’s oldest, which is itself home to the famous Erfurt Treasure of gold and silver. Then it’s on to historic Weimar and Jena, and then to Altenburg, where the route concludes.4 Saale cycle route – hills aplentyThose double-wheeled daredevils who look in awe at the Tour de France’s King of the Mountains exploits can find their cycling satisfaction on this challenging and ultimately rewarding run through the heart of the Thuringian hills following the River Saale. Coming in at a thigh-chafing 250 miles, the Saale cycle route calls for plenty of Vaseline in the panniers. The first part of the route from picturesque Fichtelgebirge through the high hills is the most spectacular, and tea breaks can be taken while you marvel at gorges or pristine lakes. As the river widens and flattens, castles and vineyards become more common sights. Bad Sulza’s wineries are especially noted for their bottles of Grüner Veltliner or Muscat Ottonel. Reaching Saalfeld, cyclists or walkers find the mesmerising Fairy Grottoes, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most colourful caves. Then, finally, you find peaceful meadows before the river joins the Elbe and flows on its long journey up to Hamburg and the North Sea. Jena is one of Thuringia’s main towns and provides plenty of sleeping, eating and shopping options. Optical innovator Zeiss was founded here and the town’s Zeiss Planetarium is rightly known for its audio and video shows.5 Schwarza Valley Panorama trail – for tree loversFans of forests can revel in this peaceful adventure through the trees that sprout on the eastern side of the Thuringian forest nature park. The park is packed with dense thickets of coniferous trees that provide a habitat for a huge variety of bird and animal species, and you can even forage for wild mushrooms and garlic. This 84-mile trail follows a loop route, starting and finishing in pretty Rudolstadt. Along the way, the trail passes various picture-postcard villages and towns such as Bad Blankenburg, Meuselbach, Altenfeld and Cordobang. The path sometimes rises out from the forest and up into the foothills of the Thuringian Schiefergebirge mountains – whose height and scenic value give the Saxon Switzerland hills, or even the Bavarian mountains, a run for their money. Aside from the obvious arboreal attractions, the Schwarza Valley Panorama trail also passes near to several castles perched on the banks of the River Saale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd65faa3b93e5c08509382c208d06bddb43ec1a/0_1_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe53e88f6e4e7958eddd3c5d549856e","title":"from chocolate to beef roulade the culinary delights of thuringia","story":"The German region may be known for its castles, jaw-dropping landscapes and the famous faces who lived there, but its culinary scene is also something to check out when you visitGerman food is just sausages, isn’t it, and sauerkraut? Well, yes, they do have 1,200 types of wurst – but this is a country with a huge ersity of cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. With more than 200 types of bread, a nationwide passion for vegetables, and an infinite range of regional styles, served everywhere from rural inns to the country’s 300-plus Michelin-starred restaurants, Germany is arguably home to some of the most underrated cuisine in Europe. And the culinary scene in Thuringia is well worth shouting about.So if the state’s erse history, from Martin Luther and Goethe to the Weimar Republic, and spectacularly bucolic landscape, aren’t enough to keep you occupied, Thuringia’s terrific cuisine will certainly ert the attention. A mustard museum in Erfurt and the annual Onion Festival in Weimar (with live music and food stalls, it attracts more than 350,000 people yearly) are proof of how seriously they take their food.The Thuringian bratwurst is the culinary kingpin of the region, but you can tuck in to other hearty dishes such as the succulent Mutzbraten (grilled pork) and Thuringian dumplings, or for those with a sweeter tooth, how about some handmade chocolate? And why not wash it all down with a dark beer, for which the region is well known, or a glass of white wine from Bad Sulza in north-eastern Thuringia? Just a few more reasons why Thuringia should be firmly on the tourist map.Thuringian bratwurstLocals claim the Thuringer rostbratwurst – its full name – is the best bratwurst in Germany. The original recipe dates back to 1434, so they certainly know what they are doing. Consisting of minced pork (local variations have beef or game) mixed with marjoram and garlic, some also feature caraway seed, although its inclusion is a subject of hot debate among Thuringians. It’s traditionally grilled over an open fire and eaten on the street with a bun and mustard (ketchup is a definite faux pas), but having it with sauerkraut and potatoes is also common. Locals consume nearly three times as many bratwursts a year than the average German.Try one from a street stall, or Faust Food, an indoor food market. Still pining for sausages? Then head to the Eichsfeld region in western Thuringia for three types of air-dried sausage: runde, feldkieker (which looks a bit like a club), or the spicy stracke, and you can sample them at the Klausenhof tavern in Bornhagen.Thuringer klösseThe dumpling is a staple dish of the region and traditionally served with a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Filling and wholesome, the local dumpling doesn’t contain flour and is made of raw grated potatoes and cooked mashed potatoes, seasoned, rolled into fist-sized balls with two or three croutons stuffed inside and then simmered in water. They go well with meat or veg, and were originally popular with the less well-off as they were cheap to make. Try them at Die Landgrafenstube Wartburg Hotel in Eisenach or, for a cheaper alternative, head to Zum Guldenen Rade in Erfurt.MutzbratenA tasty chunk of seasoned pork, which is flame grilled – traditionally over a birchwood fire. It’s served with bread, sauerkraut and mustard. Try one in Schmölln or Altenburg, in the eastern part of the state, where it is something of a speciality, or in an inn or restaurant while walking in the Thuringian Forest.Goldhelm chocolate Inspired chocolate creations are what you will find at Goldhelm Schokolade, which has two outlets in Erfurt. There’s a tiny shop on Krämerbrücke (Merchants’ Bridge), the longest inhabited bridge in Europe – it dates from the 14th century – or there’s a larger version with a lovely cafe on nearby Kreuzgasse. Using high-grade cocoa from Peru and Vietnam allows the makers to lower the sugar content. Their signature chocolate is the Bridge Truffle. They do a memorable hot chocolate too.Beers, wines and spiritsThuringia has a long tradition of brewing beer and producing wine: in the middle ages there were nearly 600 breweries in Erfurt, Germany’s oldest beer purity law was laid down in Weissensee in 1434. The region is known for its dark beers, one of the best is Köstrizter from the little town of Köstritz. Most towns have their own breweries, such as those in Weimar, Eisenach and Erfurt (head here to the Goldener Schwan, which has a wide variety of beers, including wheat and pilsner). Hikers in the Thuringian Forest should visit the Ankerla Brewery in Steinach.Oenophiles will find some fabulous white wines, too – and some very good reds – around Bad Sulza in the north-east one of the best vineyards is Weingut Zahn in Grossheringen, which has a restaurant and tours.And don’t forget to try Thuringia’s range of digestifs, or kräuterschnaps. You will find them in most bars and restaurants – look out for Aromatique, made in Neudietendorf, using spices and herbs Rhöntropfen, produced since the 1870s in the Rhön region and also made with herbs and spices, and Nordhäuser Doppelkorn, a grain brandy from Nordhausen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9425f5b81f3dc73a33d4d83278462aaa4181fd7c/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbed519ba607a04b1c62249fb1af8ea","title":"fairytale castles and secret forests discover germanys best kept secret","story":"Deep in the heart of Germany lies Thuringia – a state bursting with both cultural curiosities and unrivalled natural beautyExplore the wildernessThe 700-year-old Rennsteig trail traces a spectacular ridgeway through the Thuringian forest, and is a mecca for hikers and cyclists.

With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena. The world’s oldest planetarium, built in 1926, features an impressive dome projection system where Pink Floyd and Queen provide the soundtrack to gas clouds and galaxies. And for holiday snaps unlike anyone else’s Instagram feed, visit Erfurt-Rieth: a concrete jungle of 1970s GDR architecture, complete with retro-futurist skywalks, plattenbau tower blocks, murals and sculptures.The best of the wurstIt would be remiss not to mention Thuringia’s legendary sausages – rostbratwursts, or “rosters” – which are one of the world’s most delicious things to put on a BBQ, slather in mustard and slap into a sliced roll. The marjoram and spices in these protected-designation-of-origin sausages bring them to life. Satisfy your sweet tooth with a slice of sheet cake topped with plums and crumble, or indulge in handmade chocolates from the Goldhelm workshop in Erfurt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a4d23b99b165a997b6f9a4b3cefcfbfb724e19c/0_56_2296_1377/master/2296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61bbb349039847da18e4d02e14ab37f0","title":"mexico amlo president andres manuel lopez obrador","story":"Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as Amlo, signalled new openness by briefing reporters and ditching heavy securityMexico’s newly inaugurated president has hit the ground running, with his pledge to govern as a common man and end decades of secrecy, heavy security and luxury enjoyed by past presidents.Andrés Manuel López Obrador sported slightly ruffled hair at his first early morning news conference as president on Monday, which started at 7am local time.“Isn’t that a change, that I am here, informing you?” López Obrador asked reporters. While past presidents have very seldom held news conferences, López Obrador promised to do so on a near-daily basis, much as he did when he was mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005.López Obrador, known as Amlo, took his first airplane flight as president on Sunday, boarding a commercial aircraft with the rest of the passengers. He has promised to sell the presidential jet as an austerity measure.López Obrador arrived at Mexico City’s National Palace in the same white compact car he used before taking office on Saturday. López Obrador refused the military bodyguards used by past presidents and travels with a small staff of aides who provide security. He usually travels tourist class.“I feel safe, protected and supported by the Mexican people,” López Obrador said.He also claimed that the number of murders had declined on Saturday and Sunday, his first two days in office.In the first 10 months of 2018, homicides in Mexico have run at an average of just over 80 per day.But López Obrador said the average over the weekend was about 50, according to initial reports. He cautioned that those totals are preliminary and still under review.The president and his staff said necessary work would continue to safeguard the foundations already built at the proposed new Mexico City airport project he plans to cancel in favor of expanding existing airports.Officials have not determined what will be done with the vast foundations built on a former lakebed known as Texcoco. But some further work is needed to keep the slabs from decaying or sinking.López Obrador has promised to protect investors who bought bonds to fund the construction, but on Monday the airport fund issued an auction offer to repurchase $6bn worth of the bonds at a price of 90 cents to $1 on the dollar of principal amounts, suggesting some bondholders may take a haircut."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a58da484fa1f01708e4e57c2d026793655dba01e/45_0_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82e180fcbae89c534c0ba78c3cd3885d","title":"who are the gilets jaunes and what do they want","story":"What began as a fuel tax protest by French drivers now appeals to wider anti-government sentiment A grassroots citizens’ protest movement began in early November against a planned rise in the tax on diesel and petrol, which Emmanuel Macron insisted would aid the country’s transition to green energy. A poll at the time found that the price of fuel had become France’s biggest talking point.The movement was named “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) because protesters wear the fluorescent yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. But what began as a fuel tax protest has now morphed into a wider anti-government movement.Unlike previous French protest movements, it sprang up online through petitions and was organised by ordinary working people posting videos on social media, without a set leader, trade union or political party behind it.A first national day of protests was held across France on Saturday 17 November and the protests have continued daily, including roadblocks, barricades of roundabouts and the blockading of fuel depots.The French interior ministry says the total number of people demonstrating has dropped since its peak on 17 November, when about 285,000 people demonstrated across France. On 1 December, two weeks after the first protests, the interior ministry said that at 3pm 75,000 people were on the streets. It is thought that about 100,000 in total demonstrated in France throughout the day.However, violence has escalated at the weekly Paris protests held on Saturdays. While thousands demonstrated peacefully on 1 December, about 3,000 people fought running battles with police, burned more than 100 cars, set fire to several buildings and smashed bank windows and shopfronts on some of the most expensive streets in the capital.Authorities blamed extreme-right and extreme-left “professional” rioters for infiltrating the peaceful demonstrations. The Paris prosecutor said a majority of the more than 300 people in police custody after the Paris violence were men aged between 30 and 40 who “had come to fight police while also claiming to be part of the gilets jaunes movement”.There were also violent clashes with police in Toulouse. In Le Puy-en-Velay, the local prefect’s office was petrol-bombed and briefly caught fire.Gilets jaunes protesters in other regions continue to stage roadblocks, and some fuel depots have been blocked in the north-west. Some high-school students have also now joined the movement and barricaded schools.Protesters have largely come from peripheral towns, cities and rural areas across France and include many women and single mothers. Most of the protesters have jobs, including as secretaries, IT workers, factory workers, delivery workers and care workers. All say their low incomes mean they cannot make ends meet at the end of the month.The movement is predominantly against a tax system perceived as unfair and unjust, but there are numerous grievances and differences of opinion. Most want to scrap the fuel taxes, hold a review of the tax system, raise the minimum wage and roll back Macron’s tax cuts for the wealthy and his pro-business economic programme. But some also want parliament dissolved and Macron to resign.This is the first big crisis of Macron’s presidency. The 40-year-old pro-business, pro-Europe centrist has staked his political identity on insisting he would never give in to street protests. But polls suggest he is seen as not listening to the concerns of ordinary working people on low incomes, and he is under pressure to make concessions.It is damaging that Macron – whose own fledgling political movement, La République En Marche, was styled as a grassroots movement to listen to the people – was taken by surprise by this sudden tax revolt. Although Macron beat the far-right Marine Le Pen in last year’s presidential election, the mood of distrust of the political class never went away.The question is what Macron could now offer to calm the protests and whether he now tweaks his economic policy. The first 18 months of Macron’s presidency were defined by his drive for businesses to become more competitive he has cut taxes on companies and transformed France’s wealth tax, easing the tax burden on the very wealthy.Macron is now under pressure to consider the gilets jaunes’ demands, which include scrapping the eco tax and raising the minimum wage. It is uncertain what measures the government might propose in the coming days. The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Monday that the government should press on with lowering taxes but at the same time lower France’s high public spending.AnalysisWarnings of latest crisis facing Macron were in plain sightAre the French hit especially hard by fuel taxes?OpinionNever before have I seen blind anger like this on the streets of ParisFrance is deeply fractured.

The decision to cancel classes came after teachers at the school discovered on Friday they had not been paid for their previous month’s work. Anxious chatter, mostly in Portuguese among Brazilian students, wafted across the Grand Canal as a group of teachers met with representatives from Marketing English in Ireland (MEI) on Monday, the main umbrella organisation for English language schools across the State. Martin Brennan, who has taught at the school for nearly two years, stood by the main entrance to the school, fielding questions from confused and frustrated students. Like many of the 23 teachers at the school, he has small children at home and bills to pay. “Four weeks from Christmas, we’ve lost our jobs and to rub salt in the wound there’s been no communication from the college,” Mr Brennan told The . “It’s very difficult to take, especially this time of year. There was a meeting here last night but no concrete questions were answered.”He said the situation was also difficult for students who had been left “completely rudderless” after paying substantial fees for classes. “The situation is people are coming here to make a better life, to learn English so it improves their chances of getting a job and now they’re being told ‘you’re out’, basically.”Anna Duca, who moved to Ireland from Sao Paulo in 2017, had already encountered difficulties with the administration at the college when trying to confirm her study visa. She said teachers also struggled with the internal administration system. “My visa was denied two times because of mistakes made by administration. They didn’t send the school attendance letter and sent the insurance letter with the wrong details.”The 27-year-old student paid €1,600 for eight months of English classes but says most students pay well over €2,000. More than 90 per cent of the students are Brazilian with others from Mongolia, Mexico, Colombia and Russia, Ms Duca said.Like many other students, Ms Duca was confused by a message posted by Grafton College on Instagram on Sunday which relayed its disappointment at the situation but failed to provide an explanation to students. The message, which was posted to the @graftoncollegedublin account by a person called ‘Anna’, wrote: “I hope we all get the respect we deserve tomorrow and in the long run because the outcome of all our hard work, in this instance, is clearly unfair and unjust.”A subsequent comment under the post advised students to attend school as normal on Monday. “You will get all the information tomorrow.” It is understood the lease on the building occupied by Grafton College was coming to an end in the new year, and there were plans for it to relocate. However, there were no indications of any financial difficulties or imminent closure. Management and representative groups have been unable to make contact with the London-based owner of the school since Friday. There are around two weeks left of the term before the Christmas break and up to 500 students attending the school.Roy Hassey, union organiser with Unite has made representations to Minister for Education Joe McHugh and the Oireachtas education committee urging more stringent regulation of the private English language teaching sector.“This sector has been blighted over the last five or 10 years with this sort of situation, with schools closing down overnight, students left without anywhere to go, teachers left out of pocket,” he said.The international English language teaching market is worth an estimated €762 million to the Irish economy, according to the Department of Education. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance Bill, legislation drawn up to deal with its regulation, is currently before the Oireachtas."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718628.1543854717!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teacher learnt of college closure on his wedding day","story":"Robert Dunlop got married on Saturday only to find out he lost his job on Monday, his wife Gisela is due with their first child on the 27th of December.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRobert Dunlop and his wife Gisela after their wedding on Saturday in Dublin. Photograph: Courtessy of Robert DunlopHaving exchanged wedding vows with his partner Gisela at the Unitarian Church on Dublin’s St Stephen’s Green on Saturday, Robert Dunlop noticed dozens of new messages showing up on his phone.Assuming that they were from family and friends who could not attend the wedding rather than anything work-related, he took a moment to scan them.The contents were far from the well wishes for the life ahead of them — the couple are also expecting their first child later this month — it was a bleak stream of panicked texts from his fellow teachers at Grafton College, who found out they had not been paid a day earlier and were, in all likelihood, out of work.“Then we walked across the Green to a little French restaurant Chez Max on Baggot Street, and we had our reception there,” Dunlop says. “I was trying to ignore it all and not pay attention to the reality. It was tough. But it is really hitting home now.”The 33-year-old English teacher, who is from Stepaside but lives in Portobello, close to where he has been teaching overseas language students since April, said he does not know how he and Gisela will get through the run-up to Christmas and the imminent arrival of their baby.Rather than returning to his classes on Monday, Dunlop was going to check what welfare payments he was entitled to before the hunt for a new job got underway.“But obviously there is going to be lots of competition, because all the teachers here are going to be looking for work,” he says.While all 23 teachers and five administrative staff were told they would not be getting their salaries from November — due to be paid last Friday — Dunlop expects he could be left out of pocket on the double.“I was saving last month’s paycheck for after the wedding, so I wouldn’t dip into it,” he says. “I’ll be trying to cash it now, but it is in the lap of the gods as to whether it comes in. If not, I’m two months out of pay.”Dunlop says he is struggling to get his head around the situation he and his new wife now find themselves in, despite being “as frugal as possible” with their wedding planning.“All the savings we could have made is nothing compared to the two months of pay,” he says. “I still haven’t processed it. I can’t even bring myself to think about the financial implications yet.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3717744.1543781192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"as poland hosts climate talks paris agreement looks frayed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS federal regulatory rollbacks have increased the attractiveness of investing in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects globally, while the US withdrawal from the agreement “has created moral and political cover for others to follow suit”Three years after the Paris agreement on climate change was agreed, the annual gathering of 195 signatory countries was scheduled to finalise a rulebook for delivery and to push on with implementation. The framework is the annual conference of the parties known as the COP in this case COP24 in Katowice, Poland, which opens on Monday. Governments in climate denial – under-delivery from the committed, and chilling scientific reports confirming the scale of damage to the planet from climate change– have diffused optimism. The recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report demonstrated the vulnerabilities, impacts and risks of further global warming. This is against a background of record global temperatures, rising emissions, accelerating extreme weather events and time running out to stave off worst-case scenarios.Parties are likely to agree on rules under the agreement the US excluded. This relates not only to promises by inidual states set for 2025 and 2030, but also long-term goals.The view that US president Donald Trump’s distinct brand of climate denial can be circumvented by the actions of committed US states and corporations is, however, countered by Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) analysis published on Monday which finds the “Trump effect” is slowing down the pace of global decarbonisation.Its author, IIEA research fellow Joseph Curtin, warns against downplaying the very real damage caused by it, but also against prematurely drawing defeatist conclusions about the future of the agreement. “While the agreement may be taking on water, it is a mistake to suggest that it is about to sink, or that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments,” he said. “The agreement can resist the Trump effect – it was designed to be resilient – but in the medium and longer-term it will be weakened unless the factors underpinning President Trump’s decision can be addressed in the US.” US federal regulatory rollbacks have increased the attractiveness of investing in the dirtiest fossil fuel projects globally, while the US withdrawal from the agreement “has created moral and political cover for others to follow suit”, it adds. Russia and Turkey have abandoned plans to ratify, while Australia has rolled back measures to comply with the agreement. Brazil was due to host COP25 next year but pulled out in recent days, which is being interpreted as a sign of president-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s impending war against climate action. US withdrawal has also severely damaged goodwill at international negotiations, “a vital ingredient for future progress”, the IIEA concludes. It was hoped national efforts to meet Paris pledges would catalyse faster deployment of green technologies, leading to economies of scale, reduced technology costs and positive spillovers all countries could benefit from. “This was supposed to open up space for parties to take on increasingly robust commitments every five years,” Curtin adds.Denying the importance of the Trump effect is a mistake, the report concludes, “but it is also a mistake to suggest the agreement is in crisis, or worse still, that all parties are failing to live up to their commitments”. The EU is determined to ramp up ambition and to be seen as the global leader in climate change. It has unveiled its plan to be the first major economy to go “climate neutral” by 2050 – which means any greenhouse gases emitted need to be soaked up by forest growth or new technologies removing carbon from the atmosphere. Combustion engine vehicles are to be phased out and fossil fuels cut to zero. Decarbonisation targets will be much more demanding and reliance on technological solutions more pronounced through “negative emissions” technology – essentially use of bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).This amounts to an attempt to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. It comes with recommendations rather than targets, but it is clear the plan will be a big part of the COP24 agenda. Critically for Ireland, it flags more onerous targets when the country is locked into a rising emissions trajectory. In spite of a raft of policy measures adopted to address this, next week’s Climate Change Performance Index is likely to confirm our laggard status. The EU approach “makes sense for now”, according to Erica Hope of the European Climate Foundation. Big things need to happen, she said in Dublin recently. But with uncertainty and lack of common purpose, she couldn’t help thinking of Brexit. The backdrop is “real world progress is not where it needs to be. There is clearly an emissions gap”.A core of EU countries, notably Sweden, Portugal and Denmark, strongly favour scaled-up ambition. Ireland may have flagged greater ambition but performance does not tally with that. Others with coal or diesel emissions issues regard climate action as a nuisance. Action Aid has spelt out COP24 requirements from a climate justice perspective. Rich countries must deliver on a promised $100 billion per year for climate action in poorer countries as keeping to 1.5 degrees can only be achieved through countries delivering their fair share of reductions in national emissions. “Rich countries have done most to cause climate change, yet currently poor countries are doing more than rich countries to reduce their own national-level emissions.” it added. It feared BECCs would require so much land to grow tree plantations for bioenergy it would lead to widespread hunger and deforestation. “And the fact is that this process is not even carbon neutral. It will not halt the rise in global warming.”Those concerned about lack of concrete actions at a time of great urgency hope the “Talanoa Dialogue” adopted at COP23 will compel countries to come forward with pledges to ambitiously increase current mitigation and finance targets, and communicate such improvements by 2020 thus sending a signal to other states to accelerate climate action in spite of patchy progress so far."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718590.1543854204!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"david attenborough mass extinction is on the horizon","story":"World renowned naturalist, Sir David Attenborough, has told a UN climate change conference that the continuation of civilisations and of the natural world is in the hands of world leaders. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British naturalist Sir David Attenborough at the COP24 summit in Katowice, Poland: “The world’s people have spoken, their message is clear, time is running out, they want you, the decision-makers, to act now.” Photograph: Andrzej GrygielEPAThe collapse of civilisation and extinction of much of the natural world is “on the horizon” due to climate change, Sir David Attenborough declared at the opening day UN climate talks in Poland. The naturalist and TV presenter called on global leaders and decision-makers, who have gathered in Katowice for the COP24 conference, to take charge on driving down greenhouse gas emissions as climate change was the greatest threat facing the world “in thousands of years”.“The world’s people have spoken, their message is clear, time is running out, they want you, the decision-makers, to act now. They’re supporting you in making tough decisions but they’re also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives,” he added.“The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands.”Sir David was speaking on behalf of the UN’s “People’s Seat” initiative to give ordinary people a voice at the international talks by gathering their thoughts, ideas and concerns through social media.He endorsed the “ActNow.bot” which helps people discover simple everyday actions they can take to tackle climate change.“The people have spoken: leaders of the world, you must lead, the continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend are in your hands,” he added.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned negotiators at the meeting that the world was in deep trouble. “Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later, before it’s too late. For many people, regions and even countries, this is already a matter of life and death,” he said.Climate action was not just the right thing to do, it made social and economic sense, Mr Guterres said, pointing to how action to cut emissions would curb air pollution deaths, generate millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.Mr Guterres said he had four simple messages:Firstly, “science demands a significantly more ambitious response”. Secondly, “the Paris Agreement provides the framework for action, so we must operationalise it”. Thirdly, “we have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos, to consolidate the financial commitments made in Paris and to assist the most vulnerable communities and nations”. Fourthly, “climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better”.Minister for Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton, who attended the opening session, said: “The decisions we take now will define the next century. I recently received Government approval to develop an all of government plan to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. Mr Guterres’s comments underline what we are seeking to do and highlight the urgency of this work.”Ireland was fully committed to the implementation of the Paris agreement, he added. “Over the next two weeks, we will work with countries all over the world to put together a rule book to make sure we all fulfil our commitments. We also look forward to . . . getting an honest evaluation of our climate efforts to date. We need to be honest with where we are at so that we get to where we need to be,” Mr Bruton said.The World Bank announced it is doubling investments in climate action with $200 billion for 2021-2025, including $50 billion towards helping countries adapt to the impacts of global warming.Bank president Jim Yong Kim said the poorest and most vulnerable people were at the greatest risk, and urged other financial institutions to follow its lead.“We are pushing ourselves to do more and go faster on climate and we call on the global community to do the same,” he said. “This is about putting countries and communities in charge of building a safer, more climate-resilient future.”Following Brazil’s recent withdrawal as host for COP25 next year, a spokeswoman for Mr Bruton said it would be relocated to a country in South America, as was required under UN rules. As to the possibility of Ireland hosting a COP, she said it was due to be staged in western Europe in 2020 but a conversation had yet to be had on where it would be staged. – Additional reporting: "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3717418.1543838360!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how to improve ireland s small towns irish times readers share their ideas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPremises for sale in Kiltimagh, Co Mayo. File photograph: Alan BetsonA report published on Friday found that small towns in Ireland are suffering a long drawn-out decline and are in urgent need of attention. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) said action was needed to ensure their survival and warned that factors such as increased costs, the legacy of out-of-town shopping centres, the dissolution of town councils and high vacancy rates have all contributed to a “perfect storm” for regional high streets.The  asked its readers for their suggestions and views on what can be done to reverse this decline. We got a huge response to this.The biggest obstacle to the sustainable regeneration of rural towns and villages is the internationalisation of lifestyles and expectations. Irish people are not happy to be Irish anymore -- we aspire to be like New Yorkers, Sheiks and Los Angelenos! People shop with choice and comfort in mind and will less attention to the impact of our choices. Hence people drive to the suburban shopping centres without awareness of fuel consumption, pollution or impact on the local economy. A traditional tea and cake shop will not survive today unless it has the ability to offer 15 kinds of coffees and 15 kinds of teas and a cake menu that has 15 warnings on it about which ingredients you should not eat. We are driven by a need to have a drink that looks and tastes like no one else’s. And we prefer to have the coffee “in my own space”, be this walking around with a disposable but compostable cardboard container or sitting in a crowded space but staring into an anti-social i-device with apps called “social media”. People flee from the smaller villages and towns under an illusion: they have bought into a myth that urban and bigger are better. And once they leave, they experience an inordinate pressure to not betray the myth even if, like the Irish emigrants of the 1800s, they discover that they were much more content and happier at home. Rather than face back home and learn again to have a conversation with the person at the counter, they opt for intermittent escapes to foreign villas and country cottages designed to accommodate people whose dissonance may be eased by spending a week in a village without having any contact with its permanent residents. The first step in regeneration of towns and villages is an honest evaluation of the enduring quality of life for people who live in and make them sustainable. This also calls for openness to assessing the effects of the growth of suburban townships. We may not be at this open door yet.In France, there is apparently a government scheme which provides farmers and pensioners with weekly vouchers to eat in their local eateries. If implemented here, it could go a long way to reversing the decline of rural Ireland. The main benefits of the initiative as I see it are outlined below.• Existing local cafes, shops, restaurant bars and businesses will see an increased footfall as the farmers and pensioners use their weekly vouchers.• New jobs will be generated as new eateries and businesses will open to get a piece of the increased footfall.• Construction jobs will be created to build and refurbish buildings to accommodate the new eateries and businesses.• As the towns and villages become vibrant again, young people will once again start building houses in the area, further increasing local employment.• Providing vouchers so that people must visit eat-in eateries will go a long way towards tackling the social isolation that many farmers and pensioners suffer from in modern society.• It will provide a regular social outlet to people who have lost this due to drink driving restrictions.• The community will be better able to keep an eye on and support frail and vulnerable people.• Young people will be able to gain employment locally, rather having to commute or move to the larger urban centres.Rather than the annual token gesture each budget day of giving pensioners a minuscule increase in their pension, why not providing them with vouchers to eat in their local eateries? The vouchers could be posted to them monthly, or automatically loaded onto some sort of payment card, or their social security card, with restrictions that it could only be used for eat-in food within say 10 – 15 km of their Eircode, thereby keeping the money in the local economy.I would like town planners to have a plan for each town to try and get a complete set of shops into each town and village. Each small town should have a newsagents, baker, butcher, vegetable shop, clothing shop, barber, hairdresser, and a gift shop and cafe. Each should support one another and have no rates and low rent for the initial one or two years to help them set up and establish in the community. Each town should have the same skeleton plan and locals should be encouraged and trained to take on these businesses, through local community boards and county council.I would like to see all town centres rejuvenated. Add spaces to walk or sit. Have a community cafe at the heart of the town open some evenings too. Have transport to bring rural isolated people into the centre and have social events there. Go back to having a post office with a shop and coffee place all under one roof. Instead of empty shops turn some of these into residential and encourage people working in larger towns to live there. Bring back the pulsing heart of any community by providing a place to meet with others. Get empty buildings remained and encourage others to live in the community. Provide good links to main cities and towns. With rents so high in cities it’s a good time to look at alternatives.One small step - directly elected mayors in every town. These would be resourced with training and expertise. I know of one small town in France that has been totally transformed by a dynamic and resourceful mayor. At the moment it seems no one is in charge of our little towns, they are being run by administrators and are slowly dying.Infrastructure: re-open the railroads that were previously dug out as well as train stations in small towns. Longwood has less than five shops and you’ll have to take a 15 minute drive to get to the closest station… I find small towns have issues with isolation especially for the younger generation who don’t have access to their own vehicle, they can’t rely on their busy parents all the time to go over a few towns to see their friends.I returned to my hometown, Wicklow when we had our second child. It’s a beautiful town with pretty streetscape, a river, lakes, mountain views, pebble beach \u0026amp stunning headland. It has all the ingredients for a tourist destination but it’s not thriving. There was great hope when the local hotel was taken over recently but it’s now become a direct provision centre, despite there being other State-owned vacant property in the town (disused local hospital). The court closed but the court service has left the building empty. The town hall is empty after the town council was dissolved. All within doors of each other which badly affected cafes etc around them. A hotel in the Main Street is derelict \u0026amp crumbling. I’d like to see State-owned property used as local resources – as art centres and to encourage start up businesses. I think owners of derelict buildings should be heavily fined to encourage them to sell them on or renovate them. There are a small number of people who own a lot of empty retail spaces. Rates are so high they strangle enterprise. I think certain businesses should be given discounted rents to encourage them while betting shops, off-licences and fast food should be limited. Multi-storey car parks could be built in facades of shop fronts on or near Main Street to encourage people to shop in town - no out of town shopping centres. I’d love to see IDA bring businesses to the town. No employer replaced VEHA or Celmac so if you.Stop people building one off housing outside the towns. They are like out of town shopping centres. If you live in the town and walk to the shop you will nearly always walk to the nearest shop. If you live outside the down and taking the car, you will go where the parking is the easiest and may even drive past shops as it does not take much more effort to drive a bit further. Empty or derelict houses in town centres should be forced to sell to private iniduals who will renovate, not allowed to sell on for another 10 years, grants or VAT back on refurbishment costs.Firstly, I would dust off a map of the rural railway network that existed throughout Ireland in the first half of the last century and draft studies as to how lines could be reopened. State-subsidised, frequent and efficient transit would in the long term support rural Ireland by allowing people commute to centres of employment in a time and cost efficient manner. Secondly, I would study how people created businesses in rural Ireland such as Kerry Group, Glanbia, King, Fexco etc to understand what the ingredients and impediments to their respective successes and learn from this.Limit the amount of fast food restaurant, bookies and charity shops that can open. Make businesses put up quality name plates, not horrible cheap plastic ones. Lower rates, online shopping is a big challenge to small town - help the small shops to compete and stay in business. Provide better parking facilities. Give incentives for business to paint their premises and keep their footpath clean and tidy.More and better playgrounds for kids.Keep all the global fast foodcoffee companies out...Ask Clonakilty what they did. It was a reasonably miserable grey town in the 70s and now a buzzing place winter and summer.Support your local shops and stop driving to the Lidl and Aldi stores in the bigger towns and citiesWhy don’t we start a scheme to give older rural people the option to move into nearby towns from the surrounding countryside to live (shared living) in all the empty houses on our Main Streets.Obviously, these houses will need to be adopted and modified to accommodate our senior citizens.This scheme will have a triple benefit1) brings older people closer to amenities - shops, post office and doctors etc. No need for cars, buses etc.2) Frees up larger houses in the rural area vacated by those that opt for the scheme for young families to buyrent.3) Brings more people into town centres thus creating a community effect which will act as a antidote to the loneliness experienced by many of our senior citizens.Boom! Think I’ll run for Minister meThomas Greenan Compulsory demolition of derelict buildings, it’s time we cleared up this countryPlain and simple...invest in transportation infrastructure. If you can’t attract young families  sustainable population growth then facilitating development becomes difficult because there’s no justification for investment. We’re letting Dublin and the GDA cannibalise the potential of these smaller towns as homes  destinations due in part to the difficulty of getting from Point A to Point B.Some of the closed shops will never reopen - why not do them up and turn them into accommodation for families etc - people can walk to local shopspubsrestaurants - surely this would be better than seeing neglected properties getting more and more dilapidated as time goes by.I wonder if a few derelict town houses were set aside for families at a much reduced price (and or a grant available to help rebuild into a family home) to encourage families to live in the town once more. Bring life back with youngsters. Then plan shops and businesses around them.This makes me laugh! They should have asked these questions 25 years ago, the death of small towns started with large supermarkets and superstores on their fringes, selling cheaper than any independent family owned shop could even buy the goods. They can cry now towns are dead! I say turn these closed-down shops into houses...give grants to people to paint them up. Broadband internet access is critical for any small town.Abolish county councils and set up district authorities around every major town. Allow them to set, raise and lower their own land value property taxes that would be on every inch of land in the state. Allow them to run state-of-the-art primary care centres, care doc, fire, ambulance, street lights, district roads, schools nursing homes and hospitals if there is a hospital in the district. They should also provide home help. They should also be responsible for planning.Prior to retirement, I was Senior Planner to Cork County Council and served as President of the Irish Planning Institute from 2007 - 2009. My suggestions include: Zero VAT on refurbishment of older town centre residential small retail properties. Relief from commercial rates on (smaller) town centre retail properties. Supplementary rates on non town centre retailoffice properties where car parking provided on site. Funds raised to be ringfenced for town centre enhancement schemes including improved provision of public car parking. Double VAT on on-line transactions. Ring fence funds for TC improvements as above. National programme of town centre environmental improvements so that town centres compete with shopping centres in terms of environmental quality and safety and ease of parking.I live in Kiltimagh and have had a pub for over 30years. The town is dying slowly, but surely. Everything is against small businesses.Create retirement hubs with a mix of city people wishing to downsize to a less frenetic locality with support services employing local people. Ground floor properties upgraded to provide ease of access for less physically able and upper storeys for the more able.I used to live in a town in Tipperary. It appears that if you have a strong politician in your area your town will do well. Your local politician should be actively working to make your area better for the people who live there. If they aren’t doing this then they need a mixture of pressure and help to start doing their job properly, or they need to be replaced . . . Work together to show everyone what your community can do when you work together. Use everyone who’s willing. Use your nursing home, schools, playground, tidy towns, doctors clinic, history, etc.I believe a community hub, funded and run by the community will bring more life into villages and small town centres. The buildings could be used: for just a place for people to meet up have teacoffee read from donated books have meetings for local clubssocieties space for yoga classes etc. The spaces should be bright, well kept and warm.They could be used for all age groups from the elderly for tea evenings to the young for a place to meet. They should have internet facilities and working spaces with access to printing or faxing. In my local town there are older, beautiful buildings falling into disrepair that would benefit from being used and brought back to life.I see the decimation of many Irish towns. Beautiful buildings left to rot. It has a huge impact on the psyche of the communities. Property owners must be forced to repair, rent or sell and if not pay high penalties. Young, small, indigenous businesses should be given incentives like tax breaks, lower rates when they can be proven to have invested in the area or have created jobs. Proper policy and give the communities the tools to do it for themselves! I’ve just realised I have asked for something that is supposed to be already in place...but it’s not happening...how depressing!!I watched the 6 O’Clock News on Friday 30th of November and one news item was the depopulation of towns. The news item featured Castledermot but also had pictures of derelict and boarded up shop fronts showing how derelict some of the towns have become. When towns fight back it seems to be the SMEs that band together create niche for arts, crafts and food. But what sticks out is depopulation, with a steady move by the rural population moving to Dublin. The response needs to be bold and imaginative.Where you have entire streets boarded up the depopulation speaks for itself. So why not give local authorities or co-operatives funding to buy up these traditional shops? They could be transformed by funding.During the good times our Government took taxes happily from hard working businesses yet rural Ireland is still not on par with rural Europe for infrastructure. Now if you look at Government spending in the regions it is often profitable companies getting large capital grants. Take the Government out of the equation. How about leaving rural Ireland untaxed or taxed at a lower rate so it can mend itself?Improve broadband and public transport give reduction in rates for shops starting up and business units as well encouraging people to live in small towns.Restore the railway network to how it was in 1920, when you were never more than six miles away from a station.Reduce the tax for shoppers ... reduce tax for business owners...abolish council rates...then you have happy business owners...happy shoppers...simple.One of the great factors for the development of small towns is partnerships between authorities and local community around tourism, for example hand crafts, local food, historical facts, monuments, farms with rural tourism development among others.Council rents are too high. There should be tax relief for businesses when they start up for the first couple of years. Support for local businesses who manufacture natural cultural products. High-speed broadband to every part of Ireland. Funding to paint and repair local streets every few years to make local towns attractive and prevent them falling into disrepair. No stamp duty for remote areas. Tax reliefgrant to repair old houses to original form.I think remote worker hubs would be great. Companies are spending a lot of money putting people into expensive city centre offices, and a smaller, shared-services centre in a smaller town would give people s good place to work with great broadband near to coffee shops and restaurants in small towns.Abolish all business rates for a minimum of ten years for towns with a population below a certain threshold. Get rid of paid parking in smaller towns. It’s driving people off the Main Street and into the likes of Aldi and Lidl which are usually away from the main street. Stop allowing the main streets to be controlled by a small number of business. In my town most shops on the main street are owned by four families and they are able to block planning applications by other businesses.Two major retailers were refused planning permission in our town due to objections from local small businesses. Stop focusing on creating all new business in the capital and in the main town of the county. If people live and work in the same town they will also shop in their own town. When people are gone 12 hours every day between commuting and working, they aren’t shopping locally. There is more to Ireland than the m50. Create things for people to do. When I was growing up we had a cinema, now my teens go by train to go to the cinema, open cinemas, bowling ally’s, night cafes safe places for people to go.Let people who are self employed pay a stamp so they can have the same social welfare and pension rights as an employed person. Put a cap on insurance or provide a Government insurance for business so that businesses aren’t going broke from insurance costs. Several shops have closed because they can no longer afford the astronomical cost of insurance. Between cost of rent, insurance and business rates businesses can no longer afford to remain open and it deters others from even considering trying.Growing up in a small town i have experienced this issue personally. Everyone in a small town pays their fair share and yet reaps less of the overall benefits.The consequence is these towns become underdeveloped and becoming less and less profitable over time and this in turn gives ample excuse for why it is not a priory for investment from the Government. The only answer is that small towns have got to stop waiting for Government investment and instead start to invest in themselves.Co-Ops, where those involved reap the benefits, buying and selling products or services just like any other business. The difference is a co-op is owned and governed by its members, the people who use it.And, profits are reinvested in the co-op or distributed to its members making it local business where profits will immediately benefit the locals who invest in itLocals need to empower themselves rather than waiting for a Government that has no idea how to tackle the issue.Co-operatives have a proven strategy for achieving positive economic and social development outcomes in wide range of settings.I am originally from a small town. What is killing small towns: transport. In order for small towns to thrive, people and goods need to be easily moved in and out. Younger generations have attained higher levels of education and naturally want to work in bigger companies with career prospects. Bigger companies are in cities. There was a time when a rail network linked small towns with big cities, but the State decided that cars were the future.Reinstating the rail network is the only way young families like mine can continue to work for big companies in big cities while living and spending in small towns. Young people are now being forced to live near cities because a 3-hour round commute by car is unsustainable. Put the tracks back down, give people the option of living rurally, small towns will thrive and you will solve the housing crisis as an offshoot.This is actually quite simple, the reason for the decline of towns is jobs, or lack thereof, a town without jobs has nothing. Many Irish towns have heritage buildings or ruins which are currently boarded up, these have tourist potential and can be restored at relative low cost, one restored they can generate jobs in those towns.As an Irish person living in London for over 28 years and a frequent visitor to Ireland, I have noticed a marked difference between some English villages and the decline of small Irish towns. One notable difference in in the UK is pedestrian access to the villages from surrounding areas.Many small villages in the UK have a pedestrian track running alongside the main roads so that people can walk to and from the village rather than drive. This is not a concrete footpath but a maintained dirt track which is used by walkers and cyclists. It keeps walkers and cyclists safe from speeding traffic and it also connects villages.I have family and friends who live in parts of Ireland not far from small towns and the only route available to access the town is by driving. A walkcycle to the towns on most occasions is dangerous with cars speeding and I am sure many pedestrian fatalities in the countryside could be avoided by creating these simple road verge tracks.I believe the towns are also declining as people choose to drive further afield to larger out of town shopping centres where parking is free and all purchases can be made at the same time.To counteract this, a free bus service on Saturday from designated pick up points to the towns would encourage people to shop local, reduce car use and connect local communities. I have witnessed this service in isolated villages in North Wales and it is amazing how it has taken off.Free Saturday buses to Aberystwyth and surrounding villages are packed with shoppers, local business is benefitting and communities are thriving. I am unsure who pays for this free Saturday service but the benefits to business seem to outweigh the cost of the service. I suggest planning for future housing is more about expanding towns with local services which in turn will create business opportunities for local people. Local communities need to come together to decide whether their town thrives or dies. People power is amazing but it takes someone to lead the transformation of these towns and villages. The government can incentivise through funding for small business but if people choose to go elsewhere then I’m afraid these towns will continue to decline. To paraphrase a famous quote, “it’s not what your town can do for you, but what can you do for your town?”All small towns should have a high-quality, free sports facilities, such as a safe and well-paved running walking track, an all weather Astro pitch, and a properly surfaced tennis court. These are relatively cheap to build, contribute hugely to peoples physical and mental well being, foster a sense of community and possibly make the town a more attractive tourist destination.Many of the towns around and about Ireland have beautiful old stone buildings. Unfortunately, in the main, they are covered over with rendering and cladding, and painted in hideous shades. As an example of what towns could look like I would offer Ambleside in the Lake District, where most of the buildings have kept their original stonework exposed.Bandon has to deal with large amount of heavy traffic which damages roads and makes the town dirty. It also makes walking unsafe within our small town. One-off developments just outside of town keeps everyone in their cars too. I would like to see out town centres loved and lived in with better facilities, parks, swimming pool, cinema, safe cycle tracks.Simple: make small towns destinations again. Instead of making them “easy to drive through” make them “easy to park in”. Ireland has rapidly changed from a family car society to a personal car society but urban planning has only focused on the traffic, not the people.Also, we do not drive to town for the day anymore, we drive to town for a quick shop. If you have to spend 20 minutes driving around looking for parking, why not spend 10 minutes driving to an out-of-town supermarket? Great examples are Gorey, thriving (great, convenient parking) and Enniscorthy, dying hard (difficult to navigate parking).If you want to see a real “destination” town, look at Wexford. In the 80s a bypass took away all the traffic that wasn’t going tofrom the town, and it flourished.About a mile of pedestrianised shopping with convenient car parks dotted along the route. On Saturdays, South Main Street in Wexford looks busier than Grafton Street. Urban planning needs to focus on people, not traffic. Cars don’t shop.One of the biggest failures in small towns is the failure to create pedestrian zones in the centre of the town. Create spaces that allow children to roam free and safe instead of allowing traffic to dominate the high street. Councils seem resistant to closing streets to traffic due to concerns about the adverse effect on local businesses which is ironic when so many studies show the opposite. Create a space where people might want to spend time in and they will come.I’m in my early seventies and considering sheltered accommodation  warden on site, with nursing home in the county for final days.A small town could be ideal. Local shops, within walking distance, mobile library, regular minibus to transport stations for coach train, taxi service to GP, or nearest Hospital. Links with local schools, for mutual enrichment between seniors and youth, home help to employ, dinner delivery service.....in fact a co-ordinated, targeted service run as a local business. Small town in rural area pleasant for walks in nature that is Zimmer accessible! Internet of course for Silver Surfers! Local church service a bonus but we can organise prayer servicesupport among ourselves.I think isolation is a huge problem in rural Ireland. Free or heavily subsidised buses should be offered to peripheral communities to allow people (particularly elderly people) to socialise with their neighbours. This might include bingo or a trip to the pub on a Saturday night. It might also allow people to access local services such as gyms  libraries  medical services. Economically, it would be a boon for local businesses as people will naturally spend more. The programme could simply follow the local school bus system for example and it could be limited to two or three days a week (e.g. on pension day and on a Saturday).Retired council architect and director of a SME. Central power is advantageous for large scale operations. It feeds into consolidation of businesses into ever growing big entities with financial specialists managing output, and the regulatory environment.Strategic planning goals favour private sector developers and large multinational multiples. Same process for very small issues and big regional, national international issues. Public procurement T\u0026ampC’s constantly undermine small business’ ability to participate. Local rates valuations and parking charges big issue. Online shopping, website costs and I believe the quality of the public realm in small towns is very poor. Having good experience in our towns is essential if the street is to survive. connectivity has issuesIt’s no good to say that large industry would move to small town Ireland if there was good broadband, because they wouldn’t. They are looking for things that can only be got in urban areas. However, if we look across the water to our American Cousin’s we can see that they are moving in the right direction in some areas. All businesses run on money, if you can reduce the operating costs by reducing rates then you can attract small niche “hipster” shops to open which can reinvent a place. The rise of the supermarket led to the death of the main St, but now Dunnes are trying to make shopping in their store like going to all the different shops you once had. The butcher, the green grocer’s etc. Yes, it was more expensive, but was it better? I don’t know, but cheaper has led to the death knell of small town Ireland. The only way to reinvent the small town is to encourage people to shop local, to buy the artisan products that are produced in an area, and maybe not buy everything in the one supermarket.In the recent past we have spent time in Ramelton, Co Donegal. I was shocked by the dilapidation of the 18th century stone pub, houses and warehouses at the end of the Quay. Instead of further development why could these not be restored and lived in? I was so shocked that I wrote to the local TD of the time and got a reply but as far as I know nothing has changed. I engaged with some local people and they agreed. It reminded me of the stone villages in Cumbria that are a magnet for tourism in the UK. Ramelton is a beautiful town and also has lovely Georgian architecture. The beautiful river Lennon and iconic bridge. It is supposed to be a Heritage Town but much of it is in a state of gross disrepair. There is ribbon development outside the town where the people seem to now live which is such a shame.Reduce commercial rates dramatically. Assist business owners in upgrading the appearance of their businesses as part of a town wide project. Broadband needed urgently."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Brendan Ogle says there has been no ideological rethink in order to solve homeless crisisSeveral legal authorities call for provocation to be replaced or codified in legislationAll three coal-fired units offline since engineering issues surfaced in SeptemberAuthorities regularly receive complaints over the use of the devicesEx-Royal Engineer says he wishes he could \u0026lsquoturn back time\u0026rsquo on \u0026lsquoa mad 30 seconds\u0026rsquoMan\u0026rsquos situation has deteriorated since he got a smartphone as a present, court toldHearing could have important implications for as many as 1,000 other casesCounsel for Brendan Glynn says client acted in \u0026lsquoimpulsive, bizarre and outlandish\u0026rsquo waySchool profile: Gaelchol\u0026aacuteiste Luimnigh LimerickDaughter of Co Louth man stabbed to death tells court he died for no fault of his ownPatrick Beauchamp (26) from Ballsbridge, Dublin also not guilty of headbutting manAnthony Graham (28) stole victim\u0026rsquos handbag in Finglas, north Dublin last January\u0026lsquoI was trying to ignore it all.

In 2016, Charlie died aged five, leaving Brianna and her family heartbroken. Things started to get back on track when a Great Dane called Walter and then a second, younger one called Willie came into their home.Brianna bonded particularly strongly with the younger Great Dane, and her seizures have steadily grown more manageable. However, the dogs went missing during a storm which hit the west coast last Wednesday, and Brianna’s mother Arabella Scanlan said the whole family was “gutted” following their disappearance.Brianna has been so upset at the dogs’ disappearance that her seizures have intensified over the last 24 hours. She has had four episodes since Sunday, after having been largely seizure-free for almost two months.“We live in a very remote house on the side of a mountain and the dogs have the run of the place. They like to sleep in the hay shed where it is nice and warm and that is where we just presumed they were during the storm,” Ms Scanlan said. “When we couldn’t find them on Thursday morning we hoped they had gone rambling but as time has passed I have grown more certain they have been taken. “They are just so good-natured. And while they are big dogs they are not fierce. The black dog would cower if anyone came near him and the harlequin would be really friendly.” Ms Scanlan said Willie was always at her daughter’s side.“He would never just go off. I have been to all the neighbours and to the guards and on Facebook and I don’t know what else to do,” she added. Ms Scanlan said Brianna “is in bits” and expressed the hope that if the dogs have been taken, those involved will realise what they have done and the impact it is having on her daughter and return them."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718825.1543864211!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit a guide to the crucial week ahead","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnti-Brexit campaigners protest outside the House of Commons in London, Britain. Photograph: Victoria JonesPA WireOn Tuesday, the historic five-day debate on the treaty intended to govern the UK’s withdrawal from the EU begins in the House of Commons, with a vote on whether to ratify the deal scheduled to take place there a week later, on Tuesday, December 11th.However, even before that debate begins, British prime minister Theresa May’s government is facing a challenge in the Commons over the release on Monday of a summary of the attorney general’s legal advice to the British government on the agreement with the EU. Last month MPs voted to have the advice released in full, but the government has instead only published a summary of the advice from attorney general Geoffrey Cox. Following the publication of the legal document on Monday, Mr Cox answered MPs’ questions on it and defended the decision not to release the full advice. Britain’s opposition Labour Party has said that if the advice is not published in full, it will begin court proceedings to find the government in contempt of parliament.Ms May’s ministers expect a furious assault on her withdrawal deal with the EU when the debate proper begins on Tuesday in the House of Commons. But the government will point to the lack of an alternative from her opponents, warning that voting down the deal brings the prospect of a second Brexit referendum closer. Indeed, on Monday environment secretary Michael Gove, one of the cabinet’s leading Brexiteers, said that there may now be a Commons majority for a second referendum.Also on Tuesday, an advocate general of the European Court of Justice is due to publish his non-binding opinion on whether the UK can unilaterally revoke article 50.Triggered by the British government on March 29th, 2017, article 50 governs the two-year negotiating period for countries leaving the EU. On the same day, EU finance ministers will meet in Brussels, where the European Commission’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit are intensifying, for a series of seminars and meetings on how to prepare for the possibility of the UK crashing out of the union next March without a deal.Ms May will be in the Commons on Wednesday for prime minister’s questions, as the debate on the withdrawal treaty continues for the rest of the week. By the end of the week, Ms May will have to show some progress in winning over Conservative MPs to support her deal. Last week, a whip count by the  estimated that almost 100 Conservative MPs could vote against the withdrawal treaty, consigning Ms May to a heavy defeat from which she could find it difficult to recover.On Sunday, the prime minister is due to take on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in a live televised debate on the deal, just two days before the House of Commons vote.On the day of the vote itself, MPs are likely also to be asked to vote on a number of amendments to the government motion – any one of which could potentially derail the treaty’s ratification. A House of Commons briefing paper makes clear that if MPs voted to approve the deal but subjected it to certain amendments, this would not fulfil the legal requirement for ratification. The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has said he will accept up to six amendments.Labour has said it will table a no-confidence motion in Ms May to force a general election if MPs reject her deal. If that fails, the party has said it would then seek support in the Commons for another referendum.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: PA Geoffrey Cox brought the drama of the courtroom into the House of Commons on Monday as he made the case for Theresa May’s deal as if it was a highly dubious defendant. As a successful criminal barrister, Cox knows there is no point in attempting to gloss over a client’s darker side when seeking to persuade a jury that the charge is not proven.So he outlined the terms of the backstop, warts and all, acknowledging that Britain could not leave it without the EU’s agreement.“The truth of the matter is that this Northern Ireland protocol would represent a solemn commitment to the people of Northern Ireland that this government will honour and respect the Belfast Agreement. I make no bones about it, I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination of this backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit if negotiations have irretrievably broken down,” he said.Legal advice, he said, could only inform what was a political decision that required MPs to weigh the risk of being trapped indefinitely in the backstop against the risk of a disorderly, no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.The DUP’s Ian Paisley was impressed by Cox’s candour but said it only served to make clearer than ever the backstop’s consequences for Northern Ireland.“It is the case that the stark reality of what he has set out, to any person living in Northern Ireland, is that as a result of NI ending up in this backstop, which would be utterly shameful, NI would become an annex of the United Kingdom when it comes to trading relations during the backstop period,” Paisley said.Cox made a good argument for the backstop being as unwelcome to the EU as it was to Britain because it would give Northern Ireland’s traders a competitive edge over their EU counterparts. Unfortunately for Theresa May, however, Emmanuel Macron undermined that argument fatally after last week’s EU summit, when he told French reporters that Britain could be trapped in the backstop if it failed to compromise on fishing rights.As the prime minister prepares to open five days of debate ahead of a “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal, the number of Conservative MPs publicly opposed to it suggests it will be defeated heavily next week. Dublin is jittery at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit if May’s deal is rejected but there is no concession short of the effective neutering of the backstop that could sway enough MPs for her to win the vote."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3717529.1543771818!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd curtains for the clintons","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“The Clintons refuse to be discarded. It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate.” Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFPGetty ImagesToronto: the snow is falling lightly.I’m feeling something foreign, something I’ve never felt before. It takes me a moment to identify it.I’m feeling sorry for the Clintons.In the 27 years I’ve covered Bill and Hillary, I’ve experienced a range of emotions. They’ve dazzled me and they’ve disgusted me.But now they’re mystifying me.I’m looking around Scotiabank Arena, the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and it’s a depressing sight. It’s two-for-the-price-of-one in half the arena. The hockey rink is half curtained off, but even with that, organisers are scrambling at the last minute to cordon off more sections behind thick black curtains, they say due to a lack of sales. I paid $177 weeks in advance. (I passed on the pricey meet-and-greet option.) On the day of the event, some unsold tickets are slashed to single digits.I get reassigned to another section as the Clintons’ audience space shrinks. But even with all the herding, I’m still looking at large swathes of empty seats – and I cringe at the thought that the Clintons will look out and see that, too. It was only four years ago, after all, that Canadians were clamouring to buy tickets to see the woman who seemed headed for history.It’s a sad contrast with the sold-out boffo book tour of Michelle Obama, who’s getting a lot more personal for the premium prices. But introspection has never been within the Clintons’ range.I can’t fathom why the Clintons would make like ageing rock stars and go on a tour of Canada and the United States at a moment when Democrats are hoping to break the stranglehold of their cloistered, superannuated leadership and exult in a mosaic of exciting new faces.What is the point? It’s not inspirational. It’s not for charity. They’re not raising awareness about a cause, like Al Gore with global warming. They’re only raising awareness about the Clintons.It can’t be the money at this point. Have they even spent all the Goldman gold yet? Do they want to swim in their cash like Scrooge McDuck?The Clintons’ tin cup is worthy of the Smithsonian. They hoovered more than $2 billion in contributions to their campaigns, foundation and philanthropies.After the White House, the money-grubbing raged on, with the Clintons making more than 700 speeches in a 15-year period, blithely unconcerned with any appearance of avarice or of shady special interests and foreign countries buying influence. They stockpiled a whopping $240 million. Even leading up to her 2016 presidential run, Hillary was packing in the speeches, talking to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, the American Camp Association, eBay, and there was that infamous trifecta of speeches for Goldman Sachs worth $675,000.“What scares me the most is Hillary’s smug certainty of her own virtue as she has become greedy and how typical that is of so many chic liberals who seem unaware of their own greed,” Charlie Peters, the legendary liberal former editor of the Washington Monthly, told me. “They don’t really face the complicity of what’s happened to the world, how selfish we’ve become and the horrible damage of screwing the workers and causing this resentment that the Republicans found a way of tapping into.” He ruefully worries about the Obamas in this regard, too.Indeed, in the era of Trump, greed is not only good. It’s grand. The stock market is our highest value. Mammonism rules.But watching the Clintons hash over their well-worn tale of falling in love at Yale Law School, I realise that it’s not only about the money.Some in Clintonworld say Hillary fully intends to be the nominee. Once more, in Toronto, she didn’t rule it out, dodging the question with a lame joke. She carries herself with the air of a president in exile. Her consigliere, Philippe Reines, has prodded reporters on including her name when they write about 2020 candidates.And Bill has given monologues to old friends about how Hillary knows how she’d have to run in 2020, that she couldn’t have a big staff and would just speak her mind and not focus-group everything. (That already sounds focus-grouped.)After losing to an orange puffer clown fish who will go down as one of the most destructive forces in American history and flushing the Obama legacy down the drain, that’s delusional. Some Obama associates say the former president has some regrets about throwing his support solely behind Hillary and knows he misread the anger and frustration of voters.Bill was radioactive in the midterms and Hillary was the Ghost of Christmas Past. Her approval rating is at a record low of 36 per cent. The only American who seems truly interested in her these days is president Donald Trump, who can’t stop tweeting about her. She’s still money in his book.The Clintons refuse to be discarded. It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate. The way that the whole thing came crashing down in 2016 is too hard for them to bear. They would like to rewrite the ending, but there is no way to do that.Nothing they have done lately suggests that they have learned anything, including their obtuse post-#MeToo comments about Monica Lewinsky, who has been far more candid and sympathetic in the 20th anniversary retellings of the impeachment saga. The Clintons are still unable to hold themselves accountable. The formerly golden couple who dominated their party for nearly three decades is travelling North America in a bubble, shockingly un-self-aware.Their pathological need to be relevant in America is belied by a Canadian arena, where stretches of empty seats bear witness to the passing of their relevance.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

From September onwards, we were just getting ready for the carnage to start.However, Mr Hollyoake, 71, dismissed reports of any neighbourhood conflict and pointed out that the event had raised more than £70,000 for charity.His son Jason Dean, who oversees the entertainment, said: “There were about three houses that complained about the road closure. The council couldn’t see much in their reasons and supported us.We put a letter through one of their doors asking if they would meet with us but they never got back to us. We were happy to meet with them but they just weren’t playing ball.”Mr Timms added: I think people raising money for charity is a wonderul thing to do, don\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027m not trying to be \u0027bah humbug\u0027 - but there\u0027s always another side to it. Harvard sued over clamp down on single gender fraternities and sororities Oliver Robbins clashes with Jacob Rees-Mogg as he defends \u0026#39uncomfortable\u0026#39 Brexit backstop British woman kidnapped by Somali pirates backs appeal of only man convicted over ordealTheresa May urges Nicola Sturgeon to listen to Scottish business after Sir Ian Wood praises dealReconstruction: How tempers flared in the Commons as Geoffrey Cox faced criticism on all sides over Brexit deal legal adviceSir David Attenborough issues dire warning about climate changeAnnual Theatre Awards cancelled after opera shortlisted for prize consisted of all white actors playing non-white roles GP convicted of running illegal transgender clinic for childrenComment: Geoffrey Cox: Queen’s Counsel, Attorney General... and our finest actor since OlivierImmigration policy \u0026#39very unlikely\u0026#39 to be revealed before Brexit vote, says Sajid JavidTalking Strictly podcast: Ore Oduba on Ashley Roberts - \u0026#39It was one of the best quicksteps ever, I wish people would vote on face value\u0026#39Badgers behind mysterious sinkhole which shut road for a year - and will cost £50,000 to fixTaliban leader summons envoys to  consult over next round of talksVIP paedophile accuser \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 named for the first time as Carl BeechComment:  Vegan evangelists need to stop behaving with the ine certainty of a religious cult\u0026#39That s*** doesn\u0026#39t work all the time\u0026#39: Michelle Obama criticises Sheryl Sandberg\u0026#39s \u0026#39lean in\u0026#39 feminismAustria to cut benefits for immigrants with poor language skillsEthical veganism could be considered a religion in landmark tribunal caseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deliveroo tampons contraceptives circumventing stigma rural","story":"Kasha allows women to order health products and contraceptives online to avoid embarrassment and stigmaDepartment for International DevelopmentOn a continent which has often neglected women’s health, Rwanda is making waves. Almost half of married women in the country use contraception, a dramatic increase since the millenium when this figure was just six per cent. But challenges persist and Kasha, a \u0027femtech\u0027 start-up, has developed what amounts to a Deliveroo for women\u0027s health to overcome embarrassment in the East African country. “Around the world women are not going to clinics - it’s such a big deal to go in and ask for things like contraceptives and menstrual products,” Joanna Bichsel, CEO and co-founder of Kasha, told The . “We want to change the way women, especially in developing countries, are able to access health products.”Established only two and a half years ago in Rwanda, the company has recently launched in Kenya. It allows thousands of women to order affordably priced products - from sanitary pads and condoms to shampoos and body lotions - on their mobile phones. Customers can order online, or those without smartphones can dial *119 to use an offline, text message based version to make purchases. The orders are then dispatched and delivered to their door in discreet packaging by moped or, in particularly remote regions, a local Kasha ‘agent’. Access to contraception“There was absolutely a gap in technology serving women and women’s needs,” said Joanna, who started the company with business partner Amanda Arch after leaving the Seattle tech bubble. “We have an e-commerce model, but we have chosen to optimise for women and underserved consumers.The approach appears to be working Kasha delivered its 100,000th order this month and has close to 20,000 customers. Products which are seen as \u0027embarrassing\u0027 to purchase in shops - including sanitary pads, condoms, HIV tests and emergency contraception - have been the most popular purchases. “We serve women across segments, from low income women in rural communities to executive women in offices,” said Dianne Dusaidi, Rwanda country director. “We’ve actually been surprised with how popular we’ve been with rural areas, we thought Kasha might just appeal to the middle classes.”Contraception use has skyrocketed in Rwanda, but stigma remainsCentral to the company\u0027s appeal is what it calls the Kasha ladies. Built on an Avon-style model, the company employs 75 women who work in predominantly rural communities, to build trust with clients and explain how e-commerce - still in its infancy in Rwanda - works. “The majority of our agents are widows, single mothers or breadwinners,” said Malyse Uwase, regional health and impact manager. “We look for women who are motivated and trusted in their community, who can talk through products and help people through the ordering process. They’re the face of Kasha.” Kasha received funding from the UK’s Department of International Development (DfID) and Unilever’s Transform programme to get started, but hopes to be profitable and self sufficient by early 2020 - and to expand across the developing world.Kasha was built to be global, said Joanna. More people should be watching the \u0027femtech\u0027 space, it has the potential to revolutionise women’s health.” Newsletter promotion -

Neither a standard-issue coalition between the PSOE - which sunk to its lowest ever victory margin in the region with just 33 seats - and Left-wing Podemos,  nor a conservative alliance between the Popular Party (PP) and centre-Right Ciudadanos can now muster a majority.  But those mainstream political parties have differing viewpoints on the desirability of a kingmaker party with policies that include the mass expulsion of illegal immigrants, banning abortion and repealing legislation that protects women from violence.  The Andalusian and national leaders of Vox, Francisco Serrano and Santiago Abascal, after the shock result in Spain\u0026#39s most populous regionActing Andalusian President Susana Díaz pleaded with other moderate political forces to join her in a united front against the ultra-conservative Vox.Both the PP and Ciudadanos have seized on the prospect of turfing the Socialists out of power for the first time since Andalusia’s regional government was installed in 1982. But while the PP said it would accept the support of Vox to take office, Ciudadanos displayed reticence. “We are going to take on the challenge of forming a government in Andalusia,” said PP leader Pablo Casado after his party finished second behind the PSOE with 26 seats, snubbing the Socialists’ call for a cross-bench coalition. “We have nothing to discuss with the PSOE.”But third-placed Ciudadanos argued that the new government in Andalusia had to come from the centre of the political spectrum, It called on the PP to back their candidate and for the Socialists to stand aside and abstain, thus making Vox’s support unnecessary.Vox’s chief candidate in Andalusia, Francisco Serrano, suggested that his party would support a right-of-centre coalition in Andalusia, although the party is meeting later in the week to decide on its strategy before official talks take place. “We will not be an obstacle to ending the Socialist regime,” he said.  Please review our commenting policyHarvard sued over clamp down on single gender fraternities and sororities Oliver Robbins clashes with Jacob Rees-Mogg as he defends \u0026#39uncomfortable\u0026#39 Brexit backstop British woman kidnapped by Somali pirates backs appeal of only man convicted over ordealTheresa May urges Nicola Sturgeon to listen to Scottish business after Sir Ian Wood praises dealReconstruction: How tempers flared in the Commons as Geoffrey Cox faced criticism on all sides over Brexit deal legal adviceSir David Attenborough issues dire warning about climate changeAnnual Theatre Awards cancelled after opera shortlisted for prize consisted of all white actors playing non-white roles GP convicted of running illegal transgender clinic for childrenComment: Geoffrey Cox: Queen’s Counsel, Attorney General... and our finest actor since OlivierImmigration policy \u0026#39very unlikely\u0026#39 to be revealed before Brexit vote, says Sajid JavidTalking Strictly podcast: Ore Oduba on Ashley Roberts - \u0026#39It was one of the best quicksteps ever, I wish people would vote on face value\u0026#39Christmas lights display on \u0026#39UK\u0026#39s most festive street\u0026#39 is unwanted by half of neighbours, former resident claimsBadgers behind mysterious sinkhole which shut road for a year - and will cost £50,000 to fixTaliban leader summons envoys to  consult over next round of talksVIP paedophile accuser \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 named for the first time as Carl BeechComment:  Vegan evangelists need to stop behaving with the ine certainty of a religious cult\u0026#39That s*** doesn\u0026#39t work all the time\u0026#39: Michelle Obama criticises Sheryl Sandberg\u0026#39s \u0026#39lean in\u0026#39 feminismAustria to cut benefits for immigrants with poor language skillsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/03/TELEMMGLPICT000182592733_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5spYqw61n_irA3tdmBFD1byHfuMYd0B-U1tqVGaNReE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"vegan evangelists need stop behaving divine ordinance religious","story":"One of the most striking features of life these days is the way that groups, ideas and people which formerly inhabited the loony fringes of society have moved into its very centre.

England’s success at the World Cup and good weather undoubtedly helped.“The chancellor’s\u0026nbspdecision in the Budget to freeze beer tax and lower business rates for thousands of pubs will make a huge difference to the viability of the sector moving forward, but Brexit looms large though, and brewers and publicans alike need certainty.”He added: “Clarity on the transition period from 29 March onwards, and a strong steer on the future relationship with the EU, would be a boost to the trade and beer sales. A no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running.

More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent.

Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That’s why the best solution, for the country and the politicians who will be asking for our vote sooner, is to act decisively and support our call for a vote on the deal, before it’s too late.”National Union of StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site.

It’s also unknown which supporting characters will be returning, however, Fukunaga was quick to shoot down any rumours the film won’t feature with Q (Ben Whishaw) or Blofeld (Christoph Waltz).“Who is saying those rumours?“ he asked, adding: We haven’t finished the screenplay, so there is no way that anyone could know that. Those are two extraordinary actors, so if there is space for them in the story, I would absol\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The women who could play Bond Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.utely want them there.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We cannot change anything without breaking the law and we Brits don’t do that. We play by the rules.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the anti-Brexit European Research Group, said the paper “exposes inaccurate government spin on the proposed Brexit deal”.The most controversial issue in the withdrawal agreement is over the ‘backstop’ agreement, to set out what happens to keep the Irish border open if no trade deal is secured by the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.Under the plan the whole UK would stay in a customs union, but the legal document released on Monday confirms that this set up would continue to apply “unless and until it is superseded” by a subsequent agreement.It later goes on: “The agreement does not contain any provision on its termination.“In the absence of such a provision, it is not possible under international law for a party to withdraw from the agreement unilaterally.”The advice also confirms that the UK faces making additional payments to Brussels if the Brexit transition period is extended.Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement it is due to run until the end of December 2020 but can be extended by up to two years if both sides agree.The advice says that discussions on any extension would involve “reaching further agreement on the UK’s financial contribution”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ...

But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It is not going to be straightforward.”Russia has been accused of interfering in western politics, including the US presidential race which put Donald Trump in the White House, the elections in France and Germany and referendums on Brexit and Catalan independence.\u0026nbspSecurity cooperation with Europe ‘imperative’, MI6 chief saysBut while there have been accusations of Beijing’s industrial espionage in the west, direct action has so far come from neighbouring countries. Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from providing 5G on grounds of national security.In only his second public address in four years as “C”, in charge of MI6, Mr Younger warned of the threat of technological espionage and “malign activity” by foreign powers.He said: “Our approach to attaching a cost to malign activity also applies to cyber attacks, as in March this year when the UK attributed responsibility for the NotPetya attack against Ukraine, which also affected the United Kingdom, to the Russian government.“Much of the evolving state threat is about our opponents’ increasingly innovative exploitation of modern technology. So simply put, we’ve got to innovate faster than they can. Indeed, future generations would not forgive us if it were otherwise.”We’ve got to innovate faster than they can. Indeed, future generations would not forgive us if it were otherwise“The need is to ensure that technology is on our side, not that of our opponents,” Mr Younger continued, describing how it had helped expose the Russian spies who allegedly poisoned former MI6 agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the Noivichok attack in Salisbury.“The digital era has profoundly changed our operating environment. Bulk data combined with modern analytics make the modern world transparent, a fact which contributed to GRU embarrassment after the Salisbury attack. But it is also a serious challenge if used against us,” he said, speaking at St Andrews University, where he studied economics and computer science before joining the British army and then MI6.“Cyber is now our fastest-growing directorate. We are shifting our focus to the nexus between humans and technology.“And for the first time, through the National Security Strategic Investment Fund, we are pursuing a completely different type of partnership with the tech-innovation community, giving the private and academic community the role we need and they deserve.”“Ironically, the most profound consequence of the technological challenge is a human one. We are determined to attract people with even higher levels of technical skill to join our ranks. But my organisation will need to adapt even faster if it is to thrive in the future. And that will require people with new perspectives, capable of harnessing their creativity in ways that we can’t yet even imagine.”Mr Younger also spoke about controversies surrounding two of Britain’s closes allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and UAE, over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the imprisonment of the British academic Matthew Hedges.The MI6 chief called the killing of Khashoggi, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October as “horrible” and\u0026nbsp“absolutely barbaric” and wanted to stress that there should be a “full and transparent investigation into what happened”.On the jailing of Mr Hedges, Mr Younger said he was “perplexed” by claims of the UAE authorities that he was a British spy. “I genuinely can’t understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"single mum bread universal credit money","story":"Joanne Davis, , whose husband left her earlier this year, has been living a “nightmare” while trying to claim for the new benefits system.The mum-of-two, who has long-term health conditions including MS, OCD and depression had waited five weeks for her benefits money to come through after making a claim - and has been threatened with eviction in the meantime.She told The Sun Online: “I couldn’t even afford a loaf of bread this week - my family had to give me money and cook for us.“It was my daughter’s birthday and I had to borrow the £ she was given.“I feel so guilty, I haven’t got another option.”Joanne, who can’t walk far because of her illnesses, had to visit her job centre several times to provide reams of proof before she got help - and had to beg for lts from family and friends to get there.Her husband previously sorted out her finances, but has now moved out of the family home leaving her and their two kids Hannah, , and Zoe, , behind.Joanne, who lives in the West Midlands, is just one of hundreds of Brits who say that going onto Universal Credit has pushed them into debt.In last month’s Budget the Chancellor announced a raft of measures to help ease their struggle - but they won’t come in for months.New DWP Secretary Amber Rudd has vowed to “fix” the problems with the flagship benefits system, which rolls six payments into one.Last week she even hinted she could slash the five-week wait to try and help those who are desperate waiting for their first payment.Joanne’s got letters and phonecalls saying she is almost £ in debt on her rent alone - and could face eviction from her houseshe doesn’t pay soon.She opted for a £ advance to help her while she waited but soon struggled with making ends meet.“I’m struggling to pay for anything including food for my girls,” she added.“I’ve been worried to death, I haven’t had anything to eat some days.“I’ve been going around to my family to get food - it makes me feel so bad.“Dad paid for us all to come over with a taxi so we could have a meal.”After waiting five weeks for her benefits to come through, she is now set to get around £, a month from UC - and her PIP disability payments are paid on top ofBut it was the “huge struggle” of waiting for it all to come through which really put a strain on the family, she said.Joanne’s former partner used to do everything beforehand for her, adding: “I never really did any shopping - or even had a bank account.”She’s slashed her bills to the minimum amount she feels is possible but still is struggling to pay the bills.“Universal Credit has been a nightmare, the benefits system should have been left how it is,” she added.“It’s caused me so much trouble and stress.”A DWP spokeswoman said: “We offer advances of up to  per cent of the first Universal Credit payment to help people who need extra support, and we’ve announced a £m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people with their claims.“Other benefits, such as Personal Independence Payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004516094471-e1543445105186.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain needs brexit leaders steve hilton opinion","story":"It says: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”When you look at the shambles Brexit has become, as far as Britain is concerned it’s not a possibility but a downright certainty.Let’s review the idiocy.It began with David Cameron stomping off in the biggest and most ruinous huff in history, leaving a sleep-deprived and shell-shocked Tory party scrambling to find a new leader overnight.Then Boris Johnson and Michael Gove threw away a golden opportunity as potential PM and deputy to achieve the vision of a positive, outward-looking, go-getting, post-Brexit Britain.Over a bizarre few days they stabbed each other in the back, shot themselves in the foot and indulged in whatever other self-harming metaphor you can think of.Their antics landed us with hapless and hopeless Theresa May, so desperate to prove she could deliver Brexit despite opposing it that she rushed into announcing the end-point without the faintest idea how to get there.More misguided Remainer pandering came from then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with her ludicrous plan to force businesses to list their foreign workers.This offensive announcement alienated Remain voters who might have given Brexit a chance and helped set in stone the horrible isiveness of the past two years.As Foreign Secretary, Boris made one gaffe after another, starting with the most heinous: Sticking to his silly remark about having your cake and eating it — guaranteed to wind up the EU bigwigs and make them even more determined to give Britain a rotten deal.On and on the idiocy has gone — from Philip Hammond trying to prove his discredited Project Fear predictions were right all along by being the most anti-businessConservative Chancellor anyone can remember, to Matt Hancock’s hysterical claims about people dying from a lack of medicineswe leave the EU without a deal. He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders.

When I went to Kenya I saw lions dying because they only ate once a month. Here they eat every single day.Name: Mars Desert Research StationLocation: UtahWho lives there  A group of eight scientistsWith plans to eventually form a colony on Mars - and Elon Musk saying he wants to put people on the red planet by , it seems important that humans are well prepared.Thats where the Mars Desert Research Station comes in. Built in the early noughties, it is a replica space station where scientists live exactly asit were Mars,  .The base is located in the remote desert of Utah near the small town of Hanksville.The area looks very like Mars due to the barren red rock, mountains and sand, as well as similar rock types to those found on the Red Planet.The tiny base, where eight scientists live on a rotating basis, is smaller than an average London one-bed flat and features bunk beds in tiny closet-style rooms.They have just one toilet to share, and are only able to eat freeze-dried food asthey are in Space.People tell us that we are running around playing dress-up in a spacesuit, but its not like that at all, says Dr Shannon Rupert, who heads up the project.Name: Noahs ArkLocation: The NetherlandsWho lives there  Dutch entrepreneur Aad PetersIn , Johan Huibers, a Dutch Christian fundamentalist, decided to build a replica of Noahs Ark as he wanted to save humanity from sin after having a vision.Painstakingly crafted, the replica is  metres long, . metres wide,  metres high and made of steel, pine and cedar.In , Huibers sold the ark for £, to Aad Peters, an entrepreneur who wanted to sail the vessel around Northern Europe with live animals on board including camels and elephants - two-by-two of course.However, Aad was forced to concede three months later that unlike in the Biblical Story, an ark is not a suitable home for animals, so he took them off board.Theres not a lot of space...its like camping on sea, says Aad. If the wind blows it and youre lying shivering under five blankets you wonder am I stupid  but it is what it is. If you choose to do something you have to do it.Last year, he collided with a few other boats during a storm, and its also caught fire.At present, it is currently anchored by a car park and is a museum filled with wooden animals, but Aad says he plans to sail the high seas once it is repaired.Name: Sandcastle HouseLocation: Rio de Janeiro, BrazilWho lives there  Marcio Mizael MatoliasSea views are desired by many of us - and Rio de Janeiro resident Marcio Mizael Matolia has found a nty way to get a prime spot without the hefty price tag.For the past  years, the self-styled King of the Castle, who is adorned with a plastic crown, has lived inside his sandcastle.He says the seat outside is his pulpit, where he sits for people to come and pay respect to him and donate money to him to help him live in his strange structure.The impressive creation, in an exclusive neighbourhood surrounded by luxury flats worth millions, has  turrets, which he made by hand using sand, drtwood and water.However, though it looks great from the outside, Marcios living space is a six metre square room held up by a wooden frame.I dug a hole, then put some wood underneath so it didnt sink, says Marcio. Its a real work of architecture and engineering.Unsurprisingly, there are some setbacks with this set up. He doesnt have amenities such as a toilet so he uses public loos when he needs a poo and wees in the sea.In the rainy season his castle washes away, meaning it needs constant repairs. It takes between six and eight hours to make a couple of towers, so he can find this incredibly frustrating.Name: Freedom CoveLocation: British Columbia, CanadaWho lives there  Wayne Adams and Catherine KingThe pair have lived on the secluded farm, which floats on the ocean and weighs  tonnes - the same as a ship - for  years.The home, which is anchored to shore using lines like a giant spiders web, boasts huge areas of garden, a multi-coloured house, art gallery, dance floor and even a lighthouse.Its here that Catherine grows fruit and vegetables while Wayne, who built all of Freedom Cove himself, creates additions to their home in his workshop. The pair also fish from a hole in the floor.However, the house has regularly suffered from severe storm damage as its built in an area known for high winds.The pair say the roof has blown off several times, and ious sections of it have been completely destroyed at times.Name: Falcons NestLocation: Prescott, ArizonaWho lives there  Tarot readers Ernst and SrishtiErnst and Srishti often ran around the countryside near their home in Arizona, dreaming of owning the very peculiar building theyd go past.Falcons Nest towers at over ft high and with  floors, is the tallest single-family home on the planet.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Magic is the focus on the inidual, rather than having to deal with God.”It encouraged “the belief that somehow the power is within them. Even within the world of exorcism, the premise would be that God is not a bystander, God is the main actor”.Lampert also said that everyone who wanted to receive this kind of help had to complete an assessment which is conducted by a medical professional.This form of assessment consequently ended most applications.After the death of Pope John Paul II in , the number of American priests trained to perform exorcisms rose from  to about  under Benedict.Now there are said to be over a hundred under Pope Francis.A historian of religion in American le at Auburn University in Alabama, Adam Jortner, mentioned that the influence of children’s books has frightened members of the church.He said: “The church had a go at CS Lewis for the Narnia books, a powerful allegory of Christianity itself. Harry Potter is responsible for mainstreaming magic.”He claims that exorcism was no stranger to the church, and consequently many respect it greatly.He added: “The Catholic church has some of the most stringent rules about exorcism in the world.“Most Catholic exorcists are required to go through this long list of things to ensure that it is not a neurological problem.”This is not the first time priests have pointed to commercialised factors, especially Harry Potter, for affecting exorcism.In , two of the Catholic Churchs top exorcists have revealed you could be giving the Devil access to your body - with drinking, using porn and watching Harry Potter all blamed for a recent rise in exorcisms.The unnamed priests told The Times that our obsession with all things supernatural and a decline inChristian practice has led to more and more people asking priests to exorcise demons from them or their homes.One of the priests, an exorcist in the archdiocese of Southwark, said: “It’s true to say there is a greater interest in exorcisms.There are lots of reasons. Popular culture is full of the preternatural. Young people are watching things about vampires and Harry Potter and, however much people claim to have moved away from mainstream religion, there remains the need to believe in something invisible.“It’s normal for humans to have a morbid fascination with the idea of a battle with evil and, to paint a caricature, the exorcist coming like a wizard to help.”"},{"url":null,"title":"rebecca adlington new boyfriend harry needs","story":"The two-time gold medallist has opened up for the first time about her relationship with -year-old property manager Andrew Parsons.She told OK!

Meghan is a believer in karma and she doesn’t want to sit there reading negative online stories and comments about herself.She feels to a degree the British press is out to get her and while she’s aware of the news and what’s going on, she tries her best not to read all the stories about her.Kensington Palace refused to comment on the latest in the bitter feud, but well-placed royal sources

the scenes.The falling out apparently dates back as far as last Christmas when the American TV star had complained that not all members of the royal family had made her feel welcome, leaving the couples at loggerheads.Charles tried to make her feel more at home by organising an invitation to Prince William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham, Anmer Hall, in an effort to help the couples bond.However, his plans fell apart, with a source telling the Mail that there was a “ghastly row” between the Sussexes and Cambridges.A senior Royal aide told the publication that the atmosphere at the country home soured because Meghan was considered by those present to have been “downright rude”.Another apparent reason for their rt was Meghan causing Kate to cry after a bridesmaid fitting for her daughter Charlotte.Meghan has also reportedly been sharp with her staff, including reducing her PA, Melissa Toubati, , to tears and ultimately leading to her handing in her resignation.Harry has also been throwing his weight around, angered that neither his brother or courtiers have been “rolling out the red carpet” for his bride.The brothers have always been incredibly close, but Harry and Meghan are setting up their home in the grounds of Windsor Castle.The Queen has given them Frogmore Cottage, which is having a multi-million pound refit paid for by the taxpayer.It will provide ten

reveal how a British-funded charity is on the front-line treating African wildle being speared and in most cases left for dead.Animals have been a frequent target of spear attacks as over the past  months, and charities have encountered numerous cases of such conflict in Kenya.Just a month ago, in these pictures from The David Sheldrick Wildle Trust , an elephant was found with a spear tip embedded cm into its skull.In another shocking example, a lion was incredibly lucky to escape being blinded after a two-metre spear was stabbed into his face.Working with rangers from the Masai Mara National Park, in Kenya, the DSWT and the Kenya Wildle Serviceare constantly trying to protect and help injured animals.In both these instances, the DSWT and KWS managed to sedate and treat the animals which incredibly each escaped without having any vital organs damaged.Over the past  months, the DSWT and KWS have encountered numerous cases of human-wildle conflict resulting from their territories over-lapping.Rob Brandford, Executive Director of the Trust said the five DSWT KWS Mobile Vet Units work in five important ecosystems across Kenya.He said: “In the Masai Mara, where this lion was treated, human-wildle conflictis a prevalent issue – as it is across Kenya – especially during the drier months when wildle leaves the national reserve and ventures into community land in search of food and water.“When this happens, predators may follow them and during this time, the Vet Units are called to more human-wildle conflict cases.“Our vets handle a wide iety of cases, though safe to say human-wildle conflict victims are on the rise.“Ever-expanding human populations mean something has to give, or be taken, and that is land formerly only utilised by wildle. This is something we are seeing worldwide, not only in Africa.”Brandford said in the elephant case the unit treating the elephant was the DSWT KWS Tsavo Veterinary Unit, headed by KWS Vet, Dr Poghon.He explained despite the deep impact of the spear tip, the skull makeup of the huge animal helped her survive the injury.He said: “If you took a cross section of an elephant’s skull it would appear like honeycomb.It is basically to reduce weight, because elephant skulls are so large, and need to be for the ears, trunk and of course tusks, they cannot be too heavy.“They have this sponge-like structure, and fortunately for this elephant, that is where the spear landed.“Of course, much deeper, or further down, could have been a dferent matter, hitting an eye for example.”Brandford added that the treatment of the elephant was a good example of persistence paying off.A lion was also on the receiving end of a spear attack a year ago, and these images show just how close it had come to death.As the lion lay on the ground sedated, a huge two-metre spear can be seen sticking out of his face just below the right eye.According to the DSWT, human-wildle conflict is one of the most pressing threats facing Africa’s wildle."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453588667.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"52ft christmas tree planted 40 years ago","story":"Avril Rowlands and her husband Christopher stuck a ft fir in their front garden after enjoying their first Christmas at their new home in .Now the tree towers above their four-bedroom detached house and the couple have to hire a cherry picker to decorate it using more than , lights.And on Sunday, the couple celebrated the monster firs th anniversary when they switched on the lights.It now illuminates the entire street where the couple live in Inkberrow, Worcs.Retired TV writer Avril, , said: The switch-on event has become an absolute institution for the village and we have hundreds of people see the tree.Weve even had tourists coming from as far as China to have their pictures taken by the tree.It is amazing to think that the tree started as a ft tall sapling which we bought for just £.I remember after that first Christmas thinking to myself that I didnt want to just throw the tree out so I planted it in the front garden.It took straight away and every year its just grown taller and taller.It now takes , to light the tree, I dont look at the electricity bill until after Christmas.The couple moved to the quiet village in the summer of  after selling their home in London.And their annual switch-on event has become a local institution which raises thousands of pounds for charity.Retired BBC editor Christopher, , said: A lot of people in the village say that its the start of their Christmas.We usually raise about £, a year for charity, a dferent one each year - this year all the money is going to the Midlands Air Ambulance.Over the last  years weve raised over £, for charity.Were delighted the tree has spread so much happiness and raised so much money.We expect itll be for many years to come.Inkberrow is one of a handful of villages in the country which doesnt have any street lights and the tree can be seen from a mile away at night when it is lit up.A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said: This is a remarkable tree which has obviously been taken care of.Pine trees can grow to huge heights so time will only tellthis one grows any larger."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453586368-e1543850306573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stunning secluded mansion with its own peninsula in devon goes on the market for 10m","story":"Gurrow Point, known as one of the finest homes in the south west,  is a s mansion that overlooks the glorious River Dart in Devon.Nestled near the village of Dittisham, the six-bedroom property has its own tennis courts, sauna and its own three-bedroom cottage on the grounds.The secluded home is ideal for water-loving families as it has two slipways and a jetty providing direct access to one of Britains best sailing estuaries.Unsurprisingly, the current owners rent their property out for weddings - allowing couples to say I do in the beautul surroundings.The property has been modied and extended over the years and now has , sq ft of accommodation.It has a reception hall, drawing room, sitting room, study, dining room, orangery, kitchen breakfast room, conservatory, library, billiard room, sauna, six bedrooms, five bathrooms and a two-bedroom staff flat which has its own entrance.There is also a triple garage and workshop, large barn, boules court and croquet lawn.Sarah-Jane Bingham-Chick, from Savills, said: This property takes your breath away.

What I can be clear on is that the consequence of the vote not going through next week would be uncertainty for business, uncertainty for jobs. Barclay also said the government would be working hard to get support for the vote.

More than half a million foodbank meals will be given to youngsters this Christmas, with families struggling more than ever due to Universal Credit. We believe it is a stain on our nation that children are still going hungry in the world’s fth biggest economy. So we are asking you to back our End Hunger, Feed a Family Christmas appeal. All the money raised will go to the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest provider of foodbanks. It desperately needs your support. The Trust wants money to pay for emergency food, help with storage costs and petrol for vans to deliver food parcels.  It is also seeking more volunteers to cope with the spiralling demand. Every penny you donate could help one less child go without a hot Christmas lunch, support a family which is destitute because of the five-week delay to UC, or put food on the table for someone who has been forced to choose between heating or eating. Research by the Trust has found families need foodbanks more in December than at any other time in the year. During the Christmas period, % of emergency parcels went to youngsters, with single parents especially reliant on the additional support. Emma Revie, the Trust’s chief executive, said: “No one in the UK should need to use a foodbank. This is about the kind of society we want to live in, the justice we want for each other. “It’s not right that during the last year we’ve seen soaring need for foodbanks across our network.  “It’s not right that this December, we’re expecting to see more emergency help needed than ever before. “And it’s not right that the benefits system we created to protect people from hunger is pushing people to our foodbanks.” She continued: “We want to reach a future where no one needs a foodbank, but we can’t get there alone. “That’s why we’re so grateful for the support of the Mirror in the lead-up to Christmas through the End Hunger, Feed a Family appeal. “Any support you can give will make a real dference. “We work with our foodbanks to provide emergency food, offer additional support and, crucially, campaign for long-term change. “Your donations will help ensure people in crisis right now can access the best possible support and bring us closer to a future where that help isn’t needed. “Rising foodbank use isn’t inevitable. We can end hunger and poverty. We’d love your support to reach a future where no one needs a foodbank.” People have to be referred to foodbanks by a professional such as a health visitor, school or social worker.  They are given a voucher that entitles them to a parcel, which contains enough nutritionally balanced, non-perishable food for three meals a day for three days. Many people are needing this help for the first time, such as Jodie Jennings and Rebecca Harrison, . The couple, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, are struggling to feed themselves and their six-month-old daughter. This is in part due to delays to jobseeker Rebecca’s benefit payments. Jodie, , said: “You feel so hopeless.” Volunteers at the Trust are expecting to dish out . million meals to starving families this Christmas. That is , more than last year. There was a % surge in demand at the Trust’s foodbanks last December compared with the rest of the year. The charity gave away , emergency parcels in the run-up to and over the festive period – a total of . million meals and a % increase from , when , parcels were handed out. Demand has already soared this year, with Trust experts blaming the UC rollout. Referrals caused by the five-week delay to payments have doubled in the last year, from % to %.

Yet each ministerial resignation and study costing the Brexit plan’s expensive disaster paints a picture of a clueless Noel Edmonds loser, Deluded of Downing Street signicantly less popular in this political jungle than she foolishly believes. To ask the nation to decide between her Brexit draft deal or remaining in the European Union would be bold, the only way to end the stalemate.

Geoffrey Cox QCs booming voice and dramatic delivery led to him being compared to, among others, Gandalf, Mufasa and Brian Blessed when he provided the warm up for the Prime Minister at Tory Conference. And today was certainly no dferent. The Governments chief legal adviser faced a stormy Commons as he defended the decision not to publish the Brexit legal advice in full, bellowing: There is nothing to see here. Political journalist Rob Hutton tweeted: The role of Geoffrey Cox will today be played by Tom Baker.journo Peter Walker commented: If an actor was asked to portray a stereotypical QC and did a Geoffrey Cox impersonation, theyd probably be told to tone it down a bit.  But, while political journalists enjoyed his theatrics at the dispatch box, Green MP Caroline Lucas was not impressed. She complained: This is a serious issue and this House is descending into farce and amateur dramatics. In a session replete with dramatic language, Mr Cox said that the Irish backstop would be as much an instrument of pain to the European Union as it would be to the United Kingdom. The Attorney General told the House: So there are real reasons that I dont think this will become a permanent solution. Labour said the Government was seeking to avoid the publication for fear of the political consequences, while DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds denounced the Irish border backstop plan as deeply unattractive, urged the Government to release the advice and told Mr Cox to recommend that the deal is rejected. Labour is leading calls for the government to face contempt of Parliament proceedings over their refusal to publish their Brexit legal advice. Today, a cross-party alliance has written to Speaker John Bercow, asking him to consider launching contempt proceedings against the Government for failing to release the Attorney General’s full legal advice on the Brexit deal as ordered by Parliament.  After Labours Harriet Harman raised concerns about the Governments approach, Mr Cox said he was caught in an acute clash of constitutional principle and explained a minister is obliged to consider the public and national interest. Mr Cox asked MPs to suppose the advice included details on relationships with foreign states and arguments that might be deployed in the future, noting: Would it be right for the Attorney General, regardless of the harm to the public interest, to ulge his opinion. I say toit wouldnt. Mr Cox said it would be dficult to ensure information would be redacted, adding: I cannot take a step that I firmly and truly believe would be contrary to the public interest. He went on: I ask the House to understand that it is only that consideration that is motivating me and this Government in declining at this stage to break the convention that applies to both sides of the House when they are in government. There is nothing to see here. Earlier, shadow attorney general Nick Thomas-Symonds said: For the sake of our economy, our jobs and our futures, all possible information should be made available to members of this House. The Government should do the right thing and make this full advice available, with so much at stake for all our constituents, with eight days to go before the vote on the deal, this House and this country deserves better from this Government. Conservative former minister Ken Clarke thanked the Attorney General for addressing paranoia and conspiracy theories around the Northern Ireland Protocol and providing a perfectly sensible solution to the border problem. Mr Cox responded: I make no bones about it - I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in this backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause to exitnegotiations had irretrievably broken down. But Im prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that were likely to be entrapped in it permanently. But Mr Dodds, arguing for the full legal advice, said: The overall context of this is as he has said a deeply unattractive, unsatisfactory presentation, and he needs to therefore, rather than recommend this agreement, needs to recommend that it be rejected. Mr Cox, in response to a question from Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve, later told MPs that even under the Northern Ireland backstop proposal checks might have to be carried out on a small number of products. He said: There would be regulatory ergence as there are within sovereign states throughout the world between one part of the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom and another. Those ergences could be kept to a minimum and they involve on my investigation some  forms of product in respect of which checks might have to be carried out at the border.  Those  forms of product are largely phytosanitary goods in respect of which in any event checks in many cases are already carried out at the ports of Northern Ireland. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, in reference to Mr Coxs earlier comment said there is something to see here. Tory former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab warned that whilst the Article  basis for the backstop is meant to be temporary it might well take some  years to be struck down by the European court. Mr Cox said that estimate was far too long but added it was impossible to say.

Dave Fletcher, , thought he had captured a tender childhood moment when he pictured daughter Izzy dozing off at a playground when she was -months-old. But just a few weeks later Dave and we Vicky, , were left devastated at the news their daughters tiredness was a symptom of leukaemia. Dave, an auditor, said he thought nothing of it when he snapped Izzy nodding off in the swing at a park near their home in Claines, Worcs. It was just an afternoon pop out to the swings. She was swinging away - I turned around and she had dropped off. She was drowsy and fell asleep but I didnt think much of it. I thought it was a cute moment and just took a picture of her as you do.  It was only afterwards we realised it was all part of the symptoms and what Id captured was her displaying signs of something more sinister, he said. The youngster has since undergone  doses of gruelling chemotherapy and is now receiving maintenance therapy in a bid to stop the cancer ing. Dad Dave is now warning other parents to be vigilant and look out for the tell-tale signs of the disease. She had been tired, had had a few colds or viruses, and quite a bit of bruising on her legs. But we put all this down to normal childhood bumps and minor illness. You get a bit sentimental, looking at pictures of her before she was ill - you just realise how much shes been through since at so young.  The couple first took Izzy to a GP in January last year after a strange rash appeared on her leg. They were advised to come back several days later for blood teststhe rash had not gone, and to take her straight to hospitalit got worse. However by the next morning, Izzys rash had spread and she then developed a temperature, so her parents took her to Worcester Royal Hospital. She was diagnosed with leukaemia the same day and began a course of chemotherapy the following week.Izzy spent her second birthday in Birmingham Childrens Hospital waiting to have a procedure to sample her bone marrow.  As part of her care, Izzy was enrolled on a clinical trial called UKALL  and will remain on treatment until May next year. This trial aims to seechanging the standard chemotherapy treatment will reduce side effects and help stop their disease from coming back. Dave added: She has grown up very quickly and been subjected to medicine she doesnt like but has taken everything in her stride so far. When she was diagnosed it came out of the blue. We were both in real shock as it happened so fast.It was a big unknown. A family member died of leukaemia five years ago, so it was a scary time. We didnt know what was going to happen at that stage or what the future held. But we were lucky Izzy was diagnosed quickly and lucky she has coped very well with the treatment, suffering very few setbacks or unplanned hospital admissions. The type of leukaemia she has has a better chance of recovery than some others. She is young which helps those odds. It makes us more optimistic. She doesnt have to have so many steroids because of the trial she is on.Its a treatment plan they use in other countries and we are grateful to be given the opportunity.It shows just how important research is in pioneering new treatments. The NHS doctors and nurses have been brilliant. and weve had lots of support from family and friends.  Brave Izzy has now received a Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens Star Award in recognition of what she has been through. Vicky, , an archivist, said: Izzy was so excited to receive her award. It was a nice positive experience that rewarded her for struggling on with her treatment. Jane Redman, spokesperson for Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens in Worcestershire, said: Cancer can have a devastating impact on their lives and many of those who survive may live with serious long-term side effects from their treatment. Our mission is to fund research to find new, better and kinder treatments for young cancer patients.

And according to royal expert Katie Nicholl it didnt end well, and one question left Wills fuming.  To play the game, the brave players take it in turns to say something they have never done. Everyone in the group who has done it must then down their drink. In her book The Making of a Royal Romance, she claims a source says: When it was Carlys turn to play she announced, Ive never dated two people in this room, knowing full well that William was the only one who had because Kate was sitting next to him. According to the friend, Wills shot a thunderous look at Carly after she made the comment. Speaking under his breath, he then said: I cant believe you just said that. Awks. The group were reportedly all in shock over the comment.  It seems Kate also wasnt impressed, and Katie claims she hasnt spoken to Carly since. While most of us probably cant imagine the Duchess downing a drink, Kate actually started an all-women drinking club during her university days. Before Kate and Williams engagement was announced, thereported: At university, Kate continued to grow in confidence. She co-founded a girls drinking society, annoyed that the old ones excluded women. However, none of her old pals or fellow club members remember her too drinking much - and they dont remember her ever getting drunk.

A poll of , parents revealed just one in  children has asked for a new bike or skateboard from Santa, and only one in  have requested rollerblades. Instead, consoles and games, Lego and smartphones are among the top items on children’s wish-lists. Kids obsession with high-tech gadgets is leaving parents fearing they will have a struggle on their hands trying to prise their children away from screens and get them outdoors. It also emerged seven in  mums and dads claim their little ones spend too much time indoors during the festive period. In fact, two thirds of parents polled by multi-sports retailer, Decathlon said their offspring will only really step outside to visit family over Christmas. One in  even admit that their children don’t venture out of the house at all for a week or more during the Christmas break. Peter Lazarus, cycling manager at Decathlon said: “It’s not uncommon for children to be inactive during the festive period. They have toys to play with, films to watch and games consoles – plenty to keep them entertained without braving the cold and dark. “Buying kids an outdoor gt like a bike can be a great way of getting them out in the fresh air over Christmas and setting them up for a more active year ahead. “A quick cycle around the park, an hour on a skateboard or a walk in the countryside will all help to tear children away from their screens while keeping fitness levels up.”  The research found the lure of new Christmas gts is one of the biggest reasons for children staying inside Computer games, iPads and the jam-packed schedule of Christmas TV are the most common distractions. Six in  parents said they have to encourage their children to step away from their screens over the festive period. And another  per cent have bought their children outdoor gts for Christmas in an attempt to get them out of the house. According to the study, the average child will spend just an hour and  minutes outside per day during the school Christmas holiday. Three in  youngsters will get  minutes or less of fresh air. But in comparison, three hours a day will be spent in front of the TV while another two-and-a-half hours will be devoted to playing on iPads, phones or computer games. Jack Shakespeare of ukactive Kids, a not-for-profit group of organisations that campaigns for better health, added: “Movement has been stripped out of our children’s lives, with Generation Inactive fed a staple diet of sofa play and screen time, while being starved of outdoor activities. “It is vital for the health and happiness of this generation that we find ways to get children active and social outside of term time – whether a festive family walk or opening up schools to offer activities during the holidays.” The poll, via OnePoll, also revealed nearly one third of children in the UK now don’t even own a bike, and over four in ten of those that do haven’t ridden it for more than a month.

But within a month, she had amassed more than , followers and now spends hours every day focusing on Ralphie’s account.   She credits the social media giant for giving her the opportunity to work from home as she earns enough from running the account alongside her own business Mummas Prints. After a slew of adoring comments on his photographs, she realised that her son could become an ‘influencer’, opening up chances to work with brands and companies. As a family, Stacey, Ralphie, and his dad Adam Waplington, , have enjoyed free trips to theme parks, posh meals and popular tourist highlights, including Peppa Pig World. She earns a salary from his posts which she says she spends on family days out and treats for her boy. On top of his income from Instagram, the tot, who turns two in December, also earns a salary from modelling for brands including Next, which is kept separately in his own bank account.   Stacey said: “I’ve worked really hard to achieve what we have achieved and everything I do is for Ralphie and his future. “If a photo of him in a tracksuit with snot running down his face and his hair is messy gets put on social media, that is not representative of the brands we are representing. “It sounds awful referring to him a brand because he is a human and a child but essentially, the name that we have created is a business. “And that’s what I’m trying to say to people when they bash me, this is a business. “It’s not dferent to me leaving the house at am and ing at pm but instead I have a job where Ralphie reaps the rewards and I get to spend all day with my son. “So our family aren’t allowed to post photos unless it’s a photo we’ve already posted or a photo I’ve approved. “And before I take any photographs, we’ll make sure his hair is brushed. It’s about giving him a bit of dignity, after all I wouldn’t post a photo of me not at my best!   “One lady had a go at me saying I was too busy taking photos of him posing as a model. “Well, he is a model. He’s represented by an agency, he does a lot of modelling and he’s worked with some really big names. “So yes, I do take photos where he looks lovely because he is!” Stacey makes sure she plans ahead so photos of Ralphie are strategically shared when they’re likely to receive the most attention. She says this includes posting photos at am when fellow frazzled parents are likely to be scrolling through their phone whilst their children keep them awake. Overall, Ralphie’s received more than  free outfits, as well as free bedroom furniture, free designer toys and eight prams sent by baby brands. And Stacey and Adam have received free meals including a lavish afternoon tea at Fortnum  Mason, treatments at salons and gts including a free set of luggage and a free kingsize mattress.   Stacey said: “We’ve been invited to days out at themes parks, we’ve been offered hotel stays, a furniture company gave us all of Ralphie’s bedroom furniture. “I’ve been sent handbags, suitcases, Hugo Boss designer clothes. We got a luggage set for all of us. “Ralphie is really lucky. All of his clothing comes from Forever Sewing, they sponsor his wardrobe, and we love working with small businesses. But his profile didnt become a viral sensation overnight, as Stacey says she spent months ensuring that regular daily uploads saw her gain followers. She says she works hard to portray the daily struggles of motherhood rather than presenting a le that many cannot relate too. However, the effort was worth it, as the mum says Ralphie earns up to pound per sponsored post. But while most fans praise the handsome toddler and are quick to praise Stacey for her hard work, others aren’t so quick to big the tot’s Instagram page up. In the past, she’s received messages accusing of neglecting her son in favour of taking photographs of him. Stacey said: ‘I definitely put on a front so when someone calls you a bad mum, it really does hurt me.   “I just think thatsomeone was doing what I do but wasn’t in the right frame of mind, I wonder what these Instagram trolls could do. “I think people don’t realise the nastiness of what they say and how it could affect someone.” Although she admits to having spent a lot of time on her phone, she insists that Ralphie never notices. She says: “It only take a split second to take a photograph and I do all the editing when he’s asleep or Adam is home. “There’s a lot of prep work. You can only photograph himhe’s in a good mood and he’s happy to play. “I never force him to sit still, I just snap him in the moment so he’s none the wiser and it’s just like any other mum capturing a photo.   “He’s at that age where we can explain to him what we’re doing. “Obviously its stressful because you have a brief from some brands to get it from a certain angle and just one shot to do it. “Once you set it up,he messes it all up, then you won’t get a good image. So we really do have to work as a team. “I’ve got Adam running around like a performing monkey distracting him but Ralphie just laughs and thinks its funny. “We’ve visited some great places and he’s actually having a lot of fun but for me, it’s like being at work, “So I’m filming, editing and doing Instagram stories on my phone and probably looking like I’m having the worst time. “So it’s not all it seems.” And as Ralphie’s following increases, Stacey says she understands why parents might criticise her. She said: “We’re exposing Ralphie to a le that’s he’s not had a choice in. He’s not been able to say ‘yes mummy’, I want to do this.   ‘Ultimately, we try and understand it from people with a negative opinion. “How we see it is, yes, there’s a lot of views and opinions on what we do and how we could be putting him in danger. “But at the same time, I know that everything we post is filtered and we want to portray him as the little boy having fun that he is. “I can see why people would think we are using him as a tool for potentially making a name for our family, and as a form of income but this isn’t the case. “But I post to inspire other people that you can achieve anything. I am an ordinary girl from a really ordinary background. “I’ve had ups and downs in my lives but I know you can achieve anythingyou work hard at it. “I feel really grateful to be given the opportunities that we have been given.” And as Ralphie gets older, brands are becoming more intrigued by the rest of the family, including Adam, who works in the wholesale restaurant business.   The pair recently set up an Instagram account focused on him and hope that he may be able to quit his full-time job in the future. Adam said: “I’m still really new to the whole thing. “We found that opportunities would come up that involved dads so we thought it was a no-brainerI got involved.” But Stacey says that she still spends a lot of time contacting brands to suggest they work with her. She said: “It’s like any business, You have to go out and get it. “I’d say seventy per cent of the work we obtain is through me reaching out to source it, and thirty per cent where we get contacted directly.” Now the -year-old has begun running workshops for fellow parents on how to use social media and promote their businesses or their own family influencer accounts. She said: “I’m so passionate about what I do “I think Instagram is quite misunderstood but it can be a really positive place to share your story. In the near future, the family hope to have another child who they can also share on Instagram. Stacey said: “Some of the companies that got in touch when Ralphie was  or  weeks old, we still are in contact with. “Unfortunately a lot of products only make things for newborns so we’re longing for baby two now so we can carry on!” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather up four inches","story":"NewsUK weather: Four inches of snow forecast for Britain as temperatures plungeTemperatures will plummet tonight following a week of mild weather with snow expected in north Wales, the Peak District and the PenninesShareCommentsByElaine McCahill:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video uk-weather-ice-warning-temperatures-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits are set to be hit by up to four inches of snow in the coming days as temperatures plunge this evening. The UK has been enjoying milder than average temperatures this week but that will all change tonight when the mercury drops to -C. It will be the coldest night of the year so far with snow affecting some areas from tomorrow evening. Most of the UK will wake up to a covering of frost on Tuesday morning, following the night of sub-zero temperatures. But north Wales, the Peak District and Pennines will be hit by snow from Tuesday evening.  Becky Mitchell, a meteorologist with the Met Office, told : There is a risk of hill snow from Tuesday evening and overnight until early Wednesday. Northern Wales, northern England will see some snow settling. We could see cm and possibly cm of snow on the highest Pennines. Although its been mild recently, its going to turn colder tomorrow. In the areas expecting snow, temperatures will be around C which isnt exceptionally cold but a band of rain is pushing up from the south and as it moves up into the colder air, thats where we could see a bit of snow on Tuesday night.  The Met Office has put a yellow warning in place for the Dumfries and Galloway areas of Scotland urging people to be aware of icy roads, pavements and cycle paths. After the steep drop in temperatures, the rest of the week looks unsettled across the UK. She added: From Wednesday afternoon onwards, were back to milder temperatures - were expecting double figures quite wildly across the country. But from Wednesday the weather will be quite unsettled - itll be wet and windy across most of the UK right through the weekend and into early next week.  Tonight Further showers are likely across some northern and western parts overnight, mainly on coasts and hills. Clear spells where, leading to a fairly widespread frost. Some fog patches are possible. Overnight lows from  to C are expected on the south coast with the mercury dropping to around freezing where. Coldest values will be felt in northern England and Scotland where temperatures could plunge as low as -C in the Highlands. Tuesday There will be some sunny or bright spells initially in the east, but otherwise, it will be a rather cloudy day as a band of rain pushes up from the south-west, perhaps bringing some hill snow to northern parts later. Much of Scotland will remain dry until evening, however, becoming windy later. Wednesday Wednesday, a wet and windy start for many, though it should become more settled later, with perhaps with some bright spells for western parts. Fine and cold over Scotland.

Catherine Englefield noticed bushes were trampled and someone had stamped on her late husband Maurices memorial. Shocked at the sight, Catherine, who is in her late s, was further horried when someone living near the cemetery told her she spotted two men having sex in the same spot one night. Mr Englefields ashes were scattered at the cemetery in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, in memory of where he was brought up and had lived for many years. The heartbroken widow said that the neighbour had reported the incident to police but no-one had been detained.It came after numerous complaints of anti-social behaviour - including drinking and late-night gatherings - in the cemetery, which is kept open at night so people can cut through. Mrs Englefield, an NHS worker who now lives in Aylesbury, Bucks., said: I thought it would be nice for Maurices friends and familyhis ashes were scattered in Chesham - it is where he was born and lived. But now I am wonderingI have made a mistake because some people have no morals. I was so upset when I arrived and saw all the broken bushes and it looked like someone had sat on or stamped on the memorial. When the neighbour told me what had happened I was devastated. There is just no respect. To me, a cemetery is a sacred place.  She is now calling for the cemetery gates to be locked at night in a bid to reduce the risk of antisocial behaviour - and has even involved her MP, David Lidington. She said: Anyone can go in there - andyoure going in there at night, it is not going to be for a nice reason. People pay their respects during the day.The council and police say they want to keep the gates open so people can cut through there but what about those who are affected by this bad behaviour  I never see a police officer there. Since my husband died I want to move back to France, but I cannot go until this is sorted out. Bill Reid, town clerk at Chesham Town Council, said the authority was aware of the issues with the cemetery and had made efforts to improve sight lines by cutting back hedges and removing benches where people had congregated for antisocial reasons. However, he said that police were keen for the cemetery to remain open at night and there were no immediate plans to lock it up at night.

Other expressions including killing two birds with one stone and flog a dead horse could also apparently go out of fashion. This is to avoid offending animal lovers, according to Shareena Hamzah of Swansea University. Animal rights charity Peta is also on board and wants people to replace sayings such as take the bull by the horns with take the flower by the thorns. Dr Hamzah believes that the influence of veganism will bring awareness of animal cruelty and encourage people towards using less meat-themed phrases.  She told The Conversation academic website: If veganism forces us to confront the realities of foods origins, then this increased awareness will undoubtedly be reflected in our language and literature.  The increased awareness of vegan issues will filter through our consciousness to produce new modes of expression. However Dr Hamzah adds it was unlikely such sayings would be removed completely, and using them less could even increase their impact.  She added: The image of killing two birds with one stone is,anything, made more powerful by the animal-friendly alternative of feeding two birds with one scone. Peta also hopes the phrase to flog a dead horse could be replaced with to feed a fed horse. Another alternative saying for more than one way to skin a cat could be more than one way to peel a potato, it said.

Emile Ratelband, who remains , argued that he felt far more youthful than his birth certicate implied, and asked this to be recognised legally. He also said his age limited his success on dating app Tinder, and said he should be allowed to be  again. However a district court in the Netherlands said this was not possible in a ruling today. Officials ruled that changing someones age would affect the legal responsibilities that come with the passing of time. In a ruling published online, the court said: The court did not find any reason in Mr Ratelband’s arguments to create new case law in line with the statutory provisions on changes to a person’s officially registered name or gender.  Its main reason was that, unlike the situation with respect to a change in registered name or gender, there are a iety of rights and duties related to age, such as the right to vote and the duty to attend school. If Mr Ratelband’s request was allowed, those age requirements would become meaningless. Mr Ratelbands case had been referred to a court in the city of Arnhmen in the eastern Dutch provice of Gelderland. He was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , . Mr Ratelband said: I have done a check-up and what does it show  My biological age is  years.  When Im , I am limited. If Im , then I can buy a new house, drive a dferent car. I can take up more work. When Im on Tinder and it say Im , I dont get an answer. When Im , with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position. Transgenders can now have their gender changed on their birth certicate, and in the same spirit there should be room for an age change. He claims he is discriminated against because of his age, and that he encounters problems in society on a daily basis. He said companies are reluctant to hire someone the age of a pensioner as a consultant. And he said his move would also be good news for the government as he would be renouncing his pension until he reaches retirement age again. The judge said that he had some sympathy with Mr Ratelband, but the court said there would be practical problems in allowing people to change their birth date - as it would mean legally deleting part of their lives.

That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone.

perimeter of the room rather than in the middle to “reduce their effect on any residual vibration”.Natalie Davidson, who used to live in the block and has submitted a claim to the council’s insurers,

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13664076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169410821.jpg","title":"cctv cameras blink another ayrshire","story":"NewsCCTV cameras on blink at ANOTHER Ayrshire hospital following stabbing at Ayrs AilsaThe Ayrshire Post can reveal that the Ailsa is not the only Ayrshire hospital where cameras are not recording.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsDetectives scour the scene at the Ailsa Hospital \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSecurity cameras at MORE than one Ayrshire hospital have gone dark, it can be revealed. It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

preferred the UK to be able to unilaterally terminate the backstop arrangement, while Theresa Mayrsquos chief Europe adviser Olly Robbins admitted the situation was ldquouncomfortable.The backstop is highly controversial, with Brexiteer MPs claiming it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The -page Legal Position On The Withdrawal Agreement was published after the Government lost a parliamentary vote calling for the full legal advice to be released.Opposition parties in the Commons ndash including Theresa Mayrsquos DUP allies ndash said the document and a statement by Mr Cox failed to meet the terms of the vote and asked Speaker John Bercow to launch contempt of Parliament proceedings.The row came after Theresa May told Tory MPs to ldquohold their nerve and back her Brexit deal, insisting she would still have a job in two weeksrsquo time as she faces a crunch December  Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement.The dense legalese paper states the backstop ldquoprotocol, which would take the whole of the UK into a customs arrangement with the EU to avoid a hard border with Ireland, would come into effect in December  unless an alternative measure was in place.The document said ldquoin the event that a subsequent agreement is not in place by then the ldquoprotocol will continue to apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole in or part, by a subsequent agreement establishing alternative arrangements.It goes on to say ldquo it does start to apply then it should do so only temporarily, with Mr Cox arguing the Article  process for leaving the EU does not allow a permanent arrangement to be put in place.Mr Cox acknowledged neither the UK nor the EU had the right to terminate the backstop agreement unilaterallyit came into effect, eventalks on a future trade deal to replace it broke down.ldquoI make no bones about it ndash I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in this backstop, he told MPs.He added: ldquoIrsquom prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that wersquore likely to be entrapped in it permanently.In a letter to the Speaker, signed by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and senior MPs from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party, the Government was accused of failing to comply with the vote ordering the publication of the advice.Sir Keir said: ldquoThe Government has failed to publish the Attorney Generalrsquos full and final legal advice to the Cabinet, as ordered by Parliament.ldquoWe have therefore been left with no option but to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt.Ive got a deal that delivers what people voted for.Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit vision. pic LkUbeInVmdash This Morning#December , Earlier, Mrs Mayrsquos chief Brexit adviser told MPs the border backstop was a ldquoslightly uncomfortable necessity for both the UK and the European Union.The fallback plan agreed with Brussels was ldquonot the future relationship that either the UK or the EU wants to have with one another, Mr Robbins told the Exiting the European Union Committee.He said: ldquoIt is an uncomfortable position for both sides and the reality hellip is that there is not a Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop.ldquoThat reflects also, as Irsquove said to this committee before, ministersrsquo commitments to Northern Ireland and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, rather than being something imposed upon us.ldquoSo, it is a necessity and a slightly uncomfortable necessity for both sides.Askedthe Government had drafted a clause for the Withdrawal Agreement that would have allowed the UK to opt out of the backstop unilaterally, Mr Robbins said: ldquoMinisters asked us to look at a whole range of options for how to bring the backstop to an end and so we did.ldquoAnd the Prime Minister and other ministers tested some of those out on European partners.ldquoBut, what we went into the negotiation with in the end was a text that delivered the termination clause very much as it is laid out there.The UK faces making additional payments to Brusselsthe Brexit implementation period is extended, the Governmentrsquos Brexit legal advice also said.Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, it is due to run until the end of December  but can be extended by up to two yearsboth sides agree.The advice says discussions on any extension would involve ldquoreaching further agreement

Apart from the obvious fact that the mention of the word Brexit sends most of us into a state of comatose anger delirium , this would be event TV at its most pointless.Unlike in the sort of debates wersquove become used to over the last few years, held before referendums and general elections - and indeed most of the shows it would replace in the schedules - no one other than the MPs watching would have a vote.Adding to the futility surrounding this set-up are the Brexit stances of the only two politicians invited to take part: barring a major change of heart, the positions being argued by Mrs May and Mr Corbyn would not only be similar, but similarly bad.The irony of all this is staggering. Here you have Mrs May, who voted Remain, trying to ram a terrible Brexit deal through Parliament that will, by her Governmentrsquos own admission, make the country poorer. This bleak halfway house leaves the UK worse off in every way, with no control or say over EU policy, having to align itself regardless, while losing all the benefits of the Single Market.Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, a lelong Eurosceptic who claims he voted Remain, has taken his party to a bizarre, opaque and convoluted position that also has us leaving the EU, despite knowing full well this will cause genuine and serious harm to the very people and public services he has spent his political le trying to protect from Tory policy. He agrees with Mrs May on ending free movement and leaving the Single Market, his only real ergence from her being the continual peddling of the fantasy that the EU would give him a far better deal than it gave her. Just because hersquos Jezza, you understand.In some ways, you can see why Mrs May, never a natural performer on this type of , would nevertheless want to take part in a debate. Donrsquot think for a minute itrsquos about persuading the public to support her deal ndash we have no say. No, as is usually the case with the Tories, this is all about selling it to a faction, in this case the grassroots party membership, who she wants to pressure their MPs to vote with, rather than against, her.As for Mr Corbyn, who in another striking similarity with the PM is also a poor public communicator, Irsquom still trying to work out what he thinks he can get out of this exposure.And thatrsquos whyI was Nicola Sturgeon, Irsquod stay well out of it and let these two lame ducks go it alone. For now, at least.The First Minister, who is not only an excellent debater but has a clear and cogent position on Brexit, says she wants in on the action, to put the case for staying in the Single Market and or having a so-called Peoplersquos Vote.Like many, I share her concerns around Scotland being deliberately left out of the process, as her lack of an invite to the debate only highlights. But I honestly donrsquot think she should waste her time with this one.If and when the Peoplersquos Vote, or even another general election is called, both of which are possible scenarios, her voice will be needed to persuade not only Scots, but arguably more importantly voters around the UK, that Brexit can and must be stopped or at least signicantly watered down. In that scenario she should not only debate Mrs May and Mr Corbyn but be ready to make her case against hard Brexiteers like Boris Johnson.Until a meaningful opportunity arises, however, Ms Sturgeon should keep her powder clean and let Mrs May and Mr Corbyn keep fighting the phony war."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105685.jpg?type=article-full","title":"david-mundell-to-tell-banks-that-brexit-deal-offers-clarity","story":"The Scottish Secretary will try to sell Theresa Mayrsquos deal at a briefing for Scotlandrsquos poundbn financial services sector in Edinburgh.:David Mundell faces cross-party calls to resignAmong the employers taking part will be RBS, Tesco Bank, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, KPMG, Pheonix Group, and CYBG, which owns Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money UK.Also attending is Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body representing Scotlandrsquos financial services industry, whose members employ more than , people.The SNP said Mr Mundell must be ldquocompletely deludedhe believed his own spin, and said Mrs Mayrsquos deal and political agreement offered only uncertainty on trade relations.SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: ldquoIf David Mundell is so confident in the Tory governmentrsquos dodgy deal, hersquoll put his neck on the line and resignit fails to pass through the Commons.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

We need a deal, we need an orderly exit from the EU and we need certainty.“Like business more generally – and I think the public – they want to see MPs reducing uncertainty, stopping chaos and further ision, concluding a deal and allowing business to move forward.”: Brexit: I’ll still have a job in two weeks, Theresa May insistsDismissing the possibility of renegotiating the deal, he said: “No deal is the most-likely alternative to there being a deal.“Anyone who votes against the deal is increasing the prospect of there being a no deal and I can’t understand how anyone can contemplate that given the disastrous impact it would have on Scotland.”Asked about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s calls for extending theof Article , Mr Mundell replied: “I don’t see any circumstances where Article  should be extended. It’s just extending the uncertainty, the ision and the confusion.“I can see quite clearly that’s something that would appeal to Nicola Sturgeon because she’s now promoting a no-deal scenario because she believes that chaos and ision is the best backdrop for having another independence referendum.”With pressure mounting on the Prime Minister ahead of next Tuesday’s vote, Mr Mundell refused to be drawn on whether Mrs May’s premiership would survivethe deal was rejected in Parliament.“Wider speculation isn’t in any way helpful,” he said. “It’s a big week, there’s going to be five full days of debate.“I’m confident, still, that we can get the deal through next week.”With eight days to go until the vote,  Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against Mrs May’s deal and  Tory MPs have said they will not vote in favour.

It has an historic treaty giving it clout within the British state.It has “the world’s most powerfully devolved parliament”. Supposedly.Yet the nation of Scotland has no distinctive say over Brexit at all. Not just in EU negotiations about the most important issue affecting Scots since the independence vote, in which we had total authority. But Scotland also has no presence in deciding what happens next, even though our First Minister has outlined the solutions suddenly discovered by others for two years and has visibly tried to coax common cause from Westminster parties who should have been doing that democratic donkey work themselves. We all understand Britain is a uniquely one-singer one-song kind of democracy, where supposedly powerful devolved legislatures have as little clout as the official opposition. But the determination to side-line Scottish input is fairly jaw-dropping. Former Tory Minister Nick Boles has come up with Norway Now - the wheeze staying in the customs union and single market. Wasn’t that the main proposal in the Scottish Government’s options paper published in December   Still, who cares. It’s a iant of everyday sexism “That’s a marvellous idea, Miss Sturgeon. I’m sure one of the men will have it presently.” Except Nicola Sturgeon’s air-brushing from the Brexit debate has little to do with her gender and everything to do with her nationality. • : Nicola Sturgeon heads to London in bid to force Brexit delayIt’s the same story with the forthcoming “Grand Brexit Debate” between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. An opinion poll suggests voters want more shades of opinion included than an hour’s face off between two supporters of similarly unworkable Brexit schemes.But the names proposed by commentators as “must have” supplements to the debate are Lib Dem Vince Cable, Green Caroline Lucas and the un-elected Nigel Farage. Apparently, the First Minister may be on a side  – but that’s it. Even though as deputy SNP leader Keith Brown points out “Up to six options for the UK’s future will be voted on in the Commons on December . To fully debate only the Prime Minister’s view and that of the leader of the opposition … would be a severe dereliction of the BBC’s public duty.”Well quite.But doubtless this is exactly what will happen. Which raises a few questions. Why are broadcasters are still intent on delivering a two-person debate despite their relative lack of disagreement and the complexity and importance of the subject Has the business of creating articially polarised debates become such an ingrained habit that broadcasters can do nothing  and believe voters are scared of options  Secondly, is it alright to sideline Britain’s third largest party  The BBC says SNP MPs don’t represent the whole of Britain. Why should that remove all broadcasting rights  Ukip doesn’t actually have any MPs, yet broadcasters will doubtless consider their inclusion because they want a good rammy. Somehow rules will be bent to include Ukip’s viewpoint, but not that of Nicola Sturgeon – although she is both the leader of Britain’s second largest party by membership and the First Minister of Scotland, representing the second largest nation within the UK. But her case for inclusion in formal debates regularly fails to find a champion on British TV. Wrong leaves on the democratic line, folks. Even though, this week the degree of democratic exclusion is set to heighten several notches.Not only will the House of Commons have a stand off over the government’s failure to publish legal guidance, but two other signicant things look set to happen.European judges in Luxembourg are set to rule on whether MPs can unilaterally vote to halt Article . This is a vital component of the People’s Vote, because drafting another referendum will need some time. The case is an excellent example of joint working between Scottish MPs, MSPs and Euro MPs from dferent parties but was begun by two legally minded parliamentarians – Joanna Cherry MP and Andy Wightman MSP. Yet I’ll be surprisedeither gets much airtime, eventheir case is upheld by European judges. The Scottish dimension just muddies the supposedly calm waters of British democracy too much. Even though this week will see another unprecedented outbreak of cross-party Scottish cooperation in Holyrood, where a joint statement from the four progressive parties will call for MSPs to reject both a no-deal Brexit and Theresa May’s compromise deal as “damaging for Scotland and the nations and regions of the UK”. In short, Scottish Labour and Lib Dems can go where their British counterparts fear to tread. Yet this move will probably get no network coverage at all.It seems Nicola Sturgeon could do the political equivalent of throwing herself under a horse at the Derby for the good of British voters and the news channels would hardly notice. This tells Scottish voters a lot about the reality of devolution. Power devolved has indeed turned out to be power retained by Westminster. The UK has turned out not to be a union but a unitary state, where devolved power is retrieved when convenient and no-one but the Conservative Partygets any say on major decisions over trade and foreign policy. I’ve lost count of the radio and TV discussions in which no question about Scotland’s response to Brexit is even raised. Yet voicing such an opinion sounds naïve at best and whining at worst. Meanwhile some broadcasters suggest the public is experiencing Brexit fatigue. Does this mean a terrible outcome must be tolerated simply because British parliamentary democracy has evaded, stupefied and bored the public into submission  We should beware these siren voices and remember Iraq where the voices of caution who wanted hard evidence of WMD were cast aside in the rush to action. There is still time to do better, but the role of Scots in formulating a rescue plan will never get the credit it deserves. Britain is essentially a unitary state, politically incapable of becoming anything . This is the reality of our constitutional position as revealed by the political stress-testing of Brexit. The question is whether Scots should sail on, regardless of the massive crack now visible,to shore and forget the escape attempt or look urgently for a brand new vessel. How the next few weeks are handled will have a massive impact in the forthcoming indyref debate.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837290.1543669277!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander s craig mcginlay on rugby acting and teamwork","story":"From blending with Beckham to hanging with Sam Heughan, the Scottish actor is on the moveCraig McGinlay is going places. He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything. I still have a long, long way to go and I’m very ambitious. If I quit my job to move into this, then I’m not in it for a laugh, I’m in it to go as far as I can.” Craig McGinlay can currently be seen in Season  of Outlander, available to watch now on Amazon Prime.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers.

On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

border backstop provision in the Brexit deal could continue indefinitely “unless and until it is superseded” by a new agreement, according to Government legal advice..pushThe position statement released on Monday also said the UK faces paying extra money to the European Unionthe implementation period after the March departure date has to be extended.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said he would have preferred the UK to be able to unilaterally terminate the backstop arrangement, while Theresa May’s chief Europe adviser Olly Robbins admitted the situation was “uncomfortable”.The backstop is highly controversial, with Brexiteer MPs claiming it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The -page Legal Position On The Withdrawal Agreement was published after the Government lost a parliamentary vote calling for the full legal advice to be released.Opposition parties in the Commons – including Theresa May’s DUP allies –  said the document and a statement by Mr Cox failed to meet the terms of the vote and asked Speaker John Bercow to launch contempt of Parliament proceedings.The row came after Theresa May told Tory MPs to “hold their nerve” and back her Brexit deal, insisting she would still have a job in two weeks’ time as she faces a crunch December  Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement.The dense legalese paper states the backstop “protocol”, which would take the whole of the UK into a customs arrangement with the EU to avoid a hard border with Ireland, would come into effect in December  unless an alternative measure was in place.The document said “in the event that a subsequent agreement is not in place by then” the “protocol will continue to apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole in or part, by a subsequent agreement establishing alternative arrangements”.It goes on to say “ it does start to apply then it should do so only temporarily”, with Mr Cox arguing the Article  process for leaving the EU does not allow a permanent arrangement to be put in place.Mr Cox acknowledged neither the UK nor the EU had the right to terminate the backstop agreement unilaterallyit came into effect, eventalks on a future trade deal to replace it broke down.“I make no bones about it – I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in this backstop,” he told MPs.He added: “I’m prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we’re likely to be entrapped in it permanently.”In a letter to the Speaker, signed by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and senior MPs from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party, the Government was accused of failing to comply with the vote ordering the publication of the advice.Sir Keir said: “The Government has failed to publish the Attorney General’s full and final legal advice to the Cabinet, as ordered by Parliament.“We have therefore been left with no option but to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt.”Ive got a deal that delivers what people voted for.Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit vision. pic LkUbeInV— This

However, growth was among the lowest recorded over the past two and a half years.The survey showed that the growth in new orders came primarily from the UK domestic market with new product launches and companies stockpiling ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union.But orders from overseas dropped for the second consecutive month in November, which IHS said was the first back-to-back contraction since early  as Brexit uncertainty took a toll on companies.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “The November PMI provided a lacklustre picture of the UK manufacturing sector, as ongoing global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty weighed on current business conditions and dampened the outlook for the year ahead.”He said the survey suggests manufacturing output is on course to make “no contribution to GDP growth in the final quarter, with a clear risk of output contracting unless December proves a stronger month”.“While demand from the domestic market was a positive spur, in some cases as clients built up stocks in response to Brexit and other supply-chain uncertainties, manufacturers also reported a further decrease in new export business as slower global economic growth and Brexit worries took a bite out of foreign demand.“Brexit worries also increasingly dominated the outlook for the sector. Although still forecasting growth for the year ahead, manufacturers’ confidence fell to its lowest ebb since August .”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, with overseas demand fragile, the manufacturing sector “does not have a buffer to withstand any lurch down in the domestic economy caused either by a no-deal Brexit or intensying fears that this worst case might happen”."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37580704.ece/43a49/AUTOCROP/w620h342/supppic3.jpg","title":"dups foster could be open to norway plus deal to satisfy dups red line on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

Last year five pupils were retained and this term eight were held back.The practice was put under the microscope by the Education Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee recently when a committee member asked for it to be discontinued.Mr J Scott said he was concerned that all children should have equal opportunities and that no pupils should have an advantage over othersCROSSGAR mdash The threat of closure that has been overshadowing the future of Crossgar War Memorial Hall was lted at a special public meeting. Over  local residents rallied in response to a desperate plea for help issued by the hallrsquos management committee.Lack of support and use of the hall forced the committee to present an ultimatums to the townsfolk to either take an interest in the hall, or have it closed down.This unprecedented appeal certainly produced results as Mr W J Cochrane said when he addressed a packed meeting.ldquoI am delighted to see so many people here, he said. ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet. It is vitally important that the hall is managed by a thoughtful and inventive committee to ensure a safe passage out of our present dficulties.ldquoUnless the committee can come up with ways of obtaining sustained financial assistance, the threat of closure is still real.Mr Cochrane explained that while many repairs had been carried out, there was still a lot to do.

Apart from completing the popular Myles Stone Diary each week in the Down Recorder, he finds time to continue his work writing radio plays.KILLINCHY mdash Plans to build a new primary school in Killinchy are to go ahead quickly mdash despite mounting objections from local residents.The new school will mean the closure of nearby Ballydrain Primary School and is to be built on a site which is causing anxiety in one of the villagersquos housing estates.The residents of Ardview Park have petitioned the South Eastern Education and Library Board about the new site because they are worried about two proposed entrances.The Board met this week to decide finally on a problem that has held back a decision for several months and agreed to proceed with the development.Mr Jack Magee, a Board member from Downpatrick, said there would be some annoyance during building operations, but when work is completed there should be no cause for complaint.A Board officer pointed out that there was no compulsion on the children to to transfer to a particular school and that many of them might to go Andrews Memorial School in Comber rather than Killlinchy.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The curtain will lt on Friday night on the opera lsquoCinderalla in Salernorsquo in Assumption Grammar School.The opera, which will also be staged on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday, is being put on by pupils at the school with Miss S OrsquoHanlon and Miss M Scullion the producers.PORTAFERRY mdash Declan Mackell, the yachtsman who sailed into Portaferry at the end of his triumphant lone Atlantic crossing, plans to set off next year on a round the world trip.Declan estimates the voyage will take two years and when it is over he hopes to set up home in Portaferry.Declan intends to leave Portaferry is his -feet long yacht and head to France.

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

March departure date has to be extended.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said he would have preferred the UK to be able to unilaterally terminate the backstop arrangement, while Theresa Mayrsquos chief Europe adviser Olly Robbins admitted the situation was ldquouncomfortable.The backstop is highly controversial, with Brexiteer MPs claiming it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The -page Legal Position On The Withdrawal Agreement was published after the Government lost a parliamentary vote calling for the full legal advice to be released.Opposition parties in the Commons ndash including Theresa Mayrsquos DUP allies ndash said the document and a statement by Mr Cox failed to meet the terms of the vote and asked Speaker John Bercow to launch contempt of Parliament proceedings.The row came after Theresa May told Tory MPs to ldquohold their nerve and back her Brexit deal, insisting she would still have a job in two weeksrsquo time as she faces a crunch December  Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement.The dense legalese paper states the backstop ldquoprotocol, which would take the whole of the UK into a customs arrangement with the EU to avoid a hard border with Ireland, would come into effect in December  unless an alternative measure was in place.The document said ldquoin the event that a subsequent agreement is not in place by then the ldquoprotocol will continue to apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole in or part, by a subsequent agreement establishing alternative arrangements.It goes on to say ldquo it does start to apply then it should do so only temporarily, with Mr Cox arguing the Article  process for leaving the EU does not allow a permanent arrangement to be put in place.Mr Cox acknowledged neither the UK nor the EU had the right to terminate the backstop agreement unilaterallyit came into effect, eventalks on a future trade deal to replace it broke down.ldquoI make no bones about it ndash I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in this backstop, he told MPs.He added: ldquoIrsquom prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that wersquore likely to be entrapped in it permanently.In a letter to the Speaker, signed by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and senior MPs from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party, the Government was accused of failing to comply with the vote ordering the publication of the advice.Sir Keir said: ldquoThe Government has failed to publish the Attorney Generalrsquos full and final legal advice to the Cabinet, as ordered by Parliament.ldquoWe have therefore been left with no option but to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt.Ive got a deal that delivers what people voted for.Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit vision. pic LkUbeInVmdash This Morning#December , Earlier, Mrs Mayrsquos chief Brexit adviser told MPs the border backstop was a ldquoslightly uncomfortable necessity for both the UK and the European Union.The fallback plan agreed with Brussels was ldquonot the future relationship that either the UK or the EU wants to have with one another, Mr Robbins told the Exiting the European Union Committee.He said: ldquoIt is an uncomfortable position for both sides and the reality hellip is that there is not a Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop.ldquoThat reflects also, as Irsquove said to this committee before, ministersrsquo commitments to Northern Ireland and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, rather than being something imposed upon us.ldquoSo, it is a necessity and a slightly uncomfortable necessity for both sides.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclayand Olly Robbins give evidence before the Exiting the European Union Committee Askedthe Government had drafted a clause for the Withdrawal Agreement that would have allowed the UK to opt out of the backstop unilaterally, Mr Robbins said: ldquoMinisters asked us to look at a whole range of options for how to bring the backstop to an end and so we did.ldquoAnd the Prime Minister and other ministers tested some of those out on European partners.ldquoBut, what we went into the negotiation with in the end was a text that delivered the termination clause very much as it is laid out there.The UK faces making additional payments to Brusselsthe Brexit implementation period is extended, the Governmentrsquos Brexit legal advice also said.Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, it is due to run until the end of December  but can be extended by up to two yearsboth sides agree.The advice says discussions on any extension would involve ldquoreaching further agreement on the

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table.
