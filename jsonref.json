By the time Meghan had become a senior royal, the pair were still no closer than before the 2018. According to one source, Meghan was disappointed that they hadn\u0027t bonded, but was not losing sleep over it.    The book also details one awkward moment at Kensington Palace in 2017 when Kate went alone in her Range Rover while shopping - despite  the fact Meghan was also going to the same street. Though some aides claimed the sisters-in-law \u0027talked and texted regularly\u0027, they had barely spent any time together by the time of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.  The book also reveals how Meghan regarded some commentary and tabloid stories as \u0027sexist\u0027 and \u0027prejudiced\u0027, with ambitious women of colour like her labelled \u0027demanding and aggressive\u0027.  A close friend of Meghan\u0027s told the authors: \u0027Duchess Different. That\u0027s what people have a problem with.

And none were designed specifically to look at risk compensation.The researchers found three studies, none of which had been peer reviewed, that assessed the effect of mask wearing on the behaviour of others around them.All showed that people moved away from those wearing a mask, which in theory would be a move to protect them from catching the virus.  The paper said that the idea of risk compensation used as an argument to discourage the wearing of face masks was \u0027unfounded\u0027. Experts may say that an intervention that causes people to relax their other control measures is worse than promoting it.\u0027There is, however, no compelling evidence that such risk compensation exists at a population level,\u0027 Professor Marteau and colleagues wrote.Instead, wearing a face mask could do the opposite and drive people to uptake other associated behaviours, like handwashing, because it acts as a cue to remind people of the risk of the coronavirus.The team backed their claims that risk compensation does not exist by looking at other realms of health, finding weak evidence.For example, being vaccinated against HPV, a group of viruses passed through sex, was not found to lead to riskier sexual activity.  The researchers concluded: \u0027Evidence is growing that wearing face covering reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the limited evidence available does not support concerns that their use adversely affects hand hygiene.\u0027In 2016, Pless (Barry Pless, a scientist at McGill University in Canada) argued that risk compensation theory is a dead horse that no longer needs to be beaten. \u0027We would add that this dead horse now needs burying to try to prevent the continued threat it poses through slowing the adoption of effective public health interventions.\u0027But other experts disagreed and pointed out that evidence in this area was still limited.Susan Michie, a health psychologist at University College London, told The Telegraph: \u0027The authors rightly point to evidence that risk compensation is not a universal phenomenon but, as they themselves recognise, there may be contexts in which it can occur. \u0027So the idea of burying it is as potentially dangerous as assuming that it will occur.\u0027 Robert Dingwall, a social scientist at Nottingham Trent University, said: \u0027The authors do us all a service by bringing together a body of work in a convenient form. \u0027Merely piling up fragile evidence does not, though, necessarily make it any stronger.\u0027    "},{"url":null,"title":"Man tries snatch two year old girl childrens play park","story":"Share this article He said: \u0027Understandably, this incident has caused anxiety and upset to those involved and no doubt this news will cause further concern amongst the local community - at this stage of our investigation we are keeping an open mind as to what the man\u0027s intentions may have been. \u0027It is possible that there may be an innocent explanation to this and if that is the case, we would still like to speak to the man involved to understand exactly what this was.

It had previously expected GDP to match fourth-quarter 2019 size in early 2023.However, the UK is only slowly emerging from the Covid-19 lockdown, with gyms and swimming pools reopening at the weekend. Non-essential shops were allowed to re-open from 15 June and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers from 4 July.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: “Even though lockdown restrictions are easing, consumer caution has been much more pronounced than expected. We believe that consumer confidence is one of three key factors likely to weigh on the UK economy over the rest of the year, alongside the impact of rising unemployment and low levels of business investment.“The UK economy may be past its low point but it is looking increasingly likely that the climb back is going to be a lot longer than expected. May’s growth undershot even the lowest forecasts. By the middle of this year, the economy was a fifth smaller than it was at the start. Such a fall creates more room for rapid growth later, but it will be from a much lower base.”“The labour market’s performance is key to the economy’s prospects over both the short term and further out,” Archer said. “Job losses and poor real wage growth are expected to hold back consumer spending … It is possible that the chancellor will look to provide further help for the labour market in this autumn’s budget.”Mark Gregory, EY UK’s chief economist, said: “Government measures have provided significant short-term support, but many businesses are waiting for more certainty over the economic outlook before making longer term investment decisions.“Policies such as VAT cuts are welcome, but they aren’t a complete solution, as they don’t resolve the concerns consumers may have about going to restaurants and bars in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4d80986c1eeee881a9b2a191cfac0c68ca49ee/0_179_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=90087dbe4ef47e7101d71a150032e43c","title":"uk lockdown pandemic slashed income","story":"The pandemic has slashed many people’s income. A fragile sense of togetherness is quickly coming apartWe all realised early on that the end of lockdown would be an anti-climax. There was never going to be one triumphant day when everything turned out fine. But now that the pubs have opened again and the Zoom quizzes have tailed off, it has turned out to be even more deflating than anyone could have expected. We’ve returned to reality-but-slightly-worse, a mundane dystopia where every activity is slightly less convenient and every decision weighted with moral ambiguity. For people who are still shielding, meanwhile, lockdown hasn’t ended at all. This disrupts the narrative that everything is fine now, so mostly isn’t talked about.The country is returning to normality at a much faster rate than many of our bank balances. I’m not quite unemployed but the pandemic has decimated my income. With the industry I work in floundering and the country potentially heading into a worse recession than any other country in the world, there’s little hope of this changing any time soon. The government calling on the country to go out and spend, to “Eat out to help out”, is yet another example of how disconnected the Conservative party is from most of the country. Especially from the class of young people whose income is swallowed up by rent and debt.However ambivalent I feel about the restrictions easing, I’m not nostalgic for lockdown. I started out determined to be productive, harbouring fantasies of learning Arabic on Duolingo, writing a book, and spending languid afternoons reading the complete works of Edith Wharton beneath a tree. But faced with a presumably unrepeatable opportunity for self-improvement, I mostly spent it watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and getting into arguments on Twitter. Every Sunday, when my weekly screen-time report arrived on my phone, I would gasp in horror. Lockdown was a test I failed.But it was at least straightforward. It was cheap, for a start, and easy enough to scrape by with little money. There was no fear of missing out on the expensive thrills of city life, because nothing was happening. Even losing work felt like a communal experience rather than an inidual failing. If you weren’t a key worker, lockdown was a cocoon-like state of suspension. Now that it’s over, the reality we’re entering only draws out more sharply the inequalities we had all got used to. Some people are jetting off on foreign holidays or renting quaint little cottages in the Quantocks, but for the millions of people now out of work, this stage could mark the start of something worse.It sounds glib to complain about Fomo, but being too broke to socialise can be brutally lonely. At least in summertime it’s affordable to have fun. If you live near a park and can rustle up five pounds for a four-pack of cans then you’re sorted. But as winter draws in and people begin to congregate in bars and restaurants, that fiver isn’t going to cut it. Come December, I can see myself scrolling through my friend’s Instagram stories and looking back fondly at the time when I wasn’t the only person stuck inside. Of course this isn’t a new problem: there have always been disparities in leisure time and disposable income some people have always been on the outside looking in. But these isions are becoming starker than ever, cropping up within families and friendship groups, with some industries collapsing and others holding up. New inequalities have emerged and those that already existed have been exacerbated.Up until last year, I worked in hospitality. I mostly enjoyed this, and even after I quit it was comforting to know I could always go back. In pre-Covid-19 London, finding a bar job was easy, which meant you could always feel confident in your ability to pay your rent. Not any more. Across the industry there have been mass redundancies and venues are closing. People are applying for service jobs and finding themselves one of hundreds of applicants, while those who haven’t been laid off yet face an uncertain future. The era of sauntering into your local pub, handing in a CV and getting a trial shift the next day is over. Bar work often pays badly and offers little in the way of employment rights, but, however easy it was to get fired, it was equally easy to find a new job. The fact this is no longer the case adds an extra level of precarity to the economy, particularly for young people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72df07b52513a6f6c2f7e8091ac825af93669f8e/0_124_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ca5fd4f5c5cd7a3496ef4d5c4988c80","title":"solved whats the optimum number of series for a sitcom","story":"This week we try to pinpoint the TV comedy sweet spot, where ‘sharp and consistent’ has yet to become ‘laboured and cliched’There is a widespread misconception that the classic two-series sitcom – Fawlty Towers, The Office, Fleabag – is national character in action. British writers show restraint and an unerring sense of moderation, which, it is argued, contrasts with the wild excesses of the American temperament. How else to explain 12 seasons of Two and a Half Men, plus 18 (and counting) of Family Guy? American sitcoms, like American soda servings, are oversized to the point of absurdity.What this analysis fails to consider, however, is a more practical difference in TV production methods. Over there, sitcoms typically have whole writers’ rooms, stocked with young, energetic staff and delicious snacks, including – it’s rumoured – three varieties of M\u0026ampMs. Over here, sitcoms are written by one or, at most, two people, who churn out every single episode all by themselves in a windowless basement office, while waiting for their agent to call them back about this year’s Edinburgh schedule. (Spoiler: she never does.) UK comedy writers are not admirably restrained they’re just very, very tired.Shows such as It’s Only Sunny in Philadelphia (recently renewed for a 15th series) demonstrate that it’s possible for a sitcom to stay sharp beyond season two. Possible, but – for fundamental, structural reasons – not very common. Unlike a long-running drama, which will involve multiple, nuanced story arcs, a traditional sitcom “resets” at the beginning of each episode. Dumb characters stay dumb, mean characters stay mean, and cute kids are never, ever allowed to start puberty. The “sit” remains the same it must, for therein lies the “com”.This is also the crux of the dilemma for any writer with form-fiddling ambitions: change things too much and you risk alienating your audience don’t change things at all and you risk boring them. Some do pull off this fine balance of spiritual growth and cynical stasis, but even then there is a limit. And that limit is usually reached somewhere in the danger zone between series six and nine. That’s where good but relatively long shows such as Seinfeld, Peep Show, Dad’s Army and Steptoe and Son all wisely wound up their operations.Can we be more precise? Yes, we can. Series six is when will-they-won’t-they Jim and Pam finally tied the knot in the US version of The Office when Parks and Recreation foolishly followed star Chris Pratt to London. Series eight is when Will \u0026amp Grace started overdosing on lame guest stars when Woody got serious with his boring fiancee Kelly in Cheers and Modern Family started lazily leaning into the same stereotypes it had once challenged, via Jay’s new black neighbours. Series nine is when the Conners won the lottery in Roseanne Principal Skinner was unmasked as an imposter in The Simpsons and supposed “Friends” Joey and Rachel had their (basically) incestuous first kiss.Collate the data, pinpoint the exact moment of shark-jump, calculate an average, and there you have it: next time you’re enjoying a funny box set, remember to reach for the remote and switch off exactly 16 minutes and 34 seconds into the third episode of the seventh season. It is only going to get worse from there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

The centre is backed by government research grants and industry partners including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis.The catenary cables, powered by the national electricity grid, would link to lorries driving in the inside lanes on 4,300 miles (7,000km) of UK roads through an extendable rig known as a pantograph – similar to those on the top of electric trains. The electricity would power the lorry’s electric motor, as well as recharging an onboard electric battery that would power them to their destinations beyond the electrified roads.The engineering company Siemens and the lorrymaker Scania have already carried out extensive tests of e-highway electric road systems in Germany, Sweden and the US.Officials from the UK’s Department for Transport were scheduled to visit the test sites in Germany in March, but the trip was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.Battery-powered electric lorries and vans are already viable options for the short-range deliveries in urban areas that make up about a third of road freight usage. However, the other two-thirds – long-haul deliveries by lorries – are difficult to decarbonise because of range and weight requirements. The lithium ion batteries used in electric cars do not currently have a high enough energy density to be viable for long-distance haulage, meaning trucks such as Tesla’s planned Semi could require tonnes of batteries, denting their efficiency and raising their cost.In contrast, a lorry fitted for electric roads would only require a battery of similar size to an existing Tesla car to be able to cover the vast majority of the UK, according to David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University who co-authored the study.Multiple lorrymakers are developing lorries running on hydrogen fuel cells, but the authors of the study argue that “green” hydrogen trucks would use three times more energy than an electric road system. This is because energy is lost at every conversion: using solar energy to make hydrogen and then a fuel cell to generate electricity again.The electric road system would also have a major advantage over alternatives in that it would be possible to tax the electricity used by lorries, enabling the government to easily replace revenues lost from taxing diesel fuel, the report said.The report suggests that a first phase of building work on the busiest roads could take two years, costing £5.6bn. However, electrifying those most popular routes alone would cover almost a third of the miles travelled by heavy goods vehicles in the UK. Later stages would bring the total cost to £19.3bn.Lower energy costs are predicted to pay back vehicle operators for the investment in new vehicles within 18 months, while electrification infrastructure could pay back its investors – either government or private – within 15 years, the report said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23be95eccdfb70a79b29cbfd64e784174afa369/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ea822f60b6c247d21c6e04d8b58f45","title":"revealed new evidence links brazil meat giant jbs to amazon deforestation","story":"Photographs by employee appear to show company trucks being used to transport cattle from allegedly prohibited cattle farmNew evidence appears to connect JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, to cattle supplied from a farm in the Brazilian Amazon which is under sanction for illegal deforestation.This is the fifth time in a year that allegations have surfaced connecting the company to Amazon farmers linked with illegal deforestation. Brazilian beef companies have repeatedly claimed that the biggest challenge to keeping deforestation out of their supply chains is the “indirect suppliers” – farms where cattle are birthed, or which sell to farms where cattle are fattened, which then sell on to other farms or to slaughterhouses. JBS and other major beef firms Minerva and Marfrig all say that although they closely monitor their direct suppliers – the farms that supply slaughterhouses directly – they cannot be sure that there is no deforestation further up the supply chain because they cannot monitor indirect suppliers.But a joint investigation by Réporter Brasil, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the  has uncovered photographs taken by a JBS truck driver last summer which appear to show him transporting cattle from a farm with land under embargo after a deforestation fine, to a “clean” farm which then sold cattle on to JBS. These appear to indicate that JBS is in contact with at least one indirect supplier who has been sanctioned for deforestation. Whilst JBS has disputed the allegations, the evidence raises serious questions about JBS’s review of its own complex supply chain, at a time when the Brazilian government is being taken to task by international investors over rising deforestation and fires.The company has already been alleged to have been buying cattle from indirect suppliers linked to environmental offences, deforestation and other crimes in the Amazon four times in just over a year in investigations by the , the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Réporter Brasil, and Greenpeace and Amnesty International.This time, the apparent link between an indirect supplier and JBS was inadvertently revealed by one of its own employees. In July last year, a truck driver took photographs of himself in his JBS uniform, and of his JBS truck, by a sign marked “Fazenda Estrela do Aripuanã – 15km” at the southern end of the Amazon rainforest. Fazenda Estrela do Aripuanã is a farm near the town of Aripuanã, in the north-west of Mato Grosso state, operated by Ronaldo Venceslau Rodrigues da Cunha. His company, according to its website, currently breeds and fattens 102,000 cattle across 16 sites ning some 72,000 hectares of pasture.Da Cunha was fined R2.2m (£340,000) in 2012 for deforestation of rainforest on land at Aripuanã. Records published by Brazil’s environment agency Ibama show 1,455 hectares of land placed under an official embargo – which prohibits cattle grazing – as a result of the deforestation. Embargoes are imposed for environmental violations and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover.The investigation also found that the Aripuanã farm was ravaged by multiple forest fires between 2018 and 2019 by cross-referencing datasets with maps showing the farm’s boundaries. Da Cunha was asked to comment but did not respond.According to the truck driver’s Facebook posts at the time, he and other drivers were collecting cattle for JBS from the Aripuanã farm and trucking them to a second farm run by Da Cunha, Fazenda Estrela do Sangue, just 300km south.The Sangue farm has not been subject to embargoes so on paper would be seen as a “clean” supplier under JBS’s sourcing protocols.Although the driver’s Facebook posts detail just one journey between the two farms, cattle are regularly transported from the Aripuanã farm to Sangue.Cattle movement records show that from June 2018 to August 2019, at least 7,000 animals were dispatched from the first farm to the second. Separate records reveal Sangue farm sent some 7,000 cattle to JBS abattoirs in Juína and Juara in Mato Grosso between November 2018 and November 2019.Further posts by the driver appear to show him trucking cattle between different farms, rather than from farms to an abattoir. These routes between multiple farms as well as abattoirs have been described as “three-legged journeys” by JBS executives in interviews, and appear to be standard operating procedure for the company.They added: “JBS is working closely with national and local government departments to develop solutions and system improvements around supply chain traceability and best agricultural practice to eradicate deforestation. The interests of all stakeholders are aligned on this topic.”The company has been working for some time on improving its monitoring systems, and has just brought a new system into use.“As you know the ‘theoretical index’ of livestock productivity was implemented on 1 July 2020 and is expected to make a significant impact in the reduction of cattle laundering. With new tools such as this, and the active development of other initiatives we are collaborating on with our stakeholders, we are working towards a completely transparent supply chain.”JBS said its “theoretical index” has “already identified cases which are under investigation”. It is also working on a “green” version of cattle movement records with Brazil’s agriculture ministry that would show the environmental status of supplying farms. These would be automatically cross-referenced with lists of embargoed farms. Last year the company said it had been discussing this plan with the ministry since 2014.“JBS’s direct suppliers would be able to verify in a very simple and cost-free way the environmental status of the company’s indirect suppliers,” it said. “Tracing of the whole meat supply chain, although a complex task, could be achieved in the medium term.”Exports of Brazilian beef by the country’s three meat giants – JBS, Minerva and Marfrig – have risen significantly over the last three years, and are found in British and European supermarkets.“All over Europe there is a cattle tracing system so that people know where calves are born and they can be traced through their lives,” said British MP Angus MacNeil. “Brazil needs to clean up its act with regards to cattle traceability or surely nations will have to act in the face of such potential flagrant violations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a83356eeeeea2d1bc752d6cb474a30d018f7df/40_194_4921_2952/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4046e2b76ffad880ea267619f9d831ae","title":"uk electricity grids carbon emissions could turn negative by 2033 says national grid","story":"Operator says UK can tap carbon capture and renewables to help meet UK’s targetsCarbon emissions from Britain’s electricity system could turn negative by as early as 2033 if the UK uses carbon capture technology alongside more renewable energy to reach its climate targets, according to a report from National Grid.The electricity network operator on Monday set out its vision for an “emissions negative” grid that would include 30m electric vehicles on UK roads, and 8m heat pumps used to replace gas boilers in energy-efficient homes.In National Grid’s most progressive vision for Britain’s pathway towards its 2050 climate targets it claims that net carbon emissions from the electricity sector could turn negative within 13 years by using carbon capture technology alongside bioenergy sources.Mark Herring, the head of strategy at National Grid ESO, said three of the report’s four most-credible pathwaysto a net-zero economy by 2050 meant relying heavily on low-carbon electricity.National Grid expects a boom in renewable energy projects, including at least 3GW of new windpower capacity and 1.4GW of solar generation every year from now until 2050, alongside a widespread rollout of electric vehicles, which will effectively act as smart-charging “batteries” to help balance the electricity grid.It also expects a revolution in consumer energy use, including significantly better energy efficiency and the end of gas boilers. Instead, millions of homes will consume less than a third of the energy used today, and will rely on heat pumps fitted with thermal “heat batteries”.“Across all scenarios, we see growth in renewable energy generation, including significant expansion in installed offshore wind capacity. There is widespread uptake in domestic electric vehicles, and growth and investment in hydrogen and carbon capture technologies too,” Herring said.“Although these are not firm predictions, we’ve talked to over 600 industry experts to build this insight and it’s clear while net zero is achievable, there are significant changes ahead,” he added.The report warned that the UK will not meet its legally binding ambition to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 without “immediate action” from the government on key energy policies, and the negative emissions from bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage.Bioenergy is considered by many to be carbon neutral because the emissions produced from burning wood pellets in a power plant is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by sustainably managed forests when the trees are growing.The “carbon accounting” is, however, disputed by some academics and environmentalists.Carbon capture is also expected to play a major role in removing the greenhouse gases from North Sea gas to produce clean-burning hydrogen for Britain’s factories, steel works and power plants. This could mean that by 2035 the amount of gas burned to produce electricity without carbon capture technology may halve, according to National Grid.Herring said that it was too soon to determine the impact of the coronavirus crisis on Britain’s energy future, but many are hopeful that the pandemic may hasten the UK’s climate ambitions by using government stimulus packages for clean energy and energy efficiency measures to spur a green economic recovery.“While Covid-19 came too late to be factored into this year’s analysis many of the areas highlighted will be crucial in a green recovery from the pandemic, particularly improving energy efficiency across all sectors and significant investment in low carbon electricity generation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bdb5920fd0c5510f2ab5be1d149db68d21368b4/0_0_4832_2900/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7fca88787c46fece9edd961ffd41661","title":"uk fracking firm ban on shale gas aurora altcar moss","story":"Aurora Energy drops application to drill at Altcar Moss in LancashireA British fracking company has vowed to challenge the effective ban on shale gas projects after withdrawing its application for two wells in Lancashire.Aurora Energy Resources blamed the government’s “de facto ban on shale gas activity” for its decision to drop an application to frack at Altcar Moss in west Lancashire.The Aberdeen-based gas company has reignited an industry row with the government over its decision late last year to follow the Scottish government’s lead by ending fracking in England.Ian Roche, the managing director of Aurora, said it was “unsurprising” that council officers in Lancashire felt unable to make a decision on the application, which it submitted months before the government imposed a fracking moratorium in November.The government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking in England “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe, after a series of earth tremors in the Lancashire area raised concerns.Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The process often results in seismic activity, but the industry has claimed that the tremors are too weak to pose a threat to public safety.Roche said Aurora plans to “address this issue” with the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.“It is clear from recent comments by the minister of state for energy that the government considers the ‘moratorium’ on hydraulic fracturing to be a de facto ban on shale gas activity in the UK. It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that the council officers have felt unable to determine this application,” Roche said.“It is our view that there is no scientific or public policy justification for the current ‘moratorium’ and Aurora has compiled a body of compelling evidence showing it to be an extreme example of asymmetric regulation, and out of line with the regulation of public amenity impacts across other industries,” he added.The de facto fracking ban was welcomed by green groups last year as a watershed moment for environmental campaigners and local communities which have opposed shale gas fracking in the UK for years.A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/595cc69dcd5ef6769823ca6588df43976cd4d3d0/5_107_3401_2041/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=015a7ff5f71c8fbe701acc1fb98bd81a","title":"nightmare on elm streets john saxon a life in pictures","story":"From teen movies to westerns to horror, the American actor, who has died aged 83, appeared in almost 200 movies during a career that ned seven decades"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b67943895ca6351609e65f225640f027e8c0f6/0_1010_8013_4805/master/8013.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=55b527fec663fff3e0539f4d289d6237","title":"maurizio sarri serie a title juventus win convince scudetto","story":"Winning the scudetto was the minimum requirement but in a difficult season Sarri kept his team on track without excellingJuventus had just won their ninth consecutive Serie A title, but their manager was nowhere to be seen. As the final whistle sounded at the end of a 2-0 win over Sampdoria, Maurizio Sarri headed immediately down into the tunnel, leaving his players to celebrate on the pitch at an empty Allianz Stadium.They would catch up with him soon enough. Wojciech Szczęsny barged in on Sarri’s post-game interview to hand him a lit cigarette, telling him “you earned it”. Back in the changing room, Juan Cuadrado maintained his Scudetto tradition of smothering his boss in shaving foam.Sarri joked that he had fled the pitch in the hope of avoiding this sort of drenching. Perhaps, in truth, he simply had not known what to do with himself. He had just claimed his first Serie A title at the age of 61, becoming the oldest manager ever to win the competition.And yet, here he is. Sarri was in self-effacing mode as he joked with Juventus’s players: “If you’ve won with me, you really must be good.” He allowed himself a little more credit during his TV interviews, as he reminded viewers that this triumph came on the heels of a Europa League win at Chelsea last term.Winning Serie A, it must be acknowledged, is a minimum expectation for Juventus. They have not exactly crossed the finish line in style. They blew a first opportunity to seal the deal when they allowed relegation-threatened Udinese to come from a goal down to beat them on Thursday. Juventus had won only one of their previous four games before that.This was supposed to be the most compelling title race in years, but the coronavirus lockdown threw all the runners off their stride. Lazio, one point behind at the restart, lost five of their first eight games back – an injury-depleted squad collapsing under the demands of an abbreviated schedule. Inter chucked away leads against Bologna, Verona and Sassuolo.Juventus were left to prevail almost by default. Or, at least, that’s how it seemed from the outside. The notion that winning football games is ever easy at the highest level is rarely shared by people who have actually done it.Even on Sunday, a Sampdoria team with no obvious objectives left to fight did an admirable job of holding the champions at arm’s length. Juventus required a wonderfully-worked free-kick to break the deadlock in the sixth minute of first-half injury time, before going on to win 2-0. Miralem Pjanic shaped to shoot but altered his motion at the last moment to square for Cristiano Ronaldo, who drilled home from the edge of the box.It was a goal that offered a glimpse of Sarri’s best work at Juventus. This was Ronaldo’s 31st goal of the Serie A season – matching a club record set by Felice Borel all the way back in 1933-34. It was also a reminder that the manager made his reputation in Italy’s lower leagues, in part, on the back of his repertoire of set pieces.The question of whether this is yet Sarri’s team, rather than simply a talented group of players working from memory, has been a favourite topic for TV analysts and radio phone-in hosts all season. There is no straightforward answer.He has certainly brought the best out of some players. Ronaldo is up 10 on last year’s goal tally, and matched a Serie A record by scoring in 11 consecutive games. Matthijs De Ligt has improved vastly after a torrid start when he was thrust prematurely into the starting line-up following Giorgio Chiellini’s cruciate ligament tear.That statistic hints also at Sarri’s failings. Juventus’s midfield has been a mess, a constantly rotating cast with few stand-out performers. Sarri’s successes at Napoli were built on furiously fast interchanges. Juventus’s ball movement has often been agonisingly slow.The club’s directors ought to share the blame for a transfer policy that has seemed to focus more on opportunities for a bargain than addressing specific needs. Then again, Sarri himself has insisted it is up to a manager to adapt to the players at his disposal, and not the other way around.What matters most, in the end, is not whether this team plays according to some trademark style but whether they play effectively. Sarri has stated more than once that the goal is “vincere e convincere” – to win and convince.On that measure, he still has a way to go. Juventus have thrown away 18 points from winning positions – more than in any other season during this unbroken run of Serie A titles (last term, under Massimiliano Allegri, it was six). The 38 goals they have conceded are the most by an Italian champion since 1960-61. Meanwhile, Atalanta, a club with a fraction of Juventus’s budget, have outscored them by 21 goals.And yet, on the most important measure, Sarri has succeeded – in Serie A, at least. Juventus are a club who continue to live by the mantra of their former president Giampiero Boniperti that “winning is not an important thing, it’s the only thing that counts.”They have been champions of Italy now for 3,005 consecutive days. That achievement speaks first and foremost to structural successes: a thorough modernisation of the club whose first major landmark was the opening of a new stadium in 2011 and which has continued through logo changes and new commercial deals. Enhanced revenue streams have allowed Juventus to invest in their playing squad at a rate that their rivals cannot match.Still, titles are won on the pitch. There were plenty of people willing to bet against Sarri in August, when he was forced to miss the start of the season recovering from pneumonia, and Antonio Conte – the manager who began Juventus’s winning cycle – was launching a fresh revolution at Inter.In this most particular of football seasons all across Europe, Sarri was able to keep his team on track. Missing out on the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa were disappointments, but Juventus are pleased enough with his work for the chief football officer, Fabio Paratici, to confirm that he will be back again next year.With both the Scudetto and his personal future assured, Sarri can turn his attention to preparing for the resumption of the Champions League in August. You will have to excuse him, two decades on from that decision to end his career in banking, if he does not share outsiders’ perceptions of Juventus’s latest triumph as ‘boring’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1acb3590468b9aa9a249aec8910a25af6633c4d6/0_79_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b1f740f4a004d486134c0d68d7a406b","title":"premier league 2019 20 review signings","story":"From scurrying strikers to impulsive wingers, here are our pick of the top flight’s best new arrivals. Also: Players | FlopsGripes | Matches | Pundits | Goals | Managers | Young playersWelcome to the review of the 2019-20 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …Bruno Fernandes has done for Manchester United what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta: he has made them relevant again. His arrival was was the catalyst for a 19-match unbeaten run that suggested they might finally be turning a corner after seven years of post-Ferguson muddling. It’s not just his goals and assists – a record 13 in his first 10 Premier League games – but his personality, infectious standards and irrepressible positivity, which have dragged other players closer to his level. He is proof that playmakers can also be leaders. His belting volley at Brighton, at the end of a blistering counterattack, symbolised United’s improvement either side of lockdown, and he won both player and goal of the month for June. No United signing since Eric Cantona has had such a profound impact. Even his bad games made him look good: when he tired towards the end of the season, United suffered their first blip since he signed. It was confirmation that, after just six months at Old Trafford, he is United’s most important player.Sam Allardyce used to say that he would get a really big coaching job if he was called Sam Allardici. In terms of external respect, Danny Ings has a similar problem. If he was called Ingzaghi, we would marvel at the range of accomplished finishes he has produced this season: 22 in total, just one behind the Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy. Instead there is an unspoken consensus that his form is probably a one-off rather than the age-old tale of a good player going to the next level. That’s also in part because of Ings’ style – he looks like a blue-collar worker, with a relentless, scurrying manner, and it’s notable that his pressing from the front has led to a number of Southampton goals this season. In some ways he is like a swan in reverse, with all that furious paddling on the surface obscuring a tranquil mind. There is a cool precision to his finishing – look at how often he finds the bottom corner – and any striker, British or otherwise, would be proud of this season’s portfolio.Raúl Jiménez might be the best all-round centre-forward in the league – a better link player than Sergio Agüero, a better dribbler than Harry Kane, a more reliable goalscorer than Roberto Firmino. The occasional rabona aside, there is an unobtrusive class to Jiménez’s work, and his double act with Adama Traoré is among the most lethal in the league. He scores all kinds of goals, from the mundane to the spectacular he beats players, holds the ball up and is a good passer. And he’s even rotation-proof: Jiménez has started all bar one of Wolves’ Premier League games. The more you watch him, the more you wonder what the catch is, and why Benfica sold him so cheaply. With each passing game, the suspicion grows that there isn’t one.Rodri is a scholar of the unseen details that determine a football match. At least we think he is we can’t see them. But we know because Pep Guardiola, the world’s leading authority on the work of a deep-lying midfielder, says so. Such players reach their peak at a later age than most, so Rodri’s maturity is a revelation for a 24-year-old. Amid City’s egregious title defence, Rodri has done enough to confirm he is Fernandinho’s long-term successor. He has been the most accurate passer in the entire league this season. His 178 completed passes against West Ham in February set a new Premier League record and highlighted his role as the tiki to everyone else’s taka. Rodri’s defensive role is even more important he reads danger well and, yep, is an excellent judge of a tactical foul. As with all the best deep-lying midfielders, Rodri offers both darkness and light.In the age of Covid-19, Allan Saint-Maximin puts a new twist on an old maxim: he is worth the Sky, BT Sport and Amazon subscriptions alone. Newcastle have not been the easiest team to watch in recent years but Saint-Maximin, an outrageous bargain at £20m, has changed all that. He’s not so much a street footballer as a playground dribbler, who receives the ball and decides it’s time to take on the world, just for the hell of it. His speed, trickery, ceaseless imagination and confidence make him a nightmare to play against, not least because a defender has no idea what is going to happen next. Nor does he. Saint-Maximin’s dribbling style is similar to that of Ronaldinho, who almost convulsed with excitement at what he was going to do next. On his good days – and there have been plenty of those, especially since lockdown – Saint-Maximin can be devastating. He picked up a hat-trick of assists when Newcastle thumped Bournemouth 4-1 at the start of July. On others, his decision-making can be woefully awry. But that’s all part of the fun.NB: Danny Ings and Raúl Jiménez joined their clubs on loan in 2018 before making permanent moves last summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d68d5f13c768feb728eed7975da3209122d65d5b/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec5869c64f46215b9e50f9ec9e119a2f","title":"premier league 2019 20 review young players","story":"This year’s suggestions are made up of players who were aged 21 and younger at the start of the seasonWelcome to the review of the 2019-20 Premier League season. We have nominated some contenders for this category but this is just to get the discussion going: offer your suggestions below the line …This is only the third time the  has had this category in its end-of-season awards, and Alexander-Arnold has been in all of them. Given that he doesn’t turn 22 until October, there’s still time for one more. It has been another season of wild achievement for the right-back, one of only three qualifying players to appear in every Premier League game (the others being West Ham’s Declan Rice, who hasn’t missed a single minute but who like his team has not always reached his full potential, and the excellent Burnley winger Dwight McNeil). For the second year in a row Alexander-Arnold hit double-figures in top-flight assists – only Kevin De Bruyne registered more – but he has improved his goal output he scored with a lovely low shot in the Boxing Day thrashing of Leicester, probably his and his team’s finest display of the campaign. Jürgen Klopp says he is “one of the most relentless professionals I’ve met when it comes to focusing on getting better each and every day”. Cafu thinks “he will be regarded as one of the best players in the world”. He is still only 21.Most clubs are constantly searching for first-team-ready young talent, but Norwich seem particularly good at it. Perhaps, in fact, a little too good. The three defenders with the most appearances for the club this season are Aarons, a 20-year-old right-back, Jamal Lewis, a 22-year-old left-back, and Ben Godfrey, a centre-back born 10 days before Lewis in January 1998. All three qualify for this list, along with the midfielder Todd Cantwell, 22, while their key creative force, Emiliano Buendía, is only 23. But there is a value to experience, and starting a first Premier League season with a back four largely populated by players 21 and under with no top-flight experience is not the best way to secure a second Premier League season. They have duly conceded more goals than any other team. Inidually, however, they remain excellent prospects, with Aarons perhaps the pick. Since making his league debut in the East Anglian derby against Ipswich in September 2018 he has started all but two league games and never been substituted, a remarkable record for one so young.Last season Greenwood made three league appearances and played three minutes in the Champions League this season he has crept slowly into the team – he didn’t start a league game until December – but it ends with him in Manchester United’s starting XI and looking ready to stay there, having developed the endearing habit of lashing balls into nets with either foot. He is clearly a fine instinctive finisher, is a faster sprinter even than Marcus Rashford, and has a knack for taking shots early that befuddles goalkeepers. “He’s developed fantastically this season,” says Ole Gunnar Solskjær. “The sky’s the limit.” One of three players at Manchester United who might easily have made the list, alongside Marcus Rashford and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.In contrast to others on this list, Foden doesn’t really have the stats to back up his inclusion. For every game he has started he has spent one and a half on the bench before the new year he spent more than 23 minutes on the pitch only once. But when he has played he has looked extremely classy. He is comfortable on either foot, has got more and more game time as the season has progressed, and has had Pep Guardiola gushing ever more effusively about his potential. “I’ve seen many players in my life – I have trained incredible, incredible players,” says the Spaniard, “and Phil will be one of them.”It feels like a long time since England had so many young players bursting impressively into top-flight teams. Every side playing in Europe next season has at least one key player who is English and was 21 or younger when the campaign started (Leicester’s Harvey Barnes is the only one not to have got a mention elsewhere), and Chelsea have a handful (as well as the American Christian Pulisic, whose post-lockdown form has been sensational, and several impressive cameos from the 19-year-old Scot Billy Gilmour). Mount in particular has been exceptional. He has been involved in every league game but one – as well as every England match – this season, and brings dynamism and constant effort to midfield as well as attacking threat.Goalkeepers often catch the eye in struggling teams, but Ramsdale has played with consistency and maturity in his debut top-flight season despite the chaos sometimes taking place in front of him. He was particularly outstanding in the 2-0 defeat to Southampton, including a fine penalty save in which he refused to be taken in by Danny Ings’ mid-run dummy, and did not deserve the dejection with which he slumped to the turf on the final whistle. Six Premier League teams this season have first-choice goalkeepers aged 33 or above, and it takes a brave manager to put promise over experience in this of all positions. Not a lot has worked out for Eddie Howe this season, but for this at least, he deserves credit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11714745475f107e308d31073fb8cb11e6000501/85_0_1692_1015/master/1692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c70dafe6670104683e975e583968a350","title":"xbox series x games technology matt booty microsoft","story":"The head of Xbox Studios says the machine removes the need to think about technical constraints – and discusses controversial Halo: Infinite and Fable demosThe era of video game design being defined by technology is over, according to Microsoft. Two hours after the Xbox showcase event livestreamed on 23 July, I’m speaking to the company’s head of studios, Matt Booty, via video call. The showcase revealed 22 games exclusively developed for Xbox consoles, nine coming from first-party teams – a clear response to Sony’s live event in June, which concentrated on exclusive PlayStation 5 titles. But there was no mention of hardware during the one-hour stream, and now Booty is keen to make that point that projects developed for Xbox Series X, due this Christmas, will not be as delineated or constrained by hardware specifications as they have been in the past.“We’re at a point where the technology is out of the way,” he says. “In previous generations, the hardware and its limitations would leave a pretty clear fingerprint on a game. I remember the first early games that used sprite scaling and then suddenly every game had all these objects flying around the screen. You’d build a game around technical advances like that. But now we’re at the point with the tech where we can just let the stories and the characters that the teams have in mind reach the screen.”During its livestreamed event, Halo: Infinite led the Xbox showcase with footage of the game’s campaign mode it was followed by the latest title in the Forza Motorsport series, and a longer look at Everwild, the eco adventure in development at veteran West Midlands studio, Rare.A highlight, however, was the final reveal of the event: a return of the acclaimed role-playing series, Fable, originally developed at Lionhead, a studio controversially closed by Microsoft in 2016. As long rumoured, the new title will be developed by Leamington-based Playground Games, which until now has been responsible solely for the driving series, Forza Horizon.According to Booty, it was the studio’s experience with large open-world environments that singled it out for the project. “I just look at what Playground has done with the Horizon series – that attention to detail, the ability to represent these naturalistic landscapes. They also have a real passion for the IP and a unique point of view on what’s core to Fable. Everything I’ve seen as the game progresses tells me this is going to be a very high-quality release.”Rumours surfaced at the weekend that the new title will be a massively multiplayer online game rather than a true narrative sequel to Fable 3. Those rumours have since been refuted by other news sources. While not directly addressing the speculation, Booty claimed the new title will respect the legacy of the series, as well as bringing in the studio’s own ideas.“With any kind of franchise like that, where you’ve had existing versions, there’s always that balance between what you’re going to bring forward, what still stands up, and what you want to add that’s new,” he says. “It’s like the challenge of making a new Star Wars movie – there’s stuff that everyone wants you to bring along, but then you’ve got a responsibility to that, to new places and I trust Playground has a good vision for that.”Elsewhere, the demo footage of Halo: Infinite, which is taking a more open-world approach than previous titles, also drew mixed reactions from fans. Twitter debates raged for hours after the presentation, with some feeling the art direction made the visuals look flat, while others felt the gameplay looked dated compared with contemporary shooters.However, Booty says that developer 343 Industries has been closely guided by the Halo community during the game’s creation. “343 works with dedicated insider groups that are always giving them feedback,” he says. “They’re as plugged in as any team could be to feedback from core fans, from the esports community, and from people who have seen what they’ve done with the Halo: Master Chief collection. Games of the genre have evolved and moved forward. The art of game design is figuring out what feedback you’re going to incorporate, where to strike a balance, and I think they’re well plugged into a big community to do that.”Booty also claims that the Xbox Series X era will make it easier for gamers to dip in and out of games and therefore experiment with a wider selection of experiences. Through its Game Pass Ultimate subscription service – and the new console’s quick resume feature, which lets owners open and switch between multiple titles without losing their progress – players can take a similar approach to games as they do to browsing television platforms.“Digital delivery and Game Pass have created a much more ready audience for games,” he says. “And, through 5G, delivery is another thing we hope just gets out of the way. That’s one of the beauties of online services like Netflix – you can browse so readily, it’s instant. If you don’t like one thing, you can move on to the next without much penalty. I think we’re inching up on that with games. The ability to try something you might not have the motivation to purchase almost becomes friction-free and that makes connects between creators and this broad audience we’re building.”But it is Booty’s views on the capabilities of the Xbox Series X, and how they will allow developers to focus on game design rather than technical challenges, that will be most keenly analysed when the machine arrives later this year. The argument is not that there are no technical constraints any more, but that the machine is so powerful, the emphasis will be on possibilities dictated by design rather than limitations dictated by specifications.“If you look at movies, we’ve become almost numb to how amazing the special effects are,” he says. “You watch actors being portrayed as 20 years younger, you see these amazing worlds, and you just take it for granted – and that’s about getting the technology out of the way.“I think we’re inching up on that in games, where the tech to create is just there and hopefully players are being drawn more into the story and the world and less thinking, ‘Oh wow, the load time on this game is really short.’ I mean, it’s great to have short load times, but I hope that’s not what players will pay attention to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fc8b228c237ba8c4b63633bb913ef2ef07186ad/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6f942645021bbb19dd2c7f7d9bf44f28","title":"rick stein oh god ive had a lot of therapy","story":"The chef talks about his restaurant business and laying off staff during the lockdown, his two marriages and how his father’s bipolar disorder affected his childhoodIn March, Rick Stein travelled to Australia to check up on the two restaurants he has there. He intended to stay for a couple of weeks, but he is still there, sitting in front of his computer screen. It is first thing in the morning for me, but it is the evening for Stein, and he is planning to go to the pub. He was hoping to make it back to the UK early next month, but his flight was cancelled. So, from his house in Sydney, he is watching as the pandemic wreaks havoc across the UK’s restaurants, including his own.It must be stressful, I say. Stein smiles and rubs his hand over his head. “It can be a bit frustrating because I don’t get told everything that’s happening back at base,” he says. “I have to keep jumping up and down, saying: ‘Hey, I’m still here!’” He laughs a lot, and I can’t tell if this is just his affable style, familiar from his TV cookery programmes, or a nervous defence mechanism.With his first wife, Jill, Stein opened the Seafood Restaurant in Padstow, a small fishing port in North Cornwall. This was in 1975, so he has been through recessions and a financial crisis before. How does this compare? “Much worse,” he says with a grim smile. “In 2008, we had to cut back and lay off staff, but nothing like this. We didn’t have to close any restaurants we didn’t have as many restaurants then, of course. But this has been …” He trails off. “If we hadn’t done what we’ve done, we would have gone to the wall, no question about it. Unfortunately, a lot of restaurants will.”Stein decided not to reopen two of his six British restaurants when they were allowed to start trading again at the beginning of July. That was, he says, “very unpleasant. It’s been really tricky explaining to the staff that it has to go” – and their jobs with it. He hopes that the chef Michael Caines, who bought Stein’s restaurant in Porthleven in west Cornwall earlier this month, will keep on the staff. Meanwhile, Stein had to present “quite a complicated case” to the bank to get a loan to carry the business over for the other four restaurants (there is also a cafe, two fish and chip shops, a pub, a cookery school and holiday cottages, mostly based in Cornwall). “We still don’t know whether we’ll make it or not because, cash-wise, the worst time for us will be next January and February,” he says. “Thank goodness the government has seen fit to let us open for the two busiest months in the summer.”At the end of March, the company was criticised for reportedly telling staff they would not be paid until the government’s job retention scheme kicked in, which would have left them without salaries for more than a month. The company’s managing director, Ian Fitzgerald, later clarified that its 600-plus furloughed staff would be paid, but it was a question of timing – to honour the payroll on time could have meant running out of cash and, he said: “The company may have to close permanently.” He has now said in a statement to the : “We paid for all hours worked up until the enforced closure. The government furlough scheme then applied and was paid on the same day we received the grants.” In April, staff received their pay in two instalments.Stein admits it has “been tricky. I think when you’re in a situation like that, you can’t turn around and blame yourself for being too mean or something. It’s just either you do that or you go out of business.”Stein is 73, though he seems strangely ageless and has no intention of retiring. “It’s a bloody nightmare being 73 really because I don’t feel any older than I was 40 years ago.” Perhaps, he concedes, he feels “a bit creaky”. He is an accidental restaurateur. Originally, he had planned to run a nightclub. He opened a club in Padstow, before losing his licence once it became known as a trouble spot, and reopened it as the restaurant it now is.It has been a choppy ride, however. Stein became one of the original celebrity chefs, making his first TV series in the mid-90s. When, in 2002, he left Jill for his second wife, Sarah, an Australian publicist 20 years his junior, after a five-year affair, there was much public interest. Then, as the Stein empire grew, so did rumours, fuelled by tabloid interviews with angry local people, about a bitterness between the locals and the interloper. But the suggestions that he moved in and took over, or that he did not buy the fish for his restaurants locally proved to be incorrect, and Stein himself is no outsider in the area. He has been in Cornwall for nearly 50 years, and spent childhood summers there. His connection to the area goes back even further, to his grandparents who bought a house there just after the first world war.In Stein’s 2013 memoir, he wrote vividly about growing up on a farm in the Cotswolds, and his exposure to food. His dad, the managing director of a distilling company, liked to point out, at Sunday lunch, that everything from the meat to the vegetables had come from their land. “If you are used to eating well as a child, you will end up probably being quite serious about what you eat as an adult, so I feel very blessed with that.”The flipside to Stein’s otherwise idyllic and privileged childhood was his father’s bipolar disorder. In his book, he writes that his mother protected him and his four siblings from the worst of his father’s depressive periods, but he also wrote that his father was “someone I was scared of”. When Stein was 17, his father killed himself. He spent the next few years travelling and grafting his way around Australia and America – working on ships and railroads and in an abbatoir. He was trying to be a “manly Ernest Hemingway character”, he writes, when really he was “on the run from the memory of my father” and his death. Back in the UK, despite his two Es at A-level, with the help of a private tutor, he wangled a place as a mature student at Oxford to read English.He has said before that his father’s death made him more driven. “I think so,” he says now. “I’ve definitely got a sense of not being very good at stuff. It’s sort of absurd because, you know, I’ve done really quite well for myself, but I still really doubt myself. It’s just the way I am.” Has he had therapy? “Oh God, yeah, a lot of therapy. I understand it now. It’s fine, I understand it.” His wife comes into the room to remind him that they need to go and he tells her he’ll be a minute, then returns to the thought. “But it’s silly. It’s difficult to tell, isn’t it, whether you are naturally a person that likes hard work and does things, or whether you feel you’ve got to prove something?”Asked for his biggest achievement, he takes a long pause. “I think the restaurants really.” It seems impressive, I say, that the business managed to survive the Steins’ orce and that Jill is still very much part of it. “I think it was just too good a business to … People feel very strongly about restaurants if they’re involved in them. It tends to take over your life for good and bad.” Was it difficult to keep everyone together, including Jill? “It’s not always been great, I have to say.” He smiles, but is clearly not prepared to go into it further (I’m also aware of someone, his wife I think, wandering around in the background).There is also a hint that, horrible though this time is, Stein seems to thrive on the challenge. You don’t, after all, go into the restaurant business for an easy life, and you don’t try to push fish and seafood in a country that is traditionally suspicious of anything that doesn’t come in batter or breadcrumbs. “I ring up Ian and a few of the other managers and there is this sense that we’re going through something together,” he says. “There’s a tremendous feeling of bonding with people. That’s what’s good about the industry anyway, because it is tough at times, you do tend to rely on each other.” He says he knows “it must be very depressing” for his employees who will lose their jobs, but says that, among his staff: “It’s a real sense of us all working together to keep the business running. It’s better to fight and all go down together sort of thing.” And he has been pleased at the way his three sons, who are all involved in the business in some way, have “sort of taken over. It’s made them a lot more responsible. That’s made me very proud of them.”But no-shows aside – and he is quick to say he understands if people suddenly feel uneasy about going to a restaurant – the experience of reopening has been good, he says. “People want to go out and eat, there’s no question about that. It’s not something that’s just going to go because of Covid. It’s heartening the way people have come back to restaurants.”Stein has coped with the stress of the pandemic by swimming every day. During Sydney’s lockdown, he did a lot of gardening and DIY, and read. Like many people, he learned to make sourdough bread. He kept in touch with his UK empire every day and although he has a business partner in Australia who oversees the running of his restaurants there, he says: “There’s plenty going on. And I’m doing some TV as well.” The cooking-and-travel shows will be put on hold once he is back in the UK (he splits his time between here and Australia) and he is going to do a programme about Cornwall. “I doubt there will be a lot of travel for the next six months. But that’s great, I’m quite missing Cornwall.”Can his Cornish businesses survive with all the changes that have to be made, including fewer tables? “I don’t know,” he admits. “I think at the moment we’re doing quite well. It’s just a question of whether we can take enough to compensate for the months we were shut, and what happens in October and November.”He will fight on, in his own hardworking and slightly diffident way, in a business in which he has spent nearly half a century. He is, he says, “very optimistic about the future. I think human beings thrive on communication, and pubs and restaurants are a great way of communicating, a great way of enjoying each other.” Restaurants are still, he says, “really important”.

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4. Encourage parents and pupils to use school devices which are already locked down, and loan them out if necessary.5. Think of tech as an enhancement to safeguarding, rather than a barrier to it.Interested in finding out more about safeguarding pupils online?

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster. Zendesk’s CRM software for support, sales and customer engagement is quick to implement and easily scales to meet the changing needs of your business.

It has a gorgeous, bright and colourful, 90Hz AMOLED screen that is 6.44in on the diagonal with FHD+ resolution, which is only 0.11in smaller than the 8. The screen is flat, rather than curved at the sides, and a dual-selfie camera peers through the screen, taking up a fair chunk of real estate in the top left corner.The rest of the phone is fairly standard for a high-end device in 2020. Metal sides, glass front and back, with a vertical camera lump to one side. It is extremely attractive in a light blue colour but also comes in a metallic-like grey. The curved glass back is fairly grippy, which makes the Nord feel great in the hand and easy to hold and use without a case, although a high-quality clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) case is included in the box.There is a USB-C port in the bottom but no headphones socket – which is more common in smartphones priced under £400 than at the top end of the market. It’s not obvious from the outside that the Nord is not a £600+ smartphone.The Nord has one of Qualcomm’s latest 5G-capable mid-range processors, the Snapdragon 765G, rather than the top-end Snapdragon 865. It comes with either 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, depending on the model. It is worth noting that the storage is the older, slower UFS 2.1 standard, not the faster, newer UFS 3.0 standard that has been used in top-end smartphones since last year.Performance all round was very good indeed. During day-to-day usage, launching apps, switching between them, browsing in Chrome, email in Gmail, trying to avoid the dross of social media and hurriedly setting teams against tight deadlines for the final weeks of the Fantasy Premier League, I could not tell the difference between the Nord and the stellar OnePlus 8 Pro. That, in itself, is an achievement and has as much to do with well-optimised software as the processor.You could notice a performance difference in graphically demanding games, while trying to manage a giant spreadsheet in Google Sheets or while rapidly scrolling through very media-heavy sites but some top-end phones from rivals also struggle a little with some of those activities compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro.Battery life is also good and lasts about 32 hours, from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two, which is more than enough to make it through the toughest of days and a night out. That matches the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro’s 32-hour batteries and beats Apple’s iPhone SE by five hours and Google’s Pixel 3a by eight hours.That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the screen set to 90Hz and on for more than five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, browsing and using apps, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos.Note that it was impossible to test the effects of 5G on battery life because I do not receive 5G at my home, to which I am restricted because of the Covid-19 situation in the UK. Also, pending a software update, the phone is limited to 4G only when two sims are used at the same time.The Nord ships with the same OxygenOS 10.5 based on Android 10 as the 8 and 8 Pro.Google’s Discover feed features on the home screen, alongside nice touches such as full theme support and choices for animations such as that around the fingerprint scanner. The ability to choose which icons show in the status bar is particularly useful, given the large space taken up by the dual-selfie camera in screen. OxygenOS does have a dark mode but it cannot be toggled on and off quickly, as with most smartphones.OxygenOS has developed into the best version of Android you can get on a phone, balancing features, aesthetics and speed like no other, even without a top-of-the-line processor. OxygenOS’s one long-term downside, which is common to all OnePlus phones and has been a problem for several years, is that it aggressively shuts down apps in the background more than most other manufacturers, which prolongs battery life but also delays notifications and can break functionality for some apps. I noticed delays to security camera alerts, new message notifications and fantasy football events, among others.OnePlus only offers software support for three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bimonthly schedule. Apple offers five for its iPhones, including the £400 iPhone SE, so there’s still work to be done for OnePlus.The OnePlus Nord has a quad-camera system on the back, including the same 48-megapixel main camera as the OnePlus 8, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, a 2-megapixel macro camera and a depth-sensor.The main 48MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default (a 48MP mode is available) and captures some really great-looking images, with good contrast and colour in bright light and reasonable images in middling to poor light. Low-light performance is average but is helped by the dedicated Nightscape mode. What was pretty good in a phone costing £599 with the OnePlus 8 is very good indeed at the £379 asking price of the Nord.There’s no optical zoom, relying entirely on digital zoom from the main camera, which is fine at 2x but not much good beyond that. The 8MP ultra-wide camera is fairly average compared with top-end rivals, with a noticeable softening of detail around the sides, but can produce good-looking wide-angle images in bright light if you do not zoom in on them too much. The 2MP macro camera is total rubbish for close-up shots I got far better results with just the main camera and zooming in a little bit.Video is pretty good, too, particularly at this price point, with up to 4K at 30 frames per second available. The dual-selfie camera on the front has one main 32MP camera and one 8MP ultra-wide, both are fixed-focus. Together they produce pretty good images, with a good amount of detail, but even in good light they can be a little grainy in areas around the eyes on closer inspection. It is nice to have the ability to take a wider angle to fit more people in.The OnePlus Nord is a very good phone full stop – and an absolute bargain at only £379.It looks the part. The screen is great. The rear main camera is great and the battery life is very good. It is just as fast, smooth and refined in day-to-day usage as OnePlus’s smartphones costing twice as much and it supports 5G, whenever that arrives in your neighbourhood. Other than from reading the spec sheet and seeing the inclusion of a mid-range processor, it’s really not obvious where any corners have been cut.The Nord has stiff competition from Apple’s 4G-only £419 iPhone SE but otherwise blows the competition out of the water. In fact, I really can’t see why you would pay an extra £220 for the OnePlus 8 but that’s a problem for OnePlus not the consumer.Overall, the OnePlus Nord is one hell of a lot of phone for £379 and will take some beating.Pros: great 90Hz AMOLED screen, great performance, solid battery life, fast charging, great software, looks stunning in blue, good main camera, top-notch build, dual-sim, 5G, superfast in-screen fingerprint scanner.Cons: no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, no water-resistance rating, 5G disabled when using two sims, only three years of software updates, OxygenOS can break third-party app notifications.

Ten metres ahead of us, a red deer had materialised from the piney depths of the forest. It had early-season antlers – a pair of bony stumps the size of garden hand-forks – and a glossy, chestnut coat. Eyes fixed, it trotted across the cycle path and disappeared again into the trees. “That was like … an animation!” spluttered Bethan. Then her attention turned to her older brother, pedalling ahead of us in the middle distance, and an even more exciting thought occurred: “And Joe missed it!”The three of us – respectively aged 8, 11 and lost count – had come to the New Forest on a two-night hostelling trip. Among other things, it was a chance to get away and enjoy another part of the country. But hold on. A hostelling trip in summer 2020? Well, technically, yes. YHA England \u0026amp Wales eased back into business earlier this month, reopening 30 of its 153 hostels on 17 July. A further 63 are now available for exclusive hire. The 30 properties taking inidual bookings were selected chiefly for their outdoor space and their self-contained accommodation options. YHA New Forest, tucked away down a long, unsealed lane in the dappled belly of the national park, fits that bill.The hostel itself is a large white mansion, refurbed in 2017, and set in shaggy gardens. On our visit, four of its en suite guest rooms had been opened. That was on the inside. But we were staying outside, in the grounds, where three camping pods and two caravan-like “land pods” (all sleeping four) provide budget-friendly glamping. The pods were in place before the pandemic, but being at least five metres apart and each with its own outdoor table, they could have been created in response to social distancing.Our base (child’s verdict: “the cosiest den ever”) was one of the pine-clad camping pods, with two single beds and a double. All other guests at the hostel were also in family groups, which turned the place into a kind of rambling, all-ages holiday camp. The evenings rang to the fluting notes of treetop blackbirds, the automated whirr of hand-sanitiser dispensers and the merry bedlam of kids playing hide-and-seek too loudly. Parents exhaled audibly. I can’t speak for other, busier parts of the New Forest, but here in the woods it felt like a release.The YHA marks its 90th anniversary this year. Back in 1930, it was created as a social enterprise “to help all… to a greater knowledge, use and love of the countryside, particularly by providing hostels or other simple accommodation for them on their travels”. That ethos still holds true, although today’s hostels would be largely unrecognisable to pre-war hikers. Curfews and chores are long gone. These days they have bars, private rooms and bike-repair stations alongside the traditional dorms and drying rooms.Well. Maybe not these days. On our visit, the self-catering kitchens and the lounge were off limits. Reception was done one family at a time, showers were bookable in time-slots and breakfast came in the form of pre-ordered baps. We got pizzas delivered for dinner. It would take a crystal ball to judge how and when things might change – all open hostels are working to a system that suits their particular set up – although staff were doing their damnedest to juggle the current arrangements smoothly. “We’ve only been open two days,” said Steph, the perma-smiling manager. “It feels like weeks already!”What the YHA has always excelled at, of course, is locations. Find a ravishing outdoor spot in England or Wales and the charity’s green-triangle logo is likely to be nearby. It has 19 hostels in the Lakes alone. This New Forest setting is a fine one, too. Minutes after arrival, the kids were roaming the surroundings, biking down a dusty track (“it’s got jumps!”) and gingerly summiting a huge fallen beech tree. We spent the next day on a 12-mile bike ride that looped through the forest, wending slowly from the hostel out to Bolderwood Arboretum, mainly on car-free trails. It was a joy: a packed-lunch voyage through an uncrowded world of ferns, oaks and breeze-tossed butterflies. After dropping the bikes back at the hostel we made a 10-minute walk for ice-creams into the village of Burley, where nonchalant ponies were blocking the traffic.I’ve stayed in enough YHA hostels to know what was missing from the normal experience – that muddy-boot murmur of camaraderie, chatting and swapping stories over dinner – but those elements will return in time. For now, it was a thrill to be somewhere where we could breathe deep, lay on the grass and watch the stars appear, and where, in the green heart of the woods, we could cross paths with a deer, and marvel at its innocence.

In the era of Black Lives Matter, what do these battles reveal about the American South’s Confederate flag?John Schneider, AKA Bo Duke from the TV show The Dukes of Hazzard, recently asked his fans a question via YouTube: “Was The Dukes of Hazzard a racially charged show? Was the intention of the paint scheme on the General Lee a white supremacist statement in any way? And if you think it was, I wanna know.”For the uninitiated, the General Lee was the Duke brothers’ 1969 Dodge Charger, which outperformed the cop cars of rural Georgia week after week from 1979 to 1985. Bo and Luke’s car was named after a Confederate civil war hero its horn played the opening bars of Dixie and, as for its paint scheme, it sported a giant Confederate flag on its roof. It was basically the South on wheels.We all know why Schneider felt the need to ask, 35 years after the show ended. In response to the police killing of George Floyd and the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests, Confederate monuments and symbols are being removed and reassessed, not least the flag. In June, Nascar banned Confederate flags from its race meetings and Mississippi became the final US state to remove the Confederate battle emblem from its state flag. And earlier this month, the US Defense Department banned the Confederate flag and “other isive symbols” from all military bases. Culture is also undergoing a reappraisal: Amazon’s streaming service is considering removing The Dukes of Hazzard from its catalogue.And it’s not over yet. Dispute rages over what the Confederate flag really signifies. With his limitless desire to open another front in the culture wars, President Trump recently asserted it represents “freedom of speech”, and criticised Nascar. Spike Lee, on the other hand, said the flag made him feel “the same way my Jewish brothers and sisters feel about the swastika”. Having once stood for one, unambiguous thing – the Confederate army during the American civil war – the flag has now accumulated a multitude of meanings, many far removed from the original Confederate cause. Popular culture has been central to that process.The responses to Schneider’s question were an overwhelming “No”, even from commenters claiming to be black and Latino fans. On the face of it, The Dukes of Hazzard was simple, good-natured fun. It barely ever broached matters of race, slavery or the civil war, although the erasure of non-white characters from the landscape made that easier. Sure, their car had a Confederate flag, but the Dukes were just “good ol’ boys, never meanin’ no harm”, as the theme tune had it.The Confederate flag as we know it – 13 white stars on a blue cross with a red background – was designed in 1861 by William Porcher Miles, an avowed pro-slavery secessionist politician. After the civil war, it became the prevailing way to represent the Confederacy, initially in the context of military history and memorials. It began to seep into popular culture in the 1940s, says John Coski, historian at the American Civil War Museum and author of The Confederate Battle Flag. It was adopted by southern fraternities and soldiers from the south used it during the second world war. It entered postwar politics via the pro-segregation Dixiecrats. In the early 1950s, the US developed a “flag fad” and suddenly it was everywhere: on T-shirts, licence plates and mugs. “It became an icon for an attitude,” says Coski.And that attitude was “rebel”. But, rather than military and political rebellion against the north in defence of a racist ideology, the flag came to represent more nebulous forms of rebellion. Lynyrd Skynyrd’s 1974 pro-southern anthem Sweet Home Alabama famously featured the flag on its cover, and the band used it liberally in their graphics, merch and stage act, as did such other southern rock acts as Tom Petty and the Allman Brothers Band. Petty would unfurl the flag on stage during the song Rebels, whose chorus begins: “I was born a rebel down in Dixie.” They all later renounced its use, though not Johnny Cash, who sang in front of it on The Muppet Show in 1980.On screen, the flag came to represent another form of rebellion, that of the outlaw. It had often figured in movies in a historical context, as in Gone With the Wind, but a new trail was blazed by car-chase caper Smokey and the Bandit, the US’s highest-grossing movie of 1977 after Star Wars. It features many elements The Dukes of Hazzard would later adapt: a charming southern maverick (Burt Reynolds) evading inept cops in a fast car, with a Confederate flag on its licence plate.In both cases, the flag is associated with mild rebellion against the local law, more on the level of moonshine-running, in a virtually post-racial south. Consciously or not, pop culture was now in step with the “lost cause” narrative, which had striven to dissociate the Confederacy from slavery and racism, aligning it instead with nobility and heroism.The reality was quite different. For one thing, General Lee wasn’t some good soldier who happened to be on the losing side. “When Robert E Lee’s army marched into Pennsylvania in the summer of 1863,” says historian Kevin Levin, “it was with the intent of kidnapping upwards of 200 free blacks. That army was carrying the Confederate battle flag. That army was a slave-catching army. It was functioning as the military arm of a government that had one purpose: to protect the institution of slavery.”To African Americans especially, the Confederate flag represents a darker form of rebellion, one that targets their civil rights. The flag was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s and was frequently brandished by counter-protesters at civil rights marches. Even in 1982, when The Dukes of Hazzard was at its peak, John Hawkins, the first black cheerleader at the University of Mississippi, ignited a controversy by refusing to bear the flag at college football games, where it was a ubiquitous fixture. His fraternity was picketed by over 1,000 white students waving Confederate flags. The local Ku Klux Klan held a protest.“What is the idea that this symbol is intended to convey?” says Kyle Bowser, consultant to the Hollywood bureau of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). “The common denominators seem to be elements that are malicious, unproductive and certainly injurious to certain members of our society.” In 2000, the NAACP and other groups began an economic boycott of South Carolina over its refusal to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol, where it had flown since 1962.Ironically, around the same time, the flag began to be appropriated by black musicians, who sought to redefine its meaning. Such rappers as Outkast’s André 3000, Lil Jon and Ludacris all wore the symbol. Ludacris caused a stir at the 2005 Vibe awards by performing draped head to toe in a Confederate flag outfit. After the show, he said: “This flag represents the oppression that we as African Americans have endured for years. This is a symbol of segregation and racism. At the end of the performance, I removed and stomped on the flag to reveal my version of the flag – a flag comprised of black, red and green. Those are the colours of Africa.”In a less thought-out way, in 2013 Kanye West wore a jacket emblazoned with the flag and incorporated it into merchandise for his Yeezus tour. “I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag,” he said. “Now what you gonna do?”All these attempts to untether the flag from its original associations were largely undone in 2015, when a mass shooting in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, left nine African Americans dead. The 21-year-old shooter, Dylann Roof, was avowedly motivated by white supremacist beliefs, and his website featured images of himself waving the Confederate flag. Within weeks, major retailers – including Wal-Mart, Amazon, Sears and eBay – pledged to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise. The manufacture of toy replicas of the General Lee also ceased. And, in a victory for the NAACP, the flag was removed from the South Carolina state capitol. Mississippi was the last hold-out.To its defenders, as the bumper sticker puts it, the flag represents “heritage not hate”. The NAACP’s Kyle Bowser responds: “I would press those who feel that connection to clearly articulate that heritage. Is it the food they ate? Is it a style of dress or art? I don’t see what the connective tissue is between states that hoisted the Confederate flag, other than their commitment to the exploitation of black people.”John Coski points out that the people who were most opposed to the proliferation of the Confederate flag into the wider culture were Confederate groups themselves. The United Daughters of the Confederacy were responsible for airbrushing Confederate history and erecting monuments to the civil war in the 20th century. In the 1940s and 50s, they campaigned to pass laws restricting the use of the flag solely to historical and commemorative purposes.“Why make a point of trying to keep it out there,” says Coski, “where everyone has a right to interpret it however they wish? Isn’t it in your interest to limit it to museums, where it has an unambiguous historical context, or to cemeteries where it has an unambiguous memorial context?”Should we also put The Dukes of Hazzard in a museum? Should we remove it from our screens, like Disney did with Song of the South (having accepted that the film’s cheery nostalgia for slavery and plantation life was grossly offensive) or provide historical context, as HBO Max recently did with Gone With the Wind? These are tricky questions. But, while the “culture war” grinds on, no creator of film, television, music or art is likely to use the Confederate flag unthinkingly ever again – and most will choose not to use it at all.As with the Confederacy itself, the fight to retain the flag in US public life is facing defeat. The only thing it now seems to symbolise is America’s inability to heal its isions and reconcile with its past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7797ba4ab4ce5e8d625333b291531ecfff5c86a6/200_276_3982_2390/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a32a02bea709b5641d8b81b9c116db8","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

The AI model was developed to recognise iniduals simply from a photograph of their backs while they were busy nest-building.Together with researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour, in Germany, Ferreira then demonstrated that the technology can be applied to two of the most commonly-studied species in Europe: wild great tits and captive zebra finches.For AI models to accurately identify iniduals they must be trained with thousands of labelled images. This is easy for companies such as Facebook with access to millions of pictures of people voluntarily tagged by users, but acquiring labelled photographs of birds or animals is more difficult.The researchers, also from institutes in Portugal and South Africa, overcame this challenge by building feeders with camera traps and sensors. Most birds in the study populations already carried a tag similar to microchips which are implanted in cats and dogs. Antennae on the bird feeders read the identity of the bird from these tags and triggered the cameras.While some larger inidual animals can be recognised by the human eye because of distinctive patterns – a leopard’s spots, or a pine marten’s chest markings, for example – AI models have previously been used to identify inidual primates, pigs and elephants. But the potential of the models had not been explored in smaller creatures outside the laboratory, such as birds.According to Ferreira, the lead author of the study, the use of cameras and AI computer models could save on expensive fieldwork, spare animals from procedures such as catching and marking them, and enable much longer-term studies.“It is not very expensive to put a remote camera on a study population for eight years but for somebody to stay there and do the fieldwork for that long is not always possible,” he said. “It removes the need for the human to be a data collector so researchers can spend more time thinking about the questions instead of collecting the data.”The AI model is currently only able to re-identify iniduals it has been shown before. But the researchers are now trying to build more powerful AI models that can identify larger study groups of birds, and distinguish iniduals even if they have never seen them before. This would enable new iniduals without tags to be recorded by the cameras and recognised by the computers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcbfadd1def6f53764253675622d13f2cdc6b5e9/0_390_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e5d8d8e1512c7e518f2aa56d257e9f88","title":"coronavirus alabama covid 19 baptist church revival","story":"More than 40 people were infected with the coronavirus after attending a multi-day revival event at a north Alabama Baptist church, according to the congregation’s pastor.“The whole church has got it, just about,” Pastor Daryl Ross of Warrior Creek Missionary Baptist church in Marshall county told AI.The pastor said churchgoers, including himself, tested positive after a series of religious services featuring a guest pastor over several days last week.Ross said the services were shut down by Friday after one of the members who attended tested positive for the virus.

Marmot says drivers were at risk because of their job and also their underlying health as many had high blood pressure. They were more likely to live in the boroughs most hit by the virus and many were from black and ethnic minority groups.“Driving a bus, coach or taxi is among the frontline occupations associated with increased risk of death from Covid-19. Because London was an early centre of the pandemic, it is likely that the increased risk among London bus drivers is associated with exposure,” said Prof Marmot, the director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity.“Our review explicitly suggests that lockdown was the main factor that saved bus drivers’ lives. If lockdown had occurred earlier, it would likely have saved more lives. For those with high blood pressure, exposure to Covid-19 is particularly hazardous, disproportionately affecting drivers of ethnic minority backgrounds. In addition to reducing exposure to the virus, all drivers should therefore be screened for health risk, with those most vulnerable to dying from the virus receiving the most benefit.”Ten bus companies were working for TFL at the start of the pandemic, employing about 30,000 people, of whom 34 reportedly died with Covid-19. Of those, at least 29 were among the 25,000 bus drivers. The report finds there may have been two more, one of whom went off sick in February, while the other died in June.Marmot was asked to look into the reasons and also how bus drivers could be better protected, for instance with better cleaning of vehicles and protective shielding. The latter issues will be part of a later report.Stories emerged of passengers spitting at bus drivers. One man was jailed for 10 months as a result.When the review was announced in May, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said it would “ensure we are taking every possible measure to protect our heroic staff”.The findings are not limited to London. Looking at excess mortality for England and Wales over the period from March to May, it was higher everywhere for bus and coach drivers than other occupations. “There were 70 more deaths to bus and coach drivers in England and Wales than would have been expected, of which 53 deaths included Covid-19 on the death certificate and 17 did not,” says the report.Most of London’s bus drivers stopped working 10 days either side of the lockdown on 23 March, says the report, which suggests they became infected before lockdown. Deaths came down after that date.“In addition to reducing exposure of drivers to infection in their line of work, lockdown reduced overall levels of transmission in London. Had lockdown come earlier it is likely that many fewer bus drivers would have died,” says the report.The team was able to examine death certificates for 13 of the bus drivers. In seven cases, high blood pressure or hypertension was a contributory factor. “This may be indicative of both the sedentary nature of bus driving and work stress,” says the report.“The implications are twofold. It is especially important to protect drivers, firstly, from infection because of the high background risk to health related to their job, deprivation and demographic characteristics and, secondly, to focus on prevention of hypertension.”A high proportion of the drivers who died were from a BAME background, although the review does not have exact details. “We note the possibility that employment in frontline occupations may contribute to the increased risk of Covid-19 mortality in BAME groups,” it says.They tended to live in poorer areas, where virus levels were high. “A high proportion of deaths were to people living in areas of above average deprivation and three-quarters of those who died lived in the quarter of London boroughs with the highest Covid-19 death rates in April 2020,” it says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89010839d6b970df8feefde7948f42758e65eee2/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba26ed8735b0ebe7f7c0b97b2bfe9562","title":"face mask wearers do not stop washing hands study suggests","story":"Scientists say people unlikely to reduce one Covid-19 measure when adopting anotherWearing face coverings does not appear to lead people to abandon hand hygiene, researchers say, suggesting people may not trade off the benefits of one public health measure against another.Face coverings are now mandatory in many parts of the world, and in England must be worn not only on public transport but also in many shops.While there is little evidence that cloth face coverings protect the wearer from Covid-19, experts say a growing body of research suggests they help to reduce transmission, limiting its spread from wearers to others.Some scientists have raised concerns that the use of face coverings could give wearers a false sense of security and make them less likely to engage in other behaviours that could reduce the spread of coronavirus, such as handwashing and social distancing – a phenomenon known as “risk compensation”.However, researchers say they have looked at existing studies and found little sign that wearing masks reduces adherence to hand hygiene.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Writing in the journal BMJ Analysis, the team report how they looked at 22 systematic reviews exploring the impact of mask wearing on the rate of respiratory viruses other than Covid-19, including flu, finding within them six randomised controlled trials that also looked at hand hygiene.“We don’t have any direct evidence from the current pandemic, so all we have done is look at ‘well what existing evidence is there?’” said Prof Dame Theresa Marteau, a co-author of the research from the University of Cambridge.While the six studies were not specifically designed to look at whether wearing masks influenced handwashing, the team say none showed evidence that mask-wearing was linked to a reduction in hand hygiene – as measured by self report and also, in four of the studies, by the volume of soap or sanitiser used. Indeed two of the studies suggested mask-wearing may even increase hand hygiene.Marteau said while the research only covered six studies, the results chimed with other research, also highlighted by the team, that found no clear evidence that interventions such as the use of helmets when skiing or cycling increased risky behaviours.“That’s not to say risk compensation doesn’t exist – it certainly exists at an inidual level … But we can’t find any good evidence for risk compensation happening at a population level,” she said. She said there was no sign that wearing face coverings increased transmission of Covid-19, as may be expected if risk compensation was rife.“The concept of risk compensation, rather than risk compensation itself, seems the greater threat to public health through delaying potentially effective interventions,” the team wrote.Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, welcomed the study.Dr Julian Tang, an honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said the research was important in raising awareness of the “myth” of risk compensation for mask-wearing.“Whilst the authors accept that inidual variation is possible, the overall impact of mask-wearing to the population is more likely to be more beneficial than not,” he said.However, some warn there has been little research into people’s behaviour regarding actions such as mask-wearing and social distancing – or how different behaviours influence each other – and it is not clear how the team picked the studies.Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, was among those sounding a note of caution: “It certainly seems premature to claim that risk compensation theory has been ‘laid to rest’ or that the concern should not be taken seriously in better-designed and more balanced studies of this intervention.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74466f3282dde87338d01aeeaf1803ab8e11784f/0_0_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29e937f19122ac33637961d53fc87d0","title":"germany most admired country in the world as us china and russia vie for second place gallup poll","story":"Annual Gallup survey casts doubt on Mike Pompeo’s claim that the US is ‘perfectly positioned’ to lead the free world in rivalry with China Germany is the most admired country in the world for the third year running, leaving the US in a tight battle for distant second place with China and Russia, according to a new global leadership poll.The annual poll, conducted by Gallup, casts more doubt on US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s claim on Friday that the US was “perfectly positioned” to lead the free world in a new ideological rivalry with the Chinese Communist Party.The survey of a thousand adults in each of 135 countries was carried out around the world in 2019, before coronavirus struck.

This is the resounding message that young Europeans have delivered to their leaders over the past two years. To be sure, the wave of young climate activists across the continent, from Fridays for Future to Extinction Rebellion, is part of a global response to the climate crisis. But for the EU in particular, it is also a warning from a new generation of Europeans to their leaders: our European identity hinges on your climate policies.For our parents’ generation, the European Union defined itself as a protector of peace, a fortress against fascism and a society of (relative) social security. For our generation – we are in our mid-20s – this narrative does not resonate. We came of age in a Europe of crises: a financial collapse, a panic over migration, a surge of populism. These formative moments gave the lie to the notion of a united European identity. To many of us, the EU appeared less a project of democracy, ersity or solidarity than one of bureaucracy, xenophobia and fracture. What is more, Europe’s responses to these crises were hardly material for a new common narrative. Just the opposite: the responses were the crises.Hollow narratives cannot endure they undermine themselves. If EU leaders and national governments continue to soft-pedal and greenwash, they will forfeit the already fragile faith of our generation. This loss of faith has already begun: our generation has not failed to notice the discrepancy between EU leaders’ exemplary commitment to climate action on paper and their delays and obfuscations in practice. Our polling for Europe’s Stories suggests that just over half of young Europeans think authoritarian states are better equipped to tackle the climate crisis than democracies – a worrisome but perhaps unsurprising trend that speaks to how urgently young Europeans want climate action, and to the failure of European democracies to meet the moment.These measures would set Europe on a path to a just transition: from the third-largest polluter in the world to a genuine climate leader. They would also help to craft a new and durable European identity for a new generation of Europeans. It is up to Europe’s leaders to recognise, before it is too late, that the latter cannot succeed without the former. To save Europe, they will have to save the planet.• Daniel Judt, Reja Wyss and Antonia Zimmermann are graduate students and members of the Europe’s Stories project team at Oxford University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4314069.1595786115!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"backpedalling on pandemic cycling and walking schemes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe pedestrianisation of New Street in Malahide is currently midway through a 10-week trial. Photograph: Orla Murray If there is any silver lining for Dublin to the health and economic disaster of the coronavirus pandemic, it has to be the emergence of measures to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists.Dublin City Council was first out of the traps in the repurposing of road space, annexing on-street parking spaces to widen footpaths and installing segregated cycle paths throughout the city, most notably on the Liffey quays, a scheme it had failed to get going for the previous eight years. The Office of Public Works (OPW) closed all but two of the Phoenix Park gates and banned all parking in the park at the end of March. Initially this was not a cycling or walking-driven measure, but to deter people from breaking the 2km travel restriction. However, as Covid-19 restrictions eased it became more about creating a better atmosphere for people to enjoy the park’s amenities. This was made most explicit when it decided not to reopen the peripheral gates as planned on June 29th to “curb traffic volumes” and maintain “safe, quiet, open spaces for pedestrians and cyclists to enjoy”.However, less than two weeks later, on a Thursday evening, the OPW announced the peripheral gates would reopen the following morning. This decision, made by the newly-appointed Minister of State for the OPW Patrick O’Donovan, was never about facilitating access to the park.What the closure of the gates did make less attractive was the use of the park as a rat run or a commuter route. That this was the real focus of the reversal was made clear when O’Donovan said the park was a thoroughfare in to the city for motorists from as far away as Longford and Westmeath. As the city and country reopens, perhaps it is understandable car users would rail against the very considerable changes to their pre-pandemic routine. Anne Crawford owns one of the few businesses operating in the Phoenix Park, an afterschool childcare service located in the special school on the north side of the park, close to the Hole in the Wall pub. She agrees the gate closures had limited impact on those coming to the park for leisure trips, but says they represented a serious inconvenience for working people.Many of these parents would come from the Navan Road direction, so would have no reason to venture into the centre of the park when they can use the Cabra and Ashtown gates, she said.“All the parents were going ballistic. These people sitting in traffic jams are the people going to work and paying taxes for the upkeep of the park, not the people sitting in the park on the €350 pandemic payment saying it’s all so lovely without the cars.”Crawford also runs afterschool facilities in nearby Castleknock and Ashtown and said traffic on the roads around both areas improved when the gates reopened. It would be “fair enough” to close the gates if there were adequate public transport options, she said. “The 37 bus only comes every 20 minutes and even before Covid the trains were packed and now the capacity is reduced. Working people need to be able to drive from one side of the park to the other, not just from Castleknock to Parkgate Street.”While the reopening of the gates has come as a great relief, she is concerned there may be attempts to reverse the decision. “I know the Green Party wants to close them again, but there will be uproar if they do, particularly when the schools – Mount Sackville and Castleknock College – reopen.”Crawford says she doesn’t really understand the argument for banning cars from peripheral roads and gates. “There are 1,700 acres here and only very few roads. You don’t have to be anywhere near the cars if you don’t want to be.” Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie said the singular focus on the gates as a solution to traffic management in the park has been misguided.“The conversation has become quite polarised, you’re either for or against the gates being open, when it should be a conversation about how to retain the best of the park while making sure it is accessible.”Sudden changes to park access without consultation and the continuing use of what had been billed as an emergency measure at the start of the pandemic travel restrictions, was what had annoyed residents, she said.“The OPW can’t just close the gates and hope for the best. They must develop a transport strategy for the park that includes public transport options to minimise people’s need to drive in the park. Last year they said they would conduct a mobility strategy for the park, they need to do that and start the public consultation on that as soon as possible.”Currie said she did not directly advise O’Donovan of her concerns regarding the gates but did speak in the Seanad on the matter.In Chapelizod, another community on the periphery of the park, some residents started an online petition, a week or so before the Minister made his decision, calling for the gates to be reopened. They cited traffic congestion outside and inside the park, as well as suggesting the lack of cars in the park would mean parts of the park would become “no-go areas due to their isolation”.The petition attracted more than 1,600 signatures, with more added since the gates reopened. Green Party Councillor Michael Pidgeon had earlier in the pandemic used the same online platform to seek support to end through traffic in the park. His petition secured more than 7,500 signatures and also continues to attract more. He was disappointed by O’Donovan’s decision. “The OPW had been extolling the benefits of keeping the gates closed, so it’s clear that the Minister ordered the change personally.”He agrees with Currie that an “onoff approach to the park isn’t in anyone’s interest” and says a short consultation process based on an options paper should be pursued. Pidgeon remains of the view that most people, on all sides of the debate, want to see less traffic in the park, insisting that the Phoenix Park is “not just some roads with trees on the side”.Not all local residents’ groups wanted the gates reopened. Pat Allison of the Navan Road Community Council, which has represented residents living to the north of the park for more than 50 years, said local traffic build-up appeared to be more a result of shops reopening than the gates being closed. Some of those arguing for the reopening may have simply wanted to avoid the M50 toll, she said. “The park is not a thoroughfare. It is a garden for the city of Dublin, much appreciated by many families confined to flatland.” MalahideIn a similar spirit of sunny optimism, Fingal County Council took the decision to pedestrianise a street in Malahide as part of its Covid- 19 mobility measures.While the council has converted parking spaces into footpaths to enable social distancing and improved cycling infrastructure in a number of towns and villages, New Street in the north Dublin village is the only one to be fully pedestrianised. The council’s senior executive engineer Andrew Nolan said the project involved considerable research, planning and consultation. Vehicular access for emergency services, deliveries, residents and businesses with private off-street parking was maintained, and additional parking spaces were provided in a nearby car park to compensate for the lack of on-street parking. There was “extensive daily on-site engagement with residents’ businesses” as planters and outdoor seating was installed, he said.Malahide Chamber of Commerce president Derek Fowler, who owns a pub on New Street, said the pedestrianisation has made a dramatic difference to the street. “It’s given it a real facelift and brought many more people to the street. I’ve never seen as many people on the street and they all seem really happy.”The street certainly looks vibrant, with an almost continental feel when the sun is shining and people are eating at outdoor tables. However, the atmosphere is somewhat dampened by the red and yellow Save Malahide Village posters in many windows.New Street pharmacist Áine McCabe said more than 40 local businesses wanted the pedestrianisation ended because of what they said are “significant knock-on traffic problems”.Shop Malahide, the advocacy group behind the campaign, is not “anti-cycling or anti-walking”, she insisted. “That could not be further from the truth. We very much welcome the visitors and residents who cycle and walk to the village and the custom they bring. We believe there is a balance to be struck between facilitating the needs of cyclists and ensuring that traffic flows easily.”The campaign had advocated for a “shared space” scheme, where car parking would be removed and space reallocated to cyclists and walkers. However consultation was “inadequate” she says and the scheme was presented as a “fait accompli” to businesses. “This is a plan they’ve had in their back pocket for a long time and they are using the guise of Covid to push it through.”The council’s director of services David Storey is flummoxed by the group’s opposition. “Shop Malahide were at a stakeholders’ meeting on May 19th where this was approved. They were in favour of it and subsequently they came out a week later and went a different route. We are the ones being vilified but they are the ones who changed their mind. It’s completely disingenuous.”The pedestrianisation of New Street is currently midway through a 10-week trial. “We are actively looking to work with stakeholders and if there was agreement, I would like to continue it beyond the 10 weeks,” Mr Storey said.The council began the Blackrock scheme at the end of May. After seeking public feedback on the progress to date, it said three quarters of submissions were positive and fewer than 20 per cent negative.The Dublin Cycling Campaign, always first in the crosshairs if there are shots to be fired at cyclists, has also encountered surprisingly little negative reaction.“There has been a small amount of negative feedback online, but the majority has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Oisín O’Connor, the campaign’s Dún Laoghaire Rathdown spokesman.“There was a bit of grumbling about traffic issues in Dún Laoghaire, but that’s to be expected while there are roadworks ongoing. They’ve had to close both sides of the coast road in some sections to be able to do the works safely. Once the works are finished, the one lane along the coast will reopen and things will get better as people get used to it.”Retail Excellence managing director Duncan Graham puts the success of the measures down to consultation, and maintaining accessibility.“There has to be engagement with stakeholders, meaningful consultation with traders if any of these schemes are going to work. In Blackrock, traders could see wider footpaths for queuing outside shops were needed, and everyone got a new bike during lockdown, it was like Christmas,” he said.“So it was easy to get across the logic of better spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. But crucially, even though it is one way, there is still ample street parking and accessibility has been maintained.”Dublin City Council, which trialled the pedestrianisation of several streets around Grafton Street at the weekend, has not had to deal with any serious opposition to its pedestrian and cycle measures so far, apart from the odd legal letter from multistorey car park owners. However, as Fingal and the OPW have seen, opposition might be festering, even if the sores have yet to break out.Suggestions that could change Dublin for the better"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: Litter in space is a growing problem, and represents a long-standing indifference to caring for the environmentMinister wants local authorities to re-orientate streets towards pedestrians, cyclists and public transportIreland is set to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps by 2030"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File  photograph: Eric Luke The East Derry DUP MP Gregory Campbell has been criticised by Sinn Féin for a revisiting of his “curried yoghurt” comments about the Irish language.Sinn Féin Assembly member Emma Sheerin described as “crass and offensive” a Facebook comment posted by Mr Campbell about an Irish language BBC programme broadcast on Sunday night.The documentary, Nazi sa Ghaeltacht, made by BBC journalist Kevin Magee told the story of German scholar Prof Ludwig Mühlhausen who before World War II went to Donegal to learn Irish while allegedly also secretly gathering information for a potential invasion of Ireland by Hitler’s German army.The programme also recounted how he went on to broadcast Nazi propaganda to Ireland during the war.Mr Campbell in his Facebook post wrote he was informed that “BBC 2 had a programme on tonight about a suspected German spy who lived in the RoI during the war.“The humorous bit was that he was supposed to have spoken Irish with a German accent,” said Mr Campbell.Mr Campbell appeared unable to resist adding, “I vill not be tempted to ask vot is dis curried yoghurt, mein herr.”Some people commenting on his post found it amusing but others were critical, viewing it as a repeat of his 2014 remarks in the Northern Assembly when he said to the speaker, “curry my yoghurt, a can coca colyer.”This was seen as a semi-phonetic parody of, “Go raibh maith agat, a Ceann Comhairle.”It caused considerable controversy at the time and led to charges that the DUP was being deliberately disrespectful to both the Irish language and Irish people. It also galvanised Irish language activists campaigning for an Irish language Act. Such legislation is promised in January’s New Decade, New Approach deal that restored the Northern Executive and Assembly after a three-year collapse.Part of the reason for that collapse was blamed by Sinn Féin on issues such as the DUP’s attitude to the Irish language.Mr Campbell’s short Facebook post comes at a time when relations between the DUP and Sinn Féin are strained, particularly over the claim that Sinn Féin breached social distancing regulations at the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey. Sinn Féin MLA Ms Sheerin responded on Monday by accusing Mr Campbell of “attempting to mock the Irish language” and describing his comments as “crass, offensive and despicable”.“Sadly, this is not the first time Gregory Campbell has insulted the Irish language community with his offensive anti-Irish mockery. These comments are reminiscent of 2014,” she said. “When the Assembly was restored in January, DUP leader Arlene Foster said identities should be respected. Perhaps Gregory Campbell needs to reflect on the words of his party leader,” she added. “It is long past the time that disrespect like this is allowed to go unchallenged and time the DUP genuinely embraced equality and respect,” added Ms Sheerin.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4314691.1595854450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"from one wet weekend to another with a little sunshine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShoppers carry umbrellas on Dublin’s Grafton Street on Sunday. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsIt was a poor weekend weather-wise, and it is likely to be followed by another disappointment for sun seekers, next weekend. That is according to the latest forecast from Met Éireann which said temperatures for the last two weeks were up to about 1.9 degrees lower than normal for this time of year, with more than the average rainfall. On Monday, dry and bright weather with sunny spells will extend from the west throughout the early afternoon - but isolated showers will follow. Highest temperatures of 15 to 19 degrees will be below average highs of 17 to 20 degrees for this time of year.Brisk northwest breezes will develop giving coolest conditions along Atlantic coasts. Tuesday is expected to be a mostly dry day with sunny spells. However, cloud will again build in the afternoon giving scattered showers, again with most of these across Atlantic counties. Met Éireann said it would be “cool for the time of year highest temperatures of 14 to 17 degrees in moderate, occasionally fresh, west to northwest breezes”. Temperatures will be a little on the cool side of average early on, but becoming warm and humid later.Wednesday will start out mostly dry with hazy sunshine in the north and east. However, it will become cloudy across the southwest and west with outbreaks of rain and drizzle moving in off the Atlantic, very gradually spreading elsewhere later. Relatively cool with highest temperatures of 14 to 17 degrees Celsius, in light to moderate southerly breezes. The best of the weather looks set to arrive on Thursday and Friday. It is set to be dry for Thursday across most areas with warm spells of sunshine. Highest temperatures of 19 to 23 degrees Celsius, in southerly breezes. Friday should be an overall dry day, with hazy sunny spells and temperatures hitting 24 degrees in some areas. However Met Éireann said the indications suggest temperatures will slip back again this weekend.Joanna Donnelly, meteorologist and forecaster at Met Éireann and author of The Great Irish Weather Book cautioned against dismal summaries of the weather so far in July, in absence of the monthly summary, which is due out in a few days’ time. Ms Donnelly said Ireland was noted for the variety in its weather, with the west - around Galway to Donegal - taking the brunt of rain and cloud from the Atlantic Ocean, while the sunny south east, around Wexford and Wicklow could generally expect to have the sunniest spells. “ We are on the north east edge of the warmest ocean, in a warm current of air, which keeps us a lot warmer than places such as Labrador and Newfoundland”, she said. “It shouldn’t be too bad in the south of the country from Wednesday” at least until the weekend, she added.

Photograph: Kate GeraghtyThe The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has questioned the legality of controversial checks being carried out at airports to identify travellers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment. The organisation’s executive director, Liam Herrick, claimed the checks on passengers to establish if they were in receipt of the PUP weekly payment of up to €350 were discriminatory without any real justification being offered by the Government for their use.The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has confirmed that it has cut off the PUP payment of more than 100 people who had travelled abroad since July 7th as a result of checks carried out at airports.The ICCL said it had received reports since the start of July of passengers at airports being asked for the PPS numbers.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Herrick said it seemed that a statutory instrument signed into law by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Heather Humphreys, on July 10th meant that travel advice issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs effectively had a legal impact on one section of society.“It’s just advice for one section of the population but it actually has the force of law for another section - those that are dependent on social welfare payments,” Mr Herrick said. He added: “It has changed the definition of what is an allowable holiday.”Mr Herrick said statutory instruments should only be introduced where they operated within the principles of primary legislation.“There is no primary legislation about the travel advice,” he observed.Mr Herrick said comments made by the Tánaiste, Leo Varadkar on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics at the weekend about the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection getting information from the airports raised questions about where the information came from and how it was lawfully obtained and shared.He said the ICCL supported efforts to tackle social welfare fraud but that was not what was at issue with the checks at airports.“We are talking of people being cut off because they have gone on holidays even though it is not unlawful to go on holidays,” Mr Herrick said.He claimed there was no way members of the public could have reasonably known the rules had changedMr Herrick said the State had made a policy decision not to restrict people travelling in and out of Ireland but now seemed to have introduced a restriction on people dependent on social welfare.He pointed out that the PUP had been introduced to maintain a connection between someone temporarily laid off work and their employer.“They are not required to be seeking work on an ongoing basis,” said Mr Herrick.He added: “Something that is not law is being elevated to the level of law but only for one section of the population. That gives rise to profound questions about freedom of movement and discrimination.”The ICCL has called on the Government to clarify if the Cabinet had made a decision to introduce the checks on passengers at airports and whether it had received advice from the Attorney General on the measure.Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney, Fianna Fáil TD Willie O’Dea also criticised the measure and said it made very little difference in practice as the overwhelming majority of people travelling abroad could afford to do so.On the same programme, Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Louise O’Reilly, said there was no suggestion people on the PUP were “living it up”.Ms O’Reilly said the Government was responsible for the confusion over travel advice after providing “a lot of mixed messages”.“They should not cut off a person’s only source of income because they have left the country.

Photograph: Arthur EllisPress22Almost 6,000 air passengers are flying into Ireland every day, with nearly a third of arrivals travelling from the UK, latest official figures disclose.While numbers are dramatically lower than normal for the time of year, there has been a steady increase over recent weeks in visitors arriving through Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.In the week July 13th to July 19th, at least 36, 931 passengers touched down at Dublin Airport, from 35 different countries, including the UK (10,743), Spain (4,965), France (2,137) and the Netherlands (2,041).Some 1,122 passengers arrived from the US at Dublin Airport during the period.The overall number of arrivals was up almost 30 per cent from the previous week (28,603) and up nearly 60 per cent on the preceding week (23,156), when more flights were put on at the beginning of the month.The numbers only cover those who are visiting Ireland and do not include other passengers who are transferring through Dublin onto onward flights.During the same week, some 2,846 passengers arrived at Cork Airport –- more than half (1,566) from the UK, with Spain (450), Poland (363) and France (120) the next most popular departure countries. Overall weekly arrival numbers at Cork have increased almost 65 per cent since the first week of the month (1,731).At Shannon Airport, weekly passenger numbers jumped more than 80 per cent over the same time period, from 836 to 1,522. Again, the UK (772) accounted for the largest number of arrivals, followed by Spain (332), Poland (238) and Lithuania (70).Parliamentary questionThe figures were released by Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport Eamon Ryan in response to a parliamentary question by Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae.Mr Ryan said State airports remained open during the Covid-19 crisis “to ensure critical supply chains have been able to remain operational, and citizens have been able to return home”.He was unable to provide a breakdown of the arrivals into Ireland by those who were returning home and those who were foreign visitors.“While our three State airports have seen some increases in operations since more passenger flights resumed on the first of July, passenger numbers still remain low,” he said. At Dublin Airport, nine million passengers are expected in 2020 (compared to over 32 million passengers in 2019).He said numbers at both Cork and Shannon were down by about 90 per cent over the same time last year.Mr Ryan was also unable to detail the original departure countries of nearly 14,000 passengers who arrived in Ireland through sea ports in recent weeks.Between June 29th and July 12th, some 10,046 passengers disembarked ferries from the UK at Dublin Port. Another 2,264 arrived at Rosslare from the UK, while 1,483 visitors got off ferries from Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Spain at either Rosslare or Cork.Last week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney suggested further travel restrictions could be introduced for visitors arriving from Covid-19 “hot spots”.Currently, visitors from all but 15 European countries and territories on the so-called “green list” published earlier this month only have to fill out a passenger locator form and agree to spend 14 days in quarantine at a confirmed address on arriving in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Experts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: Tyler HicksThe New York TimesThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has topped 16 million.According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, the US leads the count with more than 4.1 million confirmed cases, followed by 2.3 million in Brazil and 1.3 million in India.The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported a record number of 284,196 new cases of the disease worldwide on Friday and 284,083 new cases on Saturday – the highest volume since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.Here are updates on the pandemic from across the world:Quarantine rowSpain’s government has insisted the country is safe for tourists and Spaniards, after the UK on Sunday abruptly imposed a two-week quarantine on travellers returning from Spain, a decision that filled holidaymakers with dismay. Meanwhile, an investigation by El País newspaper published on Sunday showed that Spain’s Covid-19 death toll could be nearly 60 per cent higher than the official figure of 28,432.In the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 4,163,892 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 64,582 cases from its previous daily count, and said the number of deaths from the disease had risen by 929 to 145,942. Prior to Sunday the US had recorded more than 1,000 deaths a day from Covid-19 for five days running.The US state of Florida recorded 9,300 new coronavirus cases, becoming the second state after California to overtake New York, which was the worst-hit state in terms of cases at the start of the US outbreak, according to a Reuters tally. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in the Senate are set to unveil a $1 trillion US coronavirus relief Bill on Monday that includes reduced federal unemployment benefits, with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin saying he believes they can work with Democrats to move quickly on the legislation.Meanwhile, the health minister of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, Dr Jesus Grajeda, has died, Chihuahua’s governor said on Sunday, nearly two weeks after Dr Grajeda was hospitalised with Covid-19. Tourist seasonThe latest uptick in cases in many European countries appears to have coincided with the start of the summer tourist season. The surge highlights the dilemma facing policymakers: on one hand they fear reimposing a shutdown that has devastated their economies, but on the other they worry the return of mass travel will trigger a second wave of the pandemic.In North Korea, leader Kim Jong-un said he believes “the vicious virus” may have entered the country, and placed the city of Kaesong, near the border with South Korea, under total lockdown after a person was found with suspected Covid-19 symptoms.Mr Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the North’s KCNA state news reported.A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that ides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symptoms of Covid-19, KCNA reported.“An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the South three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus, returned on July 19th after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.China reported 46 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest such daily tally in more than a month, as it took steps to stem recent outbreaks that have infected more than 160 people at opposite ends of the country.China has recorded 83,830 cases and 4,634 deaths since the pandemic began. The National Health Commission said that 288 patients remain in treatment, including 18 in a critical condition.Record tollIn Australia, Victoria state recorded 10 deaths overnight – its highest such daily toll amid a continuing surge in cases.State premier Daniel Andrews said the deaths included seven men and three women, including a man in his 40s.Elsewhere, Vietnam reintroduced social distancing measures in the central city of Danang after the country reported four locally transmitted coronavirus cases over the past two days.Iran on Sunday reported another 216 fatalities and 2,333 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising its death toll to 15,700 from 291,172 known cases. The level of infection is “red” over most of Iran, as one in five deaths in the country is linked to Covid-19, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on state TV.Morocco will stop people entering and leaving some of its biggest cities from midnight to contain a surge in Covid-19 cases, the interior and health ministries said on Sunday. The cities to be locked down include the economic powerhouse of Casablanca as well as Tangier, Marrakech, Fez and Meknes. The country eased a nationwide lockdown a month ago, though international flights are still suspended, except for special flights by national airlines carrying Moroccans or foreign residents. On Sunday, the Moroccan health ministry said 633 new Covid-19 cases were recorded, one of its biggest daily rises so far, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 20,278, with 313 deaths. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet.

Photograph: David Dee DelgadoNew York TimesPresident Donald Trump is oh so proud of having mastered the ability to intone, “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” But the more pressing issue is whether he is a person who can master talking to women through a TV camera without sounding like a caveman.We continually debate whether Trump is a madman, but there’s no doubt he’s a Mad Man. He’s a ring-a-ding-ding guy, stuck in a time warp redolent of Vegas with the Rat Pack in 1959, talking about how “broads” and “skirts” rate. He was in his element bro-ing out with Dave Portnoy in an interview for Barstool Sports that aired on Friday.Trump’s idea of wooing the women’s vote, which is decisive in this election, was to tweet out a New York Post story headlined “Joe Biden’s disastrous plans for America’s suburbs” with the directive: “The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article.”Clearly, the 74-year-old president thinks that American women are in the kitchen clutching their pearls, a la June Cleaver sheltered in the ’burbs in their gingham aprons waiting for their big, brave breadwinners to come home after a hard day’s work manhandling their secretaries.Trump believes that the coveted electoral cohort that used to be known as soccer moms are actually sucker moms, naive enough to fall for his shtick that the unleashed forces of urban America are marching towards their manicured lawns. How perfect that the president – whose personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, got in trouble over his boss’s porn-star payout – wants to protect the desperate housewives of America.In a speech on drug prices last Friday, Trump took his strange brand of feminism for a spin, pausing while he talked about middlemen profiting in the Big Pharma arena to say “and women, I guess”. On the Bulwark, a conservative website, Sarah Longwell wrote about her three years’ worth of focus groups with women who voted for Trump in 2016.Lack of compassionShe found that they chose Trump over Hillary Clinton because they did not like Clinton and because they felt that Bill Clinton’s bad behaviour with women cancelled out Trump’s bad behaviour with women. But the relationship with women voters has soured, not only because of his pugnacity and bullying but also because of his lack of compassion and competence dealing with the coronavirus and painful issues about race.“They don’t see Trump as someone who can protect them from the chaos,” Longwell wrote. “They think he’s the source of it.” And his party is on board with the antediluvian vibe. R-Misogyny. Even on the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote, Republicans can’t help themselves. It feels strange to be typing something positive in a sentence with the word Cheney in it, but it was disturbing to see a bunch of MAGA bros in Congress beat up on Liz Cheney because, among other offences to the cult of Trump, she defended Dr Anthony Fauci and shaded Trump on his denial regarding the virus by tweeting a picture of her father in a mask with the hashtag “realmenwearmasks”.One Trump disciple in the House, Republican Matt Gaetz, tweeted that “Liz Cheney has worked behind the scenes (and now in public) against @realDonald Trump and his agenda.” He added, “Liz Cheney should step down or be removed.”Donald Trump jnr chimed in on Twitter, “We already have one Mitt Romney, we don’t need another.” (Of course, while it feels strange to be typing something positive in a sentence with the word Trump in it, Donald Trump jnr was right in his second point: “We also don’t need the endless wars she advocates for.” That point was echoed by the president on Twitter. I would never agree with a Cheney’s mindless hawkishness.)‘F***ing bitch’As Republicans sniped, one Democrat soared. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, tried to slap down Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A reporter overheard him muttering that the congresswoman was “a f***ing bitch” as Yoho walked away after having an argument with her about crime and policing on the steps of the Capitol. Yoho denies he said it.The youngest woman to ever serve in Congress is so full of natural political talent, burning so bright, that the 2020 field seems dull next to her lustre. It was a remarkable moment on Capitol Hill, where for years superachieving women have let such sexist remarks slide.She went to the House floor on Thursday and schooled Yoho the Yahoo and the retrograde crowd. “Mr Yoho mentioned that he has a wife and two daughters,” she said. “I am two years younger than Mr Yoho’s youngest daughter. I am someone’s daughter, too.” She added, “I am here because I have to show my parents that I am their daughter and that they did not raise me to accept abuse from men.”Showing her skill in a generational dimension foreign to Congress until now, AOC posted a video of herself on Instagram Stories strutting to the rap tune Boss Bitch by Doja Cat, her long hair whipping to the music, with the Capitol in the background. “I’m a bitch and a boss, I’m a-shine like gloss.” She captioned it: “Shine on, fight for others, and let the haters stay mad.”And that’s the way you make Paleolithic men understand that they are history.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4314681.1595853289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands of volunteers begin tests of us government s covid 19 vaccine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNnurse preparing to give a patient a vaccine.  Photograph: David CheskinPA WireThe world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccine study got under way with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers helping to test jabs created by the US government.It is one of several candidates in the final stretch of the global vaccine race.There is still no guarantee that the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc, will really protect.Volunteers will not know if they are getting the real shot or a dummy version.After two doses, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus still is spreading unchecked.“Unfortunately for the United States of America, we have plenty of infections right now” to get that answer, NIH’s Dr Anthony Fauci recently said.Several other vaccines made by China and by the University of Oxford earlier this month began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries.But the US requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country and has set a high bar.Every month through autumn, the government-funded Covid-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each one with 30,000 newly recruited volunteers.StudiesThe massive studies are not just to test if the jabs – they are needed to check each potential vaccine’s safety.And following the same study rules will let scientists eventually compare all the shots.Next up in August, the final study of the Oxford shot begins, followed by plans to test a candidate from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson in September and Novavax in October if all goes according to schedule.Pfizer Inc plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.That is a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science.But in recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signalling interest, said Dr Larry Corey, a virologist with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute in Seattle, who helps oversee the study sites.“These trials need to be multi-generational, they need to be multi-ethnic, they need to reflect the ersity of the United States population,” Dr Corey told a vaccine meeting last week.He stressed that it was especially important to ensure enough black and Hiic participants as those populations are hard-hit by Covid-19.It normally takes years to create a new vaccine from scratch, but scientists are setting speed records this time around, spurred by knowledge that vaccination is the world’s best hope against the pandemic.The coronavirus was not even known to exist before late December, and vaccine makers sprang into action on January 10 when China shared the virus’ genetic sequence.Just 65 days later in March, the NIH-made vaccine was tested in people.The first recipient is encouraging others to volunteer now.“We all feel so helpless right now.“There’s very little that we can do to combat this virus.“And being able to participate in this trial has given me a sense of, that I’m doing something,” Jennifer Haller of Seattle said.“Be prepared for a lot of questions from your friends and family about how it’s going, and a lot of thank-yous.”That first-stage study that included Ms Haller and 44 others showed the jabs revved up volunteers’ immune systems in ways scientists expect will be protective, with some minor side effects such as a brief fever, chills and pain at the injection site.Early testingEarly testing of other leading candidates have had similarly encouraging results.If everything goes right with the final studies, it still will take months for the first data to trickle in from the Moderna test, followed by the Oxford one.Governments around the world are trying to stockpile millions of doses of those leading candidates so if and when regulators approve one or more vaccines, immunisations can begin immediately.But the first available doses will be rationed, presumably reserved for people at highest risk from the virus.“We’re optimistic, cautiously optimistic” that the vaccine will work and that “toward the end of the year” there will be data to prove it, Dr Stephen Hoge, president of Massachusetts-based Moderna, told a House subcommittee last week.Until then, Ms Haller, the volunteer vaccinated back in March, wears a mask in public and takes the same distancing precautions advised for everyone while hoping that one of the jabs in the pipeline pans out.“I don’t know what the chances are that this is the exact right vaccine.“But thank goodness that there are so many others out there battling this right now,” she said. – APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and

It’s all fun and games at the start, but then it starts getting sad,” Sheeran said. “That was probably the lowest that I’ve been and I ballooned in weight. They used to call me ‘two-dinner Teddy’ because I used to order two meals and eat that.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdmitting to hating how he looked, Sheeran also revealed that he struggled with excessive drinking during this period, saying: “I see no point in having a glass of wine. I’d rather have two bottles. Having a glass of wine is having something in moderation and probably isn’t going to affect your day the next day. But two bottles of wine probably might make you quite sad.“I felt, ‘What was the point?’ In a dark way, like, ‘Why am I around?

For someone who’s been in this glaring spotlight for 15 years, it’s really liberating to have some privacy and work on her own terms. She deserves that.”He continued: “At times, if I wanted friends to play on the record, it was a little difficult because you can’t send a file with her vocals. But everyone was cool.“At the end, I reached out to some wizards just to add bits, and that was nice. It was kind of fun: ‘What? Why can’t you tell me, Aaron?’ Then they start guessing. Everyone made a game out of it.”As well as Dessner, Swift collaborated with Bon Iver and songwriter Jack Antonoff on the record.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Japan\u0027s economy minister says the government will urge businesses to aim for 70 per cent telecommuting and enhance other social distancing measures amid a rise in coronavirus cases among workers, some infected during after-work socialising.Though Japan has largely avoided the mass infections that have killed tens of thousands overseas, a record surge in cases during the past week in Tokyo and other major urban areas has experts worried the country faces a second wave.Yasutoshi Nishimura, the economy minister, late on Sunday called on business leaders to enhance anti-virus measures such as encouraging the level of telecommuting achieved during Japan\u0027s state of emergency this year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTokyo last week reported a daily record of 366 cases, with 239 on Sunday. The southern city of Fukuoka reported a record 90 cases on Sunday, along with rising numbers in Osaka.“At one point, commuter numbers were down by 70 to 80 per cent, but now it\u0027s only about 30 per cent,” Mr Nishimura said. “We really don\u0027t want to backtrack on this, so we have to explore new ways of working and keep telecommuting high.”Japan criticised for launching tourism campaign amid coronavirus surge‘Kiss only your partner’: Japan suggests new Covid nightlife rulesJapan furious after massive coronavirus outbreak at US military basesHe also called on companies to avoid large gatherings and to urge staggered shifts.Mr Nishimura said last week that concern was rising about clusters, specifically those involving host and hostess bars as well as others connected to workplaces and after-work socialising.Though the number of serious cases remains relatively small, the government is also concerned about a rise in infections among people in their 40s and 50s.The rate of telecommuting has lagged in Japan because of a paper-driven culture and technological shortcomings, experts say.The central government remains determined to restart economic activity and last week launched a domestic travel campaign in the face of widespread criticism.Millions warned to evacuate as Japan battered by severe floodingNearly 40 feared dead amid mudslides and flooding in JapanBut Tokyo was omitted from the plan and Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike called on the city\u0027s residents to stay home during a four-day weekend starting Thursday.More than 30,000 people in Japan have been infected and nearly 1,000 have died.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Officials in Wuhan removed “crucial evidence” from a seafood market thought to be the centre of the Covid-19 pandemic, a leading microbiologist has claimed.Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, whose team identified the Sars virus in 2003, said he suspects that authorities deliberately attempted to “cover up” the source of the outbreak that has now infected more than 16 million people around the world and claimed 694,000 lives.In an interview with the BBC’s Panorama: China’s Coronavirus Cover-Up programme, to be broadcast on Monday evening, Prof Yuen, of Hong Kong University, said Huanan Seafood Market had been disinfected before a team of scientists was allowed to investigate the site.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I do suspect that they have been doing some cover-up locally at Wuhan,” Prof Yuen told the programme. “The local officials who are supposed to be immediately relaying the information has not allowed this to be done as rapidly as it should.”In early January, genetic sequencing revealed that the mysterious new illness spreading through the city closely resembled the SARS virus, which killed more than 700 people.By 18 January , Prof Yuen diagnosed a family of seven living in Shenzen, some 700 miles away from Wuhan. Some of the family members had just returned from Wuhan.But Prof Yuen said Beijing contined to play down the seriousness of the new respiratory disease, despite evidence of human transmission.“I know how efficient the virus was spreading and I know that it is acquired in hospital and I know that it can go with people by flights from one city, thousands of miles away,” he added.Prof Yuen then joined a team of high-profile Chinese scientists who were sent to Wuhan on 18 January.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, you may say that the crime scene is already disturbed.“Because the Seafood Market was cleared…we cannot identify the animal host…which has given the virus to humans.”Professor Andrew Tatem, of Southampton University, has been studying mobile phone data which shows people’s movements in and out of the Wuhan area before a lockdown was imposed.He said earlier action could have made a critical difference.Muslim women cook meals for poor in Melbourne amid Covid lockdownHe told Panorama: “If the same interventions that were put in place on 23 January had been put in place on 2 January, we may have seen a 95 per cent reduction in the number of cases.”Professor Li Lanjuan was a key adviser to the Chinese government in the early stages of the outbreak and recommended the lockdown. She told Panorama: “The lockdown was a grave decision. It was only made when we felt that the epidemic in Wuhan would threaten the entire country.”China has said it shouldn’t be blamed for coronavirus and it is a victim too. Official claimed they have acted at all times with “openness and transparency”.Official in China said they “provided information to the WHO and relevant countries in a timely fashion”. China agreed to join an international inquiry into the pandemic but only after the crisis is over.Dr Bernhard Schwartländer, Chef de Cabinet, World Health Organisation, said: “We stand ready to come with the best experts around the world to work together with our Chinese counterparts to really understand, to try to understand, where this virus has come from as a basis to make the world safer as we move forward.”It comes as the coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of slowing down, with large numbers of deaths and cases being recorded in the US, India and much of South America.Elsewhere, China recorded its biggest rise in cases since April, while Australia recorded its worst ever daily infection tally as authorities continue to grapple with multiple outbreaks in Melbourne.India has recorded nearly 50,000 new daily cases of Covid-19, the highest daily tally so far, according to the ministry of health and family welfare.Global infections stand at just under 16.2 million, with nearly 650,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins figures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess. Finding all the mixtapes I made for girlfriends who’d just left me, and reliving the sadness to the accompaniment of Phil Collins.DAVID BECKHAM wishes to build a pond in his back garden, which is good news for insects, birds and wildle in general, but apparently it’s not such good news for his neighbours, who say there are already too many ponds in the area so another is not neededToo many ponds  I think what they meant to say is: “We are bitter and so twisted with jealousy that we want to make Mr Beckham’s le as miserable as ours have turned out to be.”OVER the past few years, cigarette sales in Britain have plummeted by million a month.Experts are struggling to understand why there has been such a massive fall and why it happened so quickly.Some say the health warnings are being effective.

It would have been deeply embarrassing had it later turned out that Christian B was indeed the person who took Madeleine.”Christian B, , is currently serving a -month sentence in his home country of Germany for drug offences.The serial sex offender is also facing a separate sentence for the rape of a -year-old American woman on a waterfront villa less than a mile from where Madeleine went missing in Portugal in .Although he was convicted in December , he appealed against his seven-year sentence and so it cannot be imposed until his appeal avenues are exhausted. However, there remains hope that police may be able to bring a case against Christian B.Mr Hofman said: In my view, there is no doubt he was at the scene.“Mobile phone data proves he was by the apartments. Also, his record fits the profile.“I’m sure the prosecutor will pull an ace from up his sleeve and have more than we know so far.”Hans Christian Wolters, the chief prosecutor in the case, has insisted that the Christian B is their man and they can place him at the scene.However, no charges have yet been filed against Christian B, who has a record of sex offences and is now being linked to other missing children.Madeleine is believed to have been snatched from the Ocean Club apartment where she was sleeping alongside her twin siblings Sean and Amelie on May , , in Praia du Luz.Described as a twisted loner, the sex offender is understood to have been a kind of drter around the resort at the time.Christian B was first linked to the Madeleine case after he allegedly made a drunken boast he snatched her while in a bar on the tenth anniversary of the crime.Madeleine would have turned  last month, and the family have described the identication of Christian B as potentially very signicant.Experts have said Christian B matches the profile of a Jimmy Savile-style “paraphiliac”, who targets victims of all ages.His ex-lawyer Serafim Vieira has described him as having psychopathic traits and admitted he could be responsible for Madeleines abduction.Christian B had a rundown and dilapidated shack only two miles away from the McCanns holiday let - and is known to have owned a mobile home he boasted could carry drugs and children.However, a series of bungles in the police investigation have cast doubt over whether prosecutors can secure a conviction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The salvo showed they were determined to break with centuries of protocol to do things their way.It set the couple on a collision course with courtiers and senior royals. And it paved the way for “Megxit”, when they left royal le this year.Scobie and Durand say the fiery statement came after “sensitive” Harry began to lash out at anyone who “questioned his new relationship”. The authors, dubbed “cheerleaders” of the couple, write: “He would wonder, ‘Is this about race  Is it snobbery ’ An old friend of Harry’s spent an afternoon gossiping about Meghan, making disparaging remarks about her Hollywood background.“Word got back to Harry, and the prince immediately cut him off.PRINCE Charles will never say anything publicly about what is happening with Harry and the rt between his sons — but privately, he will be very upset.Charles is a very kind, easy-going man. He has been a brilliant father to those boys.He welcomed Meghan and her mother, Doria, into the family, inviting them for tea at Clarence House, and then of course stepping in to walk Meghan down the aisle.The timing and contents of this book will not go down well. Charles, like the Queen, never complains. He didn’t say a word after his orce from Diana, he just got on with working hard for the country.He will be concerned about the UK. In the biggest crisis we’ve faced since World War Two, Harry is thousands of miles away moaning.“If he was willing to confront those close to him, when it came to the media, Harry was poised for an outright war.”The book, Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, insists Charles did not mind the impact on his tour. It claims: “While disappointed that his son didn’t wait for him to come back, Charles also understood that the situation with Meghan had reached a tipping point.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The three other cases involve a -year-old man in Danang, a -year-old boy in the province of Quang Ngai and a -year-old woman in Danang.Vietnam won plaudits for appearing to contain the virus despite being less wealthy than South Korea and Taiwan for example. The country has used a combination of the mass quarantine of tens of thousands, contact-tracing and testing to contain relatively small clusters of the disease. One day after the first two cases were detected in Vietnam, Hanoi suspended flights to Wuhan in late January.Days later, Vietnam closed its ,kmborder with China to all but essential trade and travel and masks were mandatory in all public places by March.Vietnam has recorded  coronavirus cases with zero deaths. A British pilot made a miraculous recovery after spending two months on le support in a Vietnamese hospital. Stephen Cameron, , had been working for Vietnam Airlines when he tested positive for the virus in March. The pilot was believed to be Vietnams most critical coronavirus patient and at one point doctors considered a lung transplant, with his lungs  per cent damaged and non-al.

The child had disappeared from the water.Mr Ye added: The child suddenly disappeared. I was really scared to death at the time.He and fellow villagers searched carefully by the river and found an underground cave on the bank with the childs hand sticking out.Fourteen firefighters rushed to the scene to rescue him in the East China province.Incredibly, the plucky lad had managed to find a space under the earth where there was air so that he could breathe.The firefighters found Mr Ye still gripping his grandsons hand to prevent him being swept away to his death.The authorities said the naturally formed tunnel appeared just wide enough for the boy to keep his head above water, but breaking him out was a huge challenge.Firefighters feared that excavating the riverbank directly above the boys head would cause a potentially dangerous cave-in, so they had to begin by carefully breaking apart the earth nearby.In video of the rescue, they can be seen digging through several inches of thick mud and rock using a crowbar and their bare hands.The boy was freed in just over ten minutes and reunited with his relieved grandad. He did not come to any serious harm, Yongjia County Fire Rescue Brigade reported.Unnamed local officials told Qianjiang Evening News that they were unaware of the existence of the narrow opening, which appeared to be erting river water into an underground cave system.The tunnel has since been sealed to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future, they added.Yongjia authorities attended a similar accident just ten days earlier when a -year-old girl was sucked into a narrow drainage pipe while swimming in a reservoir.Rescuers were only able to free the teen after five hours of drilling and excavating, due to the high flow pressure of the drainage pipe, its small diameter and hard, thick rocks covering it.Sadly, she died during the rescue, reports Yue Niu News.Firefighters who freed the trap girl reminded parents: Summer is the season with a high incidence of drowning, so you must be careful with your children and pay attention to safety.There is a sign near the reservoir warning that swimming is prohibited in dangerous waters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Buy one, get one free promotions on foods high in fat and sugar will end in supermarkets in future under the governmentaposs new obesity crackdown.Yet the announcement comes seven days before a new £m aposEat Out to Help Outapos scheme launches to save restaurants from the impact of coronavirus.The scheme will allow diners to get % off meals, up to £ per head, in participating restaurants on every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August. Care minister Helen Whately was challenged by LBC radio about whether the two schemes were mixed messaging. Told firms like Burger King, McDonaldaposs and Nandoaposs were all taking part, she said: So the Chancellor and the government have taken steps to support the hospitality sector, which we know has been very hard hit by coronavirus, by the lockdown. What we’re saying to the restaurants like Burger King and Nando’s is they need to put the calories for the dferent meals on their menus, so that when you eat out you can make an informed choice. When you’re eating out you can choose what you have and you’ve got the information there to enable you to choose a lower-calorie option. Asked to name a healthy dish from Nando’s she said: “I don’t know the Nandos menu off by heart”. But she added: If you look at the McDonald’s menu, and you can look at this online, you will find that a bigger burger with more patties in it has got far more calories in it than a smaller burger, for instance.  The ban on buy one, get one free offers is one of a string of measures announced today as part of the governmentaposs obesity strategy.

Ad van der Rest admits he aposhates saladapos and had struggled to lose wight - but now the -year-old has lost a massive stone in just  months and completely transformed his le. Adaposs lightbulb moment came as he watched his daughter run the Brighton marathon last year - and while she completed the course, he gasped for breath as he walked the mile from the start to watch her cross the finish line. The married dad-of-three, from Maidenhead in Berkshire, had suffered with asthma for  years. It was so in April  he had to be admitted to hospital to have his lungs ‘washed’ as they were so clogged.  After discovering NHS-backed healthy eating plan Second Nature the following month, ft Ad now tips the scales at just st lb.And instead of getting out of breath while walking he now regularly runs km races and hasn’t used his asthma inhaler since last year. Ad, a HR consultant, said: Iaposm tall and Iaposve always been quite large shaped, large chested. But when you go beyond the largest shirt size and suit size in the shop, clothes become much harder to find. At my heaviest, I was wearing an XXXL.I had tried to eat healthy myself. But I can’t stand salads, and I didn’t want to starve myself. Then I stumbled across Second Nature on Twitter - it was luck.Ad, who lives with his school teacher we Gill, , used to gorge on crisps, Creme eggs, KFC, sausage rolls, pie and chips. He thought nothing of devouring an entire family-size trle to himself. Ad wore an XXXL in clothes and was appalled at the idea of working out, having never stepped foot in a gym Heaposs now down to a size large and regularly runs km several times a week. Having been diagnosed with asthma as a child, Ad - who has lost a third of his body weight - regularly used an inhaler - something which he has been able to reduce since losing weight. He said: I increasingly struggled with my breathing and used to huff and puff just crossing a car park. I was gasping for breath on a daily basis because of my weight. I’ve suffered with a little light asthma for  years, but given my increased weight, my GP prescribed mg immune-suppressant steroids every day so that I could cope. In April , weighing  stone, I had to go into hospital to have my lungs ‘washed’. They were clogged. Think of it like jet washing a car. Thanks to losing weight, I’m down to mg steroids a day and haven’t used my asthma inhaler at all this year, and will be coming off that. Even after his light-bulb moment at -year-old Jasmineaposs marathon, Ad wasnapost sure where to turn for help. He said: I knew there were plenty of diet sheets I could get from my GP, but it didn’t address sugar or feeling hungry. After signing up with Second Nature, which now has , users and is being trialled by the NHS, Ad was sent smart scales and given access to a health coach on a daily basis. He said: I typically eat Greek yoghurt with Alpen for breakfast, lunch is chicken with vegetables, and dinner is omelette or fish or meat with a plate of veggies - carrots, beans, sweetcorn and peppers. The first surprise for me was portion control. My go-to snack was cheese and crackers - I would have up to  in the past. But my health coach advised me to have two - so that was a big revelation. The weightloss model did the job for me - somebody who canapost cook, doesnapost like dieting, doesnapost like salads - and it works. It’s the science behind it - and finding the clever way of doing it the foods that allow the weight to come off. The programme looks to not only ‘rewire’ unhealthy eating habits but also focuses on exercise and sleep. Ad said: I’ve also found I enjoy walking. I grumbled when my steps were increased from , a day to , - now I’m up to ,. ‘After Christmas, I did my first couch to k. I struggled to do a -second run. Last week I did three k runs in one week. How have I lost so much weight  I’ve followed the rules - persistently. That’s it. And it’s worked for me. If I can do it - anyone can do it. Ad lost more than a stone in the first week, and had seen steady weightloss since then. He said: One thing that has kept me motivated was a visual reminder of how much weight I have lost. I have a washing basket, and each time I lost kg in weight, I would put a kg hand weight in the basket, and lt it up to feel how heavy it was. It was a wonderful visual. Then, when it got to kg, I switched it. I put in the amount of kg weights I needed to reach my target weight, and I remove one each time, I lost kg in weight. To start with, my family thought ‘what on earth is he doing, he’ll never stick to this’. But now they’re really pleased. I feel literally  rds of the person I was. Ad also revealed he is pleased to have lost the weight pre-Covid. He said: Whilst the chances of getting into serious trouble remain remote, it’s good to feel physically stronger, healthier and under a much lower level of medication. Covid- and other diseases will remain a risk. I don’t think there is ever a bad time to be losing a few pounds or kilos.

Sophie Hull, , said she and husband Phil, , had to live with family temporarily after they struggled to sleep in their flat. Sophie said she had purchased the new-build apartment in Hull in  for £, when the commercial property beneath it was an estate agents.But after that business moved out The Village Green Cafe Bar next door expanded its premises in  and moved into the empty space underneath Sophieaposs place, reports Hull Live. According to the baraposs planning application, the works were approved by Hull City Council two years after Sophie moved in following a local consultation. Sophie said that, since the baraposs move, the supermarket workersapos lives have been blighted by the incessant noise of a fan whirring underneath their bedroom, as well as other disruption from the bar. When we bought it I thought it would stay like that, she said. Then we knew Beercocks had moved out because it was just an empty shell, but then building work started one morning and we just thought, aposThis doesnapost look goodapos.  Sophie and Phil, who both work at Aldi, also applied for a mortgage redemption in October last year and have criticised the lacklustre efforts of the Governmentaposs Help To Buy scheme, which Sophie used to help buy the home with a £, loan, in helping to repay the money. Sophie said she is now in arrears with repayments for the scheme after the five-year interest-free threshold was passed in March. However, a recent valuation of the property showed it had dropped to £, in just over three years. We were really shocked, you donapost expect to lose £, in three years on a brand new apartment, she said. Weaposre just not getting anywhere and itaposs so stressful. And then we even had to move in with family temporarily because we couldnapost bear to be in the flat. Notices telling residents about the plans to expand the bar were put up nearby, but Sophie said she and Phil had not seen them and therefore did not raise the issue before it happened.  The baraposs planning application was approved in , according to council documents. Sophie said the problems had been particularly bad with the bar, which closes at pm each night, when she had to spend eight months off work with a prolapsed disc in her back in . Iaposve been through years of hell, she said. My medication put me into a severe depression, I was in a really bad way and this flat nearly finished me off. All I could do was sleep because of these meds and I couldnapost even do that. Now they are hoping to rent out the flat or even sell it to raise funds for a new place, but they are stuck because of the ongoing issues with the Help To Buy loan. They had even signed on for one of the homes in the Keepmoat Kingsfield Park development in Kingswood, but had to drop out. Weaposre just stuck - we canapost sell it because of the mortgage and we canapost rent it because of the Help To Buy loan, she said. We canapost live, we canapost sleep, we canapost enjoy ourselves.

According to Finding Freedom, the couple were dismayed when no picture of them and their son Archie was visible on the desk in the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen records her annual speech. In , Harry and Meghan appeared in a photo with William and Kate as the Queen read her Christmas message. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that Harry and Meghan felt they had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. According to palace sources quoted in the book, the Royal Family wanted to illustrate the line of succession. Harry and Meghan were not completely disregarded in the Christmas Day speech, however. Footage of the Queen and Prince Philip meeting Archie for the first time was included, with footage showing Harry, Meghan and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, watching on. I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great-grandchild, the Queen said at the time.  In the Queenaposs  Christmas Day speech, Her Majesty can be seen sitting in the Green Drawing Room of the palace beside a table with framed pictures. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall appear in a photo which marked the th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales. A lovely family portrait of William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis stands in the middle. Thereaposs also a photograph of King George VI from  as well as one of the Duke of Edinburgh from the Queenaposs private collection. But notably, Harry, Meghan and their son Archie are no where to be seen. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said at the time it was unlikely the Queen’s photo selections represented a deliberate snub to Harry and Meghan. But she said: “It does seem to represent the idea of a slimmed-down monarchy.” Ms Seward added: “All the media problems with Harry and Meghan must have worried her. However, she would never be so underhand as to deliberately omit their picture.” Prince Andrew, forced to quit royal duties over his aposcar crashapos Newsnight interview over his ­friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was also absent from the photos.As the Queenaposs Christmas Day speech was aired to millions across the world, Meghan and Harry were spending the Christmas break in Canada with their young son."},{"url":null,"title":"inside messiest home sale mounds","story":"NewsInside messiest home on sale with mounds of rubbish and cobwebs covering wallsA house dubbed Leeds messiest home on sale is due to go to auction in September with a guide price of just £, - but youll need to be willing to get your hands dirty to turn it aroundShareCommentsByMellissa DzinziLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUL NewsThe listing states the home has been neglected in recent years \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The two-bedroom property is due to go up for auction with a guide price of just £, and one look inside goes a long way towards explaining the price tag.Neglect from previous tenants has left the home in a poor state of condition with mounds of rubbish covering the carpet in most of the rooms, as reported by Leeds Live.It will be apossold as seenapos with all contents, fixtures and fittings included - meaning the buyer will be left with the responsibility of dealing with the mess.The outside of the home on Seaforth Avenue, Harehills, shows paint peeling away and fittings falling down, but itaposs not until you step inside that the scale of the renovation project required becomes clear. A living area shows the ceiling to have collapsed in above debris littering the floor below, with a wooden table, two chairs and a couple of run-down cabinets providing the only furniture. A second room is filled with rubbish including shopping bags, cardboard boxes and old plastic bottles, with a path through the litter allowing the only glimpse at the dark carpet which lies underneath. Pink paper has come away revealing black and white sections of the wall where ious patches of mould can be seen.

They said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. This book is based on the authorsapos own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting.However, many royal experts and fans have raised an eyebrow at this, saying itaposs very hard to believe that they had no involvement at all. The book includes extremely detailed accounts of events and insider information, all of which have been confirmed by two sources. However there is one line in particular that has got tongues wagging, as one of the source quotes is identical to one Meghan herself gave in her first interview about her royal romance back in . In the book, a source who is said to be very close to the couple says: He [Harry] knew Meghan was right for him. Their love was real, and their feelings for each other were genuine. Everything  was noise. In Meghanaposs Vanity Fair cover interview about Prince Harry, in which she discussed for the first time what it was like dating a royal, she said: The people who are close to me anchor me in knowing who I am. The rest is noise.Many royal experts believe the couple were part of the book, and say itaposs going to be uncomfortable reading for the royals.  Speaking on Lorraine, the Mirroraposs royal editor Russell Myers said: Itaposs a lot of mud slinging this book, and I donapost think it will be comfortable reading for anyone in royal family. Itaposs airing dirty laundry in public. I donapost understand why they would have thought it was a good idea. You go back to their team saying theyaposve had on corporation in this, but that is very hard to believe indeed. The bookaposs authors say every detail of the book has been confirmed by at least two sources. Russell adds: One may wonder who those two sources are, there are absolutely explosive details. They talk not only about the relationship, but the breakdown of the relationship with the entire family, the Queen, Charles and William. Itaposs all there to see. Itaposs absolutely extraordinary. A lot of the stories that they have been complaining about over the last couple of years have been proved correct. The courtiers calling her Duchess Dficult, thataposs confirmed, that she was having friction within the royal household.

However before Meghan found the ultimate fame by marrying a prince, she reportedly gave the press tip offs for stories and photo opportunities. An extraordinary new book on the coupleaposs lives, Finding Freedom, states: While Meghan, before she met Harry, had occasionally set up a paparazzi photo here and there or let info slip out to the press, she did everything in her power to protect the privacy of her relationship with the prince. She knew that keeping things quiet meant that they could get to know each other without pressure of further worries that came from reporters covering annd commenting on their burgeoning romance. In their new book, which has been serialised by the Times before its release next month, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand discuss the moment the couple discovered their secret relationship was about to be splashed on the front pages. They write: Harryaposs phone wouldnapost stop pinging with work from the Palace. Aides suggested it would best for Harry to cut his trip short and quietlyto London, his minimal security now something of an issue.  But the prince wasnapost having it. He wasnapost budging. They also claim that while concerned about the media attention that was about to land on her doorstep, Meghan was relieved. In keeping her relationship secret, Meghan had been forced to lie to many of her friends and family. When rumours started to fly, a photographer from Toronto messaged Meghan askingit was true, but she did not reply. Despite their efforts to keep things quiet, news of Meghan and Harryaposs relationship fascinated fans around the world.  However, the book also reports on the tensions their blossoming romance caused behind Palace walls. The Duke of Cambridge feared his brother had been blindsided by lust in his haste to wed Meghan, Finding Freedom claims, but Harry felt he was being snobbish. Durand and Scobie claim Harry was offended by Williamaposs advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl. According to the pair, William was happy for his brother, but just wanted to make sure that Harry wasnapost blindsided by lust.

Rachel Riley is one of the famous faces backing the awards, which will for the first time recognise the amazing work of iniduals from National Lottery-funded projects across the nation.  Rachel says: “Thanks to National Lot­­tery players, some £million has gone to support communities in the crisis. “But this year we want to honour the people within those projects who adapted so quickly and gave extra help. “It’s a real chance to say thank you. The winners in each category will win £, for their organisation and a National Lottery Award trophy.” Nominations are open- and the stories of some of the heroes already put forward showcase the commitment and sacrice so many people have been making during these troubled times.  Take actress and theatre director Moji Elufowoju, the founder of Sheffield-based Utopia Theatre Company. She has just been nominated for a National Lottery Award, thanks to the incredible Creative Hub initiative she has been running during lockdown. Now , Moji swapped a career as a paralegal to study drama in her forties before founding Utopia Theatre in . And as a British-born, Nigerian-raised performer, Moji says she had to battle discrimination in an industry where ethnic minorities have struggled for opportunities. She broke through after “continually banging my head against a brick wall and refusing to take no for an answer”. She is now determined to inspire a new generation of black artists.  “There’s a white middle-class club in British theatre and it can make the industry inaccessible to others – whether that’s performing, playwriting or simply being in the audience,” says Moji. “You can feel invisible, and I know a lot of black creatives with mental health issues as a result. “Utopia Theatre is all about giving erse people a voice. We showcase African culture and traditions, through classic plays and new material.” Last month, Utopia Theatre launched the Creative Hub, a free six-month programme of virtual workshops to combat the devastating effects of lockdown on the profession.

But the timing of his youngest sonaposs statement, in which Harry accused the media of racial undertones at the same time as confirming his new relationship, meant it dominated the news cycle. Royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand also claim Harry, , gave his dad just  minutes notice before releasing the statement in November . At the time, Charles was rounding off a delicate tour in the Persian Gulf sovereign state which he hoped would be covered signicantly. Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family: It was a critical moment that had been in the works for months. A statement from Kensington Palace condemning the Press and, in the same breath, confirming Harry’s new girlfriend would all but eliminate coverage of Prince Charles’s tour of the Gulf. Royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim: “The team at Clarence House, which had spent months putting together Prince Charles’ tour in the hopes that it would be covered signicantly, was crushed.” The book goes on to say Harry was lashing out at anyone who questioned his new relationship. “He would wonder, ‘Is this about race  Is it snobbery ’ the authors wrote.  Harry had allegedly cut ties with a friend for gossiping about Meghan and was poised for an outright war with the media. However, the book insists Charles understood that the situation with Meghan had reached a tipping point despite being disappointed by the timing of his sonaposs statement. Other extracts from the book - to be released August  - claim Harry felt brother William behaved like a snob as his new romance blossomed.  The authors says the protective older brother told the Duke of Sussex not to rush the relationship in a heart-to-heart nine months after he began dating US actress Meghan. He is said to have told his brother: Donapost feel you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl. Harry was reportedly left fuming by Williamaposs choice of words, and the pair hardly spoke for months afterwards.

Footage shows the revellers jeering, waving their arms around and failing to social distance inside the The Prince of Wales in Moseley, Birmingham, on Saturday night. The noisy customers, who were aposnot regularsapos, flocked to the venue as staff tried to close up for the night at .pm.A second clip, taken and shared on Snapchat, shows the moment they refused to stop singing in an incident which the pub said took  minutes to resolve, BirminghamLive reports.The video was captioned with a .pm timestamp. The pub has now banned drinkers under the age of  and anyone wearing trainers. The new admissions policy will start from next Friday, July  and the pub has apologised to its neighbours and other customers as it branded the group aposselfishapos. The strict crackdown will also see the introduction of bag searches at the door and the last admission brought forward to pm. Manager Keith Marsden has stressed that the pubaposs customers were not involved in a subsequent fight which took place in the street after closing time.He said: The new door policy that we announced today was not in response to a violent incident. There was no violence in the pub or indeed outside the pub last night. We always steward guests leaving the Prince to try and prevent such incidents. Our new door policy is not in response to the incident. Last night as we closed the pub, we had a group of customers, who are not regular customers, start singing. It took  minutes before we could get them to stop. At this late hour it was loud. We apologise to customers and neighbours. Any customer that does not respect the pub, our neighbours, fellow customers and our staff is not welcome. However the new rules have sparked criticism from regular customers who are either under the age of  or wear trainers as they will no longer be welcome inside the boozer due to the new door policy.  Amelia Iris said: Moved to Moseley as I loved the laid back atmosphere of it and how the pubs reflected that  Myself  and my  year old friend came for your reopening weekend enjoyed a few drinks and left and now weaposre not welcome because of our age  I think this is a risky move.

Rivets are normally found around the front and back pockets on jeans and theyaposre made by pressing or hammering a ‘washer’ or ‘disk’ onto a metal stud through the denim. The use of rivets on pockets dates back to  and their existence is all thanks to a tailor from Nevada named Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss  Co.Davis had been buying fabric from Levi Strauss to create clothing for miners and adding rivets to the pockets.He wrote a letter to Strauss explaining how the copper rivets helped to strengthen pockets when the miners were filling them with heavy tools. Strauss and Davis went on to form a partnership and received a patent for an improvement in fastening pocket openings. Rivets continue to feature on jeans all these years later, appearing in places where the most strain is put on the fabric to prevent seams from splitting. As well as this, there are a number of other common items in your home which have curious uses and features.Take for instance, a Heinz bottle of tomato ketchup.If you look closely at a glass bottle of the red sauce, youaposll notice the number  above the label, just below the neck.  While this number is often thought to represent the ious dferent products Heinz makes, it turns out, itaposs also strategically placed for an important reason. According to the company, the spot is the perfect place to tap on the bottle when youaposre struggling to get ketchup out. In the trivia section of their website, they explained: To release Heinz Tomato Ketchup from its glass bottle with extra speed, apply a firm tap to the spot marked aposapos on the neck label. And have you ever wondered why the letters on your laptop or computer keyboard arenapost in alphabetical order  Some of the first keyboards invented for typewriters had the keys positioned in alphabetical order, but it soon became apparent that the arrangement didnapost work very well as the typebars would clash.So the whole thing had to be re-arranged in order to make the machines work, taking into consideration the most common letter combinations and the frequency of use for each letter. The result was the QWERTY keyboard we use today, which was designed by Christopher Sholes. Going back a few years now to your school days, do you remember those double-coloured erasersyou had in your pencil case, where one end was red and the other was blue  That wasnapost just a fun design - each colour actually has a dferent use. Many believe the red is for erasing pencil marks and the blue side rubs out pen, but this wasnapost always the case. The red end is softer as itaposs actually meant for use on light paper, while the blue end is intended for coarser paper.

I#m just working off the idea that we#ll have to do what the beauty industry has done.#As soon as we get that green light I want to be able to reopen. I#ve got no income right now.#We#ve just been forgotten, it#s like we#re not being taken seriously.#The lack of clear instruction from the Scottish Government pushed Laura to join forces with over  other Scottish dance studios and send an open letter to Deputy First Minister John Swinney.The letter calls for clear guidance on reopening to allow firms to plan ahead and additional funding to be made available to the sectorit is to shut for a prolonged period.Other fitness businesses, such as gyms, also feel there is a lack of communication coming from Holyrood.Paul Keane, owner of Skyaxe Gym, claims  the industry has been given #zero guidance#.He said: #We thought we would get some guidance this week, but we haven#t heard anything.#I just have no understanding of how they can open a pub, but not a gym.#We can deal with sanitiser and social distancing, and record who comes in and out.#We could deal with it  times better than any pub or bar.#A spokesman for Leisure  Culture Dundee which manages LeisureActive gym memberships across the city including at Olympia said: #We realise the importance of physical activity in people’s lives and the desire of the public to get back participating.#The sector is striving to provide enjoyable, safe and meaningful provision with inclusive access. We look forward to being able fully support a healthy future for our communities and the general public when the time comes.#A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: #Exercise is good for physical and mental health and we know that many people have been missing going to the gym.#We don’t want these restrictions to be in place a minute longer than we judge to be necessary but, for now, indoor gyms must remain closed as they involve close prolonged social contact, which increases the chance of infection spreading.#We’d like to thank gym owners and their members for their patience at this challenging time.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

What do we want to be  What is our vision “We don’t have a branding strategy. We should be looking at ‘how can we generate £ million a year at the centre, as opposed to £m ’“If we’ve got the right strategy and philosophy in place – it might be community orientated – we’ll find more James Andersons.“And I may even be prepared with my foundationto do something centrallywe’ve got a real plan and a strategy.“To do that, we will need to put in a review, a proper, constructive review of Scottish football.“We should be thinking about how we generate more income.“The clubs are run by business people, they have commercial people looking at things.“The cup is half full, how can we drive things “But at the centre , it’s not run like a real company that would have a vision, a branding strategy or goals to drive income.“We have to come together as a league and decide goals, what do we want to be when we grow up “Football can be a magnet for people, healthy living and mental health, so we need to be at the centre of the community.“For too long we have taken the fans for granted.“I feel it’s my responsibility at Aberdeen to put a smile on people’s faces because I have been fortunate.“Too many people in high office think the fans exist to keep them there. We have to change that.”Cormack says clubs need to drive forward positive change when it comes to increasing revenues and improving Scottish football.The Pittodrie supremo believes club chairmen are willing to push things forward and added: “As a group of clubs, when we get together on our own, it’s really healthy and the conversation is good about how we go forward.“All the chairmen think we need to be a much more commercially-orientated organisation to drive revenues.“Rather than fighting over £m as it is now, the scraps that are there –we put another half a million in to drive commercial, will we cover it  Will we bring in £m  Or £m “There is a desire among the Premiership clubs to drive it forward from a commercial perspective and I find that healthy.“What we need to do now is take that through Peter Lawwell, Steve Brown and Les Gray as ourrepresentatives .“We have to hold them accountable to drive this agenda as we go forward.”Cormack believes football needs to be seen as a force for good and thinks moving away from sponsorship deals with alcohol and betting companies could show the game in a dferent light.Cormack said: “Other chairmen I know, know there are people out there who would be empathetic –not highly supportive – of our game.“If we had a vision and a branding strategy around healthy living, our communities and doing the right thing then, absolutely, I think we can bring more benefactors in.“The days of booze and betting sponsorships doesn’t really tie in with healthy living and being at the heart of our communities.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies,# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure that the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

May.Professor Sir Michael Marmot, the director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity, said that ldquobecause London was an early centre of the pandemic, it is likely that the increased risk among London bus drivers is associated with exposure.vw,vw,px, px\"A bus is deep cleaned He added: ldquoOur review explicitly suggests that lockdown was the main factor that saved bus driversrsquo lives.ldquoIf lockdown had occurred earlier, it would likely have saved more lives.ldquoFor those with high blood pressure, exposure to Covid- is particularly hazardous, disproportionately affecting drivers of ethnic minority backgrounds.ldquoIn addition to reducing exposure to the virus, all drivers should therefore be screened for health risk, with those most vulnerable to dying from the virus receiving the most benefit.Transport for Londoncommissioned the review after  of its bus drivers were reported to have died with Covid-.The study focused on the deaths of  of those drivers, as one had been on sick leave for other reasons before February , and another death occurred in June .Among those who died, most stopped work in the  days either side of the March  lockdown, which suggests they became infected before it was imposed.Death rates among drivers came down after the lockdown was imposed, which reinforces evidence that it was an effective measure in saving lives, the review

said the company has been ldquodevastated by the tragic deaths of our colleagues and it commissioned the study to try to find ways to cut the risk of others contracting coronavirus.She said: ldquoIt is clear from this piece of work and others that there are certain characteristics that make people more vulnerable to coronavirus.ldquoWe will work with our bus operators to ensure that they consistently carry out risk assessments and appropriate support is given to those that need it.ldquoWe know that those with underlying health conditions, such as hypertension and cardiovascular

to go into lockdown, underlying health conditions, ethnicity and where they lived.ldquoI am determined to do all I can to protect staff by putting into practice the recommendations made ndash building on the actions we have already taken to enhance cleaning, reduce interaction with passengers, and limit capacity.ldquoThis will include proper guidance for bus operators, risk assessments for staff

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its meeting on Tuesday.East Lothian Council received pound.million from Scottish Government funding for Spaces for People projects to make social distancing easier in town centres and encourage people toto them safely.The council launched a consultation in May, asking people for their county-wide views.It attracted , contributions and more than  comments, including more than  from the North Berwick area.But North Berwick residents have not been asked their specic views on Elcho Green car parking.The council said it had given consideration to parking availability at a number of sites in North Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of  places had been identied for use as a potential temporary car park which is not part of the Spaces for People grant but provided as part of the

People are getting fatigued and quite glad to be stepping down and do less.The community was split into nine clusters, with each assigned a lead volunteer.George told the Courier that the busiest cluster would receive about  calls a week when restrictions were at their peak.People would collect prescriptions and shopping, as well as take dogs for a walk.Hot meals were also delivered to those in need while volunteers worked with Dunbarrsquos foodbank.Electronic devices were also blanked and given a new lease of le with students in the town who were studying from home with schools closed.However, as restrictions have eased, George said the number of calls had ldquodropped right off.Volunteers have agreed to be on hand in case of a second spike and will be ready to ramp up their efforts should the need arise.Contact detailsTo contact the Dunbar resilience team, email Dunbar.covid@gmailGullane.

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Therefore, I thought this week I would take the opportunity to plug them and encourage you to visit us.To start in the west of the ward in Prestonpans exists the Prestonpans Murals Trail, which is made of over  pieces of art, and depicts the townrsquos culture and history.This includes murals on its witch hunts, industrial past, the influence on famous conservationist John Muirrsquos early le, and relation with migration both to and from Scotland ndash well worth a few hoursrsquo walk around the town.Also in the town there is the unappreciated Preston Tower, a structure with parts still standing from the th century. It is a one-of-a-kind building, with dferent parts and floors having been added over the years and other bits destroyed since it was first built.Currently it isnrsquot open but Prestonpans Community Council has been pushing to get it in a fit state so that the people of Prestonpans can truly benefit from this one-of-a-kind building.Moving east into Cockenzie and Port Seton, next to the harbour is the  Waggonway Museum. It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland. It was built in the late s by landowner Lord Seton so the community of priests could pray for his familyrsquos salvation.Finally on the coast there is Longniddry Bents, East Lothian largest tourist attraction. It is a beautul stretch of coastline home to a large iety of wildle, including many types of birds, voles and seals.Soyou are having a staycation this summer, visit the Preston, Seton and Gosford area and, whilst here, support our local cafes, shops, restaurants and pubs."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-it-act-vandalism","story":"Today we are faced with a proposal to turn part of one of these beautul natural sites, in a designated conservation area, into an unsightly car park.Having been born and brought up in North Berwick and able to take advantage of the foresight of our forefathers, I was astonished to find not only that the proposal had been lsquoapprovedrsquo, but that it had been made at all.

Im a good test subject given Ive never met a midge that doesnt like me.I still bear the scars ndash mental and physical ndash of a long weekend in Glen Coe a few years ago. It was July. There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow. Im considering putting up bat boxes after reading that a lone bat can eat , midges in one night.Citronella and Saltidinare among the ingredients that midges are said to find repugnant and give a wide berth. Essential oils such as eucalyptus, lavender and lemongrass have been credited with similar properties .The midge has a mighty reputation for such a miniscule insect. Weighing just one th of a gram, it has a teeny wingspan of -mm.

Think CK One.Verdict: Did a stellar job as I sat in my tree-covered garden on a still, humid evening.Visit smidgeupMary Jean Highland Midge Lotion , poundThe idea of making a midge lotion is one that Elizabeth and Mary Quinn struck upon by chance. The owners of family-run Mary Jean in Fochabers, Moray, were selling their skincare products at a Highland Games in .The midges were biting and in a moment of inspiration, Mary soaked some kitchen roll in lemongrass oil and hung it from their stall.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

He left behind parents Steve and Gee, sisters Donna, Stephanie, Angella and Dominique, and brother Daniel.Now,  years later, the BBC has made a one-off, -minute drama which imagines the le Walker could have lived.Written by Bafta winner Jimmy McGovern TV series such as Cracker and Broken, and the TV movie Hillsborough, Anthony is inspired by conversations with the teenagers devoted mother Gee.It is not only an incredibly moving and emotional story about loss but is also full of hope and love.The programme came about after Gee approached Liverpudlian McGovernand \"you just dont say no to Gee\", the writer lovingly quips.\"The BBC had just shown a really good film about the death of Damilola Taylor, and I knew thatI went to the BBC with a drama that showed a lead-up to the killing, the killing and the aftermath of the killing, about a young black boy, the BBC would say, Well, weve already done this with the Damilola Taylor story,\" continues McGovern, when we chat over Zoom .\"So, I had to find a fresh way in. Id been thinking about the First World War... the th hour of the th day of the th month, they kept on fighting right up until the th hour, even though everybody knew the war was over.\"Thousands died and I kept on thinking, How many of those men who died could have achieved something in their le  A cure for a virus, perhaps...\"And that got me thinking about Anthony. Thats the way it came about.\"Playing Anthony is Toheeb Jimoh, a rising British star who is set to have a leading role in Amazons highly anticipated sci-fi series The Power, and also appears in the Apple TV+ comedy, Ted Lasso, which is released in August.\"One thing I was painfully aware of was that, had I been born at a dferent time, and I had been at that bus stop in Liverpool, that could have been me - that could have been anyone,\" he suggests.\"As a young black boy myself, it was super-important to me and it was a subject super-close to my heart.\"He confides he was nervous to meet Gee for the first time at the read-through. But when he introduced himself, \"she just basically gave all of us her blessing to tell the story and she wished us the best and it was nothing but positivity and kind words\".He chuckles as he adds what she whispered to him later on that day.\"I was improvising, I was throwing stuff in that wasnt even in the script at some points, and she just pulled me aside and went, Anthony didnt swear!\"A particularly poignant part of the film depicts Anthony getting married, to a woman named Katherine, who is played by World On Fire star Julia Brown.Gee was on set for the wedding scenes, and Jimoh recalls the moment she walked in to see him suited and booted for the ceremony.\"She grabbed me, and she went, Wow. This is what my son would look likehe was getting married.\"It was huge for both of us and we had the longest hug in the world.\"Katherine is not based on a real-le person, which Brown - known for BBC series World On Fire - describes as \"liberating\".However, there were obviously many challenging moments on set.\"Especially, with the way that Jimmy did it, the couple of the scenes at the end, we show the alternate reality,\" she elaborates.\"So, sometimes, Toheeb and I would be laughing... like, we were filming when he walks me home after our first date, and we were having a great time, and then Terry our director said to us, OK, now Toheeb, go stand over there and Julia were going to film you walking alone.\"\"And then it hits you like a wave... That was quite dficult.\"The show is coming out at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the shocking death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May - which was caught on camera - protests against racism and police brutality have taken place across the UK.\"It feeds into the conversations that people are having at the moment about the bizarre nature of racism and Anthony really highlights for me how nobody wins,\" notes Welsh star Rakie Ayola, who portrays Gee, and is best known for her role in Holby City.\"Obviously Anthonys family dont win but the people who killed him dont gain anything. They dont gain so much as a pound coin from what they do.\"There was no reason at all to kill that young man. It wasnt to take his wallet, his phone, which is ridiculous enough. There is something so pointless about putting your energy into any kind of hatred in that way.\"So,youre of a mind to not quite understand why everyone is up in arms about this racism thing, well here you go.\"But it also means that we will take a lot of heat from people who are bored with the racism conversation right now.\"Does Jimoh think things have changed for him, as a young black man, in the  years since Anthonys death \"Of course things have changed and moved forward - but we still have a huge way to go,\" he says.\"Whats interesting now is that the climate has shted a little and everyone is reimagining their relationship with race.\"As a country, thats important and a huge step forward, but nowhere near enough has happened yet.\"Even though she describes her daughters as \"home-bodies\", Ayola confides she has been having more blunt conversations with them, about \"being careful, why other people need to be careful\", since the death of George Floyd.\"Thats been interesting as a parent, explaining whats gone on and trying not to terry them,\" she adds.\"Theres still a lot of work to do, as what happened to Anthony could still happen again tomorrow.\"Anthony airs on BBC One on Monday, .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"paperbacks-surfacing-strange-book-jacob-boyce-time-say-goodbye","story":"Kathleen JamieSort Of, pound.The poet and authorrsquos third prose book emerges from a period of mid-le reflection and is a meditation on time, both in terms of a le lived and on the scale of human existence.

Thus the certainty with which Ms Stephenson presents her ldquocase simply has no basis in reality beyond a convenient conjecture.Her musings about membership of the EU, likewise present another unwarranted certainty. It is certainly the case that member countries have their own currencies , but the fact is that the EU has never faced a situation like Scotlandrsquos and thus any certainty about what it might do is unwarranted. In any event, evenMs Stephenson is correct that the EU would refuse an independent Scotland membershipit lacked its own currency, she writes asone is in the EU or not, when the fact is that, routinely the EU enters into association agreements with applicant states prior to full membership. These, while not according voting rights, could give Scotland much of what we want from membership, such as single market access, participation in EU schemes and freedom of movement.Of course,one starts from the proposition that Scotland should continue to be part of the UK, then any forecast of an independent future will be extremely negative. Naturally, we are all entitled to our point of view, but presenting mere conjectures as facts is disingenuous. Ironically Ms Stephenson considers giving  impressions ldquoworse than irresponsible. She might want to look at her own contributions before being critical in this way of others.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.JILL Stephenson is correct, the British nationalist parties vetoed a currency union between Scotland and rUK, though it could only have worked short term in any case.After the break-up of Czechoslovakia, the establishment of new currencies was achieved quickly and pain-free. So Scotland should establish a new currency as quickly as possible, and as Scotland runs a substantial trade surplus we have a good basis from which to start. I prefer the ldquoNorway Option for Scotland, butwe did join the EU, the euro would be fine an optimal currency in a huge trade block on our doorstep.Would an independent Scotland have a per capita share of the substantial UK assets   If not we would then have no debt to repay . Butwe had Clark Crossrsquos trial run , we would spend our revenue for best Scottish bang-for-our-buck, not paying for expenditure outside Scotland ldquoon our behalf. We would not expect to pay any part of, or incur debt on behalf of, HS or renewing Trident, or the rebuilding of Westminster Palace, or any of the myriad of expenditures south of our border, any more than we would pay for spending programmes in, say, France.Of course, under Mr Crossrsquos suggestion, Scotland would have no way to access the many opportunities that a normal self-governing country has, but it would part the veil of dependency and let us see the most excellent vistarsquos that lie beyond. We only have to vote Yes.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I VERY much doubtClark Crosss proposal that Scotland should be given a two year \"trial run\" at independence would result in the waning of the desire for self-government as he confidently predicts. So far,  countries have gained independence from the UK, none of them has asked to come back and many of them celebrate the day that British colonial powers departed. As for Scotlands sustainability, other nations of similar size in population to Scotland are managing their independence very well, such as Denmark, Ireland, Norway, New Zealand, and Finland and there are plenty of other countries with far smaller populations than Scotland, such as Iceland, who are also thriving with self-respect, self-determination and self-government.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NICOLA Sturgeon often quips that Boris Johnsons a recruiting sergeant for Scottish independence. As a UK governmental committeehighlights \"credible\" evidence of Russian \"influence campaigns\" in the run-up to the  Scottish independence referendum, maybe shes confusing the Prime Minister with President Putin Martin Redfern, Melrose.SELFISHNESS OF THE ME SOCIETYI AM sure I was not the only one horried by the mess people left on the streets of Leeds when they celebrated theof their team to the top tier of English football.And just as many must have been appalled at the amount of litter left behind on a beach where many had gone to take advantage of the relaxation of lockdown.What we saw on our TV screens was shameful in relation to those two incidents.Those two sets of people, who were out to enjoy themselves, appear to have had neither common sense nor a conscience about the amount of clean-up which needed doing after their totally insouciant conduct.What could have been easier than to gather up their debris to deposit it in the available litter bins or to bring it home with them to dispose of it in their own refuse disposal bins at home Selfishness and a lack of consideration for others seem to be the characteristics we must expect from those who have no respect for their surroundings which they display in spades with their careless conduct.The me society is all too evident in those two episodes as though some people feel entitled to do what they like and devil take the hindmost.Freedom does not mean that we do not need to follow the rules and observe the proprieties of decency.I hope that those who made the mess felt thoroughly ashamed of what they had done when they saw the evidence of their disrespect scattered on the streets and the beach.Or is that too much to ask of those kinds of people Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ROCK OF SAGESPROFESSOR John Underhill raises important points about the perception of geology in Scotland . Knowledge of geology has never been more important, for understanding and mitigating future climate change and helping Scotland meet the  net-zero emissions target. So it is concerning that the number of applications for geoscience degrees at Scottish universities is in sharp decline.The loss of Higher Geology is undoubtedly a factor, but there are many opportunities within the Curriculum for Excellence and other Highers such as Environmental Science and Geography for pupils to learn how the planet works, and the many dferent ways in which geology and geological processes impact on modern le in Scotland. Organisations such as the Geobus at St Andrews University and Scotlandrsquos Geoparks are doing excellent work in taking geology into the classroom, and placing it in the context of sustainable development. The recent launch of a new charity, the Scottish Geology Trust, recognises the need to support these existing initiatives, and for wider promotion of the importance of geology to Scotland.Angus Miller, Secretary, Scottish Geology Trust, Edinburgh.VIDEO GAGAROBERT McNeils piece on video gaming was embarrassing : there have been holograms with more substance.First, video gaming being for \"loners\": right, so all those adverts with families playing Nintendo Switch games togetherjust passed him by, as did World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Rocket League and the umpteen other cooperation games where you have no chance of advancement or success without teamwork.Next, \"all the games had themes of violence and fighting\".

The picture is by no means as clear cut as Mr McKay attempts to present it. While he is obviously familiar with the titles of some of Dickensrsquos novels, he ought to read Martin Chuzzlewit, in which Dickensrsquos horror of slavery is abundantly clear. He should also read the chapter on slavery in American Notes, which shows Dickensrsquos utter revulsion at the manner in which slave owners treated their slaves.As to the assertion that ldquoDickens didnrsquot have much time for Catholics I would suggest that he read Pictures from Italy, where he will learn that Dickens took issue with aspects of ritual, but not with Catholics as people. He might try Barnaby Rudge, which, as he may know, is an account of the ldquoNo Popery Gordon riots of .

In the eighteenth century, the island was home to around fty distillers with each farm on the island operating at least one still producing whisky.This began to decline as tighter regulations from both the estate and the government were introduced. Although a large number of islanders were still making whisky illegally, this industry ceased completely in the nineteenth century.#Tiree Whisky Company Ltd was established by locals Alain Campbell and Ian Smith with the aim of reviving the spirit industry on an island with a rich heritage in the tradition.Local production of Tyree Gin began in February  and, once again, the island was home to an operational distillery - the first in  years.Hebridean Pink Gin is distilled with juniper, raspberries and sweet peels.

The makers of the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea have been slowly expanding their list of stockists across Scotland and the UK. saw them collect another swathe of awards including the Spirits Business Masters Medal for their packaging and design of their flagship product The Teasmith Original. They also released Broich Single Estate ndash a limited edition gin featuring tea grown right here in Scotland.Why tea  Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT. The founders used their recent time in lockdown to completely refresh their website and provide a nice range of cocktail suggestions too!

Westminster hasnrsquot balanced the books for years and the impending disaster caused by Brexit will only make things worse, we understand all of that. We also know that the devolved Scottish Government balances its budget and has no control over and is incapable of directly adding to the UK national debt. Any money Scotland gets from Westminster through the Barnett formula is not English largesse but simply some of our taxes being ed to where they were gathered.I reverse the question on our Unionist friends. What we Scots want to know is what England is going to do about the financial mismanagement of the UK economy, because the elected representatives we send to Westminster to reflect the views of the Scottish people simply cannot influence in any meaningful way what Westminster does. The facts are glaringly obvious that, despite years of austerity, England has failed to address fundamental flaws in our common economy and has compounded problems that have had and are having a detrimental effect on all the parts of our supposed union of equals. The distribution of wealth and its concentration in south-east England tells one all one needs to know about the role that Westminster plays and who controls it. HS encapsulates Westminster mentality.It may seem a risky gamble for Scotland to become independent, but then again to take to the leboats in the midst of a storm may also seem risky: but the only alternative is to cower onboard and drown with the sinking ship.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.AS the independence drum continues to beat ever louder and coronavirus acts as a possible catalyst or excuse for change around the world, I cant help but feel that the time is ripe to explore what might or should become of the land we now call Scotland.I cant speak for others but, for me, Scotland is ided both culturally and historically between Highland and Lowland, East Coast and West, not to mention the distinct nature of the people of the Northern Isles and the Scottish Borders. Dferent communities with dferent identities and dferent priorities. I do not see one homogenous nation.As a person with very deep roots in the Celtic West I feel far greater affinity with the people of Ireland than I do with many of the communities further east and south. This is not a conscious choice, rather a statement of personal orientation and belonging.The people of the Highlands and Islands have had an exceptionally poor deal from Edinburgh and its Lowland bastions in recent centuries. Infor backing the wrong horse in the , our precious Highland and Hebridean heartland has been decimated, its people and language oppressed, subjugated, burnt out and cleared. Are we supposed to say thank you As we move towards a second defining vote on our constitutional future I wonderI am alone in not wanting to be a pawn in a game that involves Edinburgh replacing Westminster only for Edinburgh then to cede power to Brussels  Why would you do that  Why work so hard and build so many expectations only to achieve so little If I am to vote for change then it has to mean something tangible and not simply switching one uncaring master for another. I will not be convinced that rejoining the EU is anything other than being party to a European Project that will ultimately lead to the creation of a new country called Europe. Whither Scotia then Can I perhaps dream of a new Atlantic nation from Argyll and the Clyde Islands to Caithness with a border on the Highland line  In control of its own destiny, freed from Lowland control yet living respectfully alongside one another We have great natural resources, pure water, clean air, abundant capacity for energy generation, magnetic scenery to draw the tourists, wide open spaces, world-leading foods and whisky and, above all, brilliant people with global reach. Who knows what we can achievewe can turn dust to seed, reap our own harvest and ring our own till Ill be honest and admit that I have no idea at this stage whether or not the people of the Highlands and Islands remotely share such a vision and how this could work economically but, in an age of iconoclasm and the redefinition of identity, no Lowland politician should assume that an independent Scotland would not, in turn, find itself broken up in time by those of us wishing to assert their fundamental right to self-determination.As the creation of Holyrood emboldened nationalism, so I hope that independence will, in turn, trigger an explosion in regional identity politics within Scotland itself. One step at a time.Fraser Kelly, Millport.THERE is a simple answer to Maggie Chettys questionwhy the Prime Minster wants to hang on to Scotland. It is because that is what the people of Scotland voted for in , in a fair and free democratic referendum. You would think she might remember that.Her letter also includes a fascinating reference to the UK benefiting from ious taxes, although of course the Scottish Governments own figures tell us that Scotland gets more out of the Union by way of revenues than it puts in. The tax mentioned by Ms Chetty that is most intriguing is the one on whisky, which looks an awful lot like the mythical whisky export tax so beloved of nationalist conspiracy theorists. Likewise, she has now added a fish tax and a beef tax.Which all begs a much better question than Ms Chettys:Scottish independence is such a great idea, why do its proponents have to tell so many lies to justy it Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.THERE seems to be growing concern that interpretation of the Hate Crime Bill presently going through Holyrood would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech , particularly as regards the aspect of \"stirring up hatred\" Could those of us who write to The Herald then run the risk of being accused of that crime by the overly sensitive taking offence at our use of language criticising them, their views or their actions and as a consequence stirring up hatred in their own breastnot where  The letterfrom David Stubley provides an interesting case study in what to me appears to be its deliberate use of language chosen in sum to be inflammatory and personally derogatory viz ldquolackeys\", \"toadying\", \"fallacious\", \"lie\", \"charlatan parties and their willing acolytes\", ldquo proven liar\" and \"used car salesman\".

However, a more emotion-centred focus is in evidence north of the Border.While warning against seeing the issue in binary terms, Ruth McKay, headteacher at Portobello High in Edinburgh, one of Scotlandrsquos biggest schools, is following an approach that she acknowledges will be viewed as ldquotowards the relationships end of the spectrum.Ms McKay said a personalised welcome for each pupil at the start of class ndash which could range from a simple hello to a namaste greeting ndash was among measures she hopes will boost emotional connections between teachers and children.ldquoSome of our young people will have been going through very challenging circumstances over the last few months, dealing with issues such as domestic abuse, substance abuse or financial hardship ndash our staff have been delivering food parcels throughout lockdown, she said.ldquoWe know others have felt overwhelmed or isolated. So wersquore anticipating a need for increased additional support for young people as weto school and our staff will be prepared for that.ldquoIf a young person is presenting in a distressed way ndash we wouldnrsquot talk about bad behaviour or challenging behaviour ndash the first question we as staff will ask ourselves is, what has been going on for that young person  And the next one is, how can we support them Ms McKay said a key focus in the coming weeks and months would be strengthening teacher-pupil bonds.ldquoOne of the things that we already ask all staff in the school to do is meet and greet young people when they arrive for lessons during the course of the school day, she said.ldquoRather than the class filing in and sitting down, chatting while they wait for the others to arrive, the teacher is on the door and will greet each young person as they enter. They might ask how that young person is doing, or say lsquoglad to see you backrsquo, or lsquoI loved your essayrsquo. Itrsquos a way of creating microinteractions, of giving teachers a split-second sense about how a pupil is doing.ldquoWhat we will be doing when weis continuing to find ways to create those little interactions. Of course, in the case of the personalised greeting at the start of class, it wonrsquot [because of Covid] be a handshake but it could be simply saying hello, or a namaste greeting ndash the teachers and young people will find ways of doing that.ldquo[In terms of space to address emotions], we run a range of groups and programmes and itrsquos a topic thatrsquos explored in Personal and Social Education, or assemblies, which might run virtually to start with, when wersquoll talk to young people about the emotions that they might be feeling as we re-engage after lockdown.Portobello Highrsquos approach has echoes where in Scotland, with St Bridersquos Primary in Cambuslang making emotional-regulation sessions available to all children, staff and parents.Plans have also been put together to ensure every secondary in Scotland has access to a mental heath counsellor.Writing for TES, developmental psychologist Suzanne Zeedyk describes such initiatives as practical examples of how schools could create ldquospace for talking about feelings and enable children to ldquobe in touch with, and to manage, their emotions.She contrasts this with the views of Tom Bennett, an adviser to the Department for Education at Westminster, who argues that clear expectations and policies on behaviour will be crucial as campuses reopen in the age of Covid.ldquoGood behaviour is the core mission for every school, whatever age or stage, he wrote in a recent online article.ldquoGet behaviour right and everything  is possible. Mr Bennett said students ldquomust be explicitly told the consequences for behaviour that threatens distancing measures, respiratory or tactile hygiene, are very serious indeed, and added that ldquomalicious, deliberate acts of transmissionshould be ldquotreated with the greatest seriousness.Amy Forrester, director of pastoral care in Cockermouth School in Cumbria, has a similar view.ldquoThere is talk of lsquorecovery curricularsquo, lsquoemotional wellbeing daysrsquo and lsquosignicant pastoral timersquo as part of the reopening provision, she wrote in an article for TES.ldquoWhile this is well-intentioned, I passionately believe that focusing on wellbeing interventions is, at best, misguided and, at worst, dangerous.

Currently, we predict a shortfall of income running into tens of millions of pounds.The fears of Glasgowrsquos leaders for its artistic and sporting heritage ndash including its Royal Concert Hall or Fruitmarket with their annual half a million visitors ndash come as it becomes increasingly clear the sectors are being devastated by the pandemic.Yesterday, The Herald on Sunday revealed some performing arts venues will be forced to raise ticket prices to cut the risk of Covid amid concerns there is ldquono such thing as a socially distant theatre.At the beginning of this month, Ms Hyslop announced poundm in targeted support for performance arts venues. The UK Government has pledged another poundm to help keep the arts in Scotland afloat.Sector insiders do not believe this money will be enough, as the scale of Glasgow Lersquos financial problems demonstrates.The charity receives about poundm a year from the council to deliver its core services. But it supplements this core funding with fees for everything from swimming pools and gyms and admissions to concerts and events. Its famous museums do not charge visitors but partly make up for this with money from gt shops, cafes and one-off special exhibitions.Glasgow Le is understood to have offset some of its fixed costs by furloughing hundreds of workers involved in this commercial operation. But it has to cover the full wage bills of its core workers.In their letter, Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald, who chairs Glasgow Le, stressed that Glasgow was far more economically dependent on its arts and sports sector than other parts of Scotland.Moreover, city spending on arts and sports delivers a dramatic multiplier effect.The city leaders wrote: ldquoSince , tourism to Glasgow has grown from . million to . million visitors. Spend has grown from pound million to pound million over the same period, helping sustain more than , jobs in the city.ldquoOne of the major draws for tourists to our city is our world-class civic collection and museums service.ldquoMore people visit Glasgowrsquos museums each year than in any other UK city outside of London, with visits reaching more than four million last year. Our museums service is perhaps the most efficient and effective in the country, delivering nice museums on a budget of pound million, with no national funding: compare that to the National Museums of Scotlandrsquos pound.m budget from Government and . million visitors annually.\"Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald also stressed the value of live music. Glasgow is behind Manchester and London for music tourism but its concerts still generate poundm from visitors to the city every year, they said.Earlier this month Glasgow Le published a schedule for re-opening its venues.

Which were halted by the Conservatives at short notice probably because invited scientic experts were increasingly at odds with UK government messaging. Johnson and his government are ducking scrutiny from journalists over the pandemic. Why are Labour happy with that George McDonald, heraldscotlandldquoShocking andirresponsible for Scottish Labour and Tories to demand an end to Sturgeons Covid briefings covered by BBC. They are surely aware of zero deaths in Scotland day after day to Englands still often well over   Communication is central to public health Kirsty Hughes, TwitterldquoYet it is Boris who intends holding daily political briefings on TV. The Speaker of the House of Commons is not at all happy about the pursuit of politics in this manner. Boris, on the other hand, is probably endangering broadcasting laws. He might have to give opposition parties equal broadcasting space.Mary Williams, heraldscotlandldquoThe question is \"are the briefings becoming Party Political Broadcasts \" and in my view they are. The F M is a politician to her core and any statement she makes is bound to be political. The fact that Scotland is reacting dferently shows that Devolution is working in the way it was planned. This does not prove that Independence is the right thing for Scotland. That is a quite separate debate and needs to be discussed accordingly. We should be wary of voting to leave the UK because we dont like English Tories, especially Boris. A credible opposition in both the UK and Scotland would add a lot to the quality of such a debateJames Hamilton, heraldscotlandldquoThe fact of the matter is the SNP have used this emergency as an excuse for early electioneering and have politicised the matter and it is also a good excuse to exercise to go Union bashing. Personally I dont know the full extent of the English organisation of the matter, but evenit was perfect you people would still disagree. Donald Peterson, heraldscotlandldquoIf you watch these briefings you will observe that the FM does everything she can to not politicise the briefings, she goes out of her way to avoid doing so. But, the people who do politicise them are the journalists who are asking the questions. that is where it comes from, and the FM does what she can to take that heat out of the issue.William Russell, heraldscotland: BBC urged to drop Sturgeons politicised Covid briefingsldquoLondons Labour Office in Scotland becoming increasingly hysterical as they accelerate down the political mineshaft to oblivion.Jim Chistian, heraldscotlandldquoMs Sturgeon is The First Minister of Scotland.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Recommendations for any additional health measures will be considered in stage two of the review.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network. A Gannett Company.

A new indictment is being introduced halfway into extradition proceedings, which have been a year in the making, he said.ldquoThe lsquonewrsquo superseding indictment actually contains nothing new.

It contains no new charges.ldquoWhatrsquos really happening here is that despite its decade-long head start, the prosecution is still unable to build a coherent and credible case.ldquoSo, theyrsquove scrapped their previous two indictments and gone for a third try.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app.Health officials are working hard to prevent a second deadly surge of the virus, which has claimed more than  lives since it first arrived here. However, concerns have been raised about a lack of information over the location and extent of emerging clusters, particularly as shielding is due to be paused on Friday.Health officials have provided some information to the public about clusters, but have so far only confirmed the location of the cluster arising from the karaoke party.The PHA revealed that since the start of the Limavady cluster  cases have been added to the contact tracing database, while  contacts had been identied.Read More Limavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionThe PHA declined to provide any further information, stating that it may result in people being identied. This is despite growing calls for clarity over the location of clusters to enable the public, particularly those most at risk from the virus, to take additional measures to protect themselves when it is active in their community.Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of the Stormont health committee, said: I recognise the challenge for the PHA in ensuring that patient confidentiality is assured as part of the contact tracing process and we now have good evidence that contact tracing is fundamentally working in identying and following up clusters.Nevertheless, in a public health emergency we must also have public information so that the public can make decisions about how to go about their daily lives safely.I would still wish to see more information about the locality of clusters immediately when they are identied, and about the nature of clusters in due course, so we can identy clearly what specic activities are leading to #superspreading#.Shielding is pausing on Friday for the , people who were warned their lives are at riskthey become ill with Covid-.They have received limited advice about what is safe from Friday, which includes a recommendation that they should continue to work from home where possible. At the same time it has emerged that  clusters have been identied here since May , with more expected in the coming months.

It has also opposed the extradition from the Republic to Lithuania of Liam Campbell, found liable in a civil court for the  Omagh bomb.The IFP, which was established in  and supports controlled immigration, describes its primary objective as re-establishing the national independence and sovereignty of Ireland and restoring its national democracy by leaving the European Union.It was contacted for a comment but had not responded by the time of going to press.Police are investigating the incident.

While many under his post commented with laughing emojis others asked why he thought he should mock the language.Sinn Fein MLA Emma Sheerin said Mr Campbell was attempting to mock the Irish language and identity with the post.“Comments posted on social media by DUP MP Gregory Campbell attempting to mock the Irish language and identity are crass, offensive and despicable, The Mid Ulster MLA said“Sadly, this is not the first time Gregory Campbell has insulted the Irish language community with his offensive anti-Irish mockery, these comments are reminiscent of .“When the Assembly was restored in January, DUP leader Arlene Foster said identities should be respected. Perhaps Gregory Campbell needs to reflect on the words of his party leader.“It is long past the time that disrespect like this is allowed to go unchallenged and time the DUP genuinely embraced equality and respect.”The DUP has been approached for comment. SDLP MLA Cara Hunter called for Mr Campbell to apologise for the comments. “This is not the first time that Gregory Campbell MP has made crass and offensive comments of this nature, which are intended to insult the Irish language community, the East Londonderry MLA said. It is not the first time and likely not the last time. However, as unsurprising as these comments are, it is important that they are challenged.”“Gregory Campbell should remember that he was recently re-elected to serve the whole community, right across East Derry.

It was constructed in  and designed by the most prolic architect of the time, Thomas Jackson.The detached four bay, two storey neo-classical home occupies a fabulous position in the heart of Belmont, is convenient to many schools, Parliament Buildings at Stormont and  minutes from the City Airport.The property, which has been vacant for quite some time, is a blank canvas where the buyer will have full control of the finished product for the asking price of £.m.Estate Agents Templeton Robinson and Simon Brien Residential are joint agents on the property. Michael Young, partner in selling agent Templeton Robinson#s North Down office, said: The template for Hampton House really allows the buyer to decide on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and reception rooms but there are potentially five bedrooms and three reception rooms.Farran#s Construction, which is selling the house, is offering a choice of kitchen, bathrooms and finishes to the house included in the selling price along with a garage.The buyer has the opportunity to decide which kitchen, bathroom etc they want and it will be fitted but the seller will also be able to upgrade the kitchen or bathroomthey want and pay the additional costs.Included in the price is a choice of tiled flooring to hall, kitchen, utility, toilets, bathroom and ensuites and choice of carpets to lounge, dining, study, family room, bedrooms, stairs and landing.

Mr O#Toole said that despite the UK Government#s claims to have prioritised Stormont consent, Mr Gove and his fellow Tories have not even acknowledged the Assembly#s motion calling for a Brexit transition extension.A simultaneous letter sent to the local First Ministers laments the lack of any public advocacy from the leaders of devolved Government on behalf of Northern Ireland#s interests in relation to Brexit. The MLA said there had not been a single update to the Assembly on Brexit preparations despite the huge risk presented to Northern Ireland and the rapidly shortening closing timeframe. The Assembly is due to go into recess later this week. Mr O#Toole said: I have written to both Michael Gove and the First Ministers in growing despair at the total absence of either information or transparency on what is happening in relation to Brexit and the implementation of the Protocol. Gove has waxed on about his desire to serve Northern Ireland#s interests, but has treated our people and our industry with little more than contempt. I have set out a series of basic questions to answer.In truth we have come to expect little more from ideological Brexiters in Government. But people here were entitled to think that theof an Executive and Assembly would at least mean more of an opportunity for real local accountability and action to protect our interests.Separately, Ireland#s Justice minister Helen McEntee has said paramilitary violence could reignite in Northern Irelandthe UK and EU fail to agree a new toolbox for cross-border police co-operation before the Brexit transition period ends.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseIrish Justice minister Helen McEntee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIrish Justice minister Helen McEnteeThe threat of a resurgence in paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland is very real and the ability to counter that threat could be seriously undermined with the loss of the toolbox provided for by EU instruments, she told the Sunday Times.Belfast Related ContentGalleryBrexitTony Blair calls for probe into Moscow interference in Brexit referendumTony Blair has called on the Government to investigate alleged Russian interference in the Brexit referendum after the publication of the long-delayed report into the Kremlin#s involvement in domestic British politics.Nelson McCausland PremiumNelson McCauslandOpinionWhy the DUP must stand up for the Union to counter these initiatives for a united IrelandSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has announced plans to establish a New Ireland Commission to develop ‘a path towards a united, just and reconciled new Ireland’.  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk efac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-bedf-a-bfd-dccbcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk efac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-bedf-a-bfd-dccbcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk efac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-bedf-a-bfd-dccbcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk efac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-bedf-a-bfd-dccbcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk efac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-bedf-a-bfd-dccbcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKWhat are the main sticking points between the EU and UK negotiating teams The UK’s chief EU negotiator David Frost and his EU opposite number Michel Barnier have given their verdicts to the media at the end of a round of “intensied talks” in London.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e---acd-dcbedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e---acd-dcbedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e---acd-dcbedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e---acd-dcbedc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_e---acd-dcbedc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKUK and EU negotiators send mixed messages over trade deal prospectsThe Brussels and UK chief negotiators have aired mixed messages over the likelihood of a post-Brexit trade deal following the conclusion of their latest London-round of talks.Most ReadBelfast cafe owner Whearty angers her former staff over alleged unpaid wagesFormula  legend Eddie Irvine partied with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York and MiamiCoronavirus:  test positive for Covid following karaoke party held at Limavady houseUVF plays down rt over terror gang exhibition in BelfastThe Earl and Countess of Erne on their magical wedding and le at Crom Castle,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Coleraine fans are the same.People were going to organise a Zoom thing to watch it but I said: #No, I#m sitting in the house on my own with no distractions#. And I told my we and our wee girl to go to her mother#s for the night.My phone will be off to watch the game and it#s going to be so surreal not being there. I have never missed a big occasion never, ever, but it#s one of those things.Coleraine superfan Dougie Wilsonhas been attending The Showgrounds for  years and follows Oran Kearney#s side with his family home and away.Despite the disappointment of not being able to head to Windsor Park, Dougie along with his we, two daughters and grandson are joining their fellow Bannsiders at The Showgrounds to watch the game on a big screen.They have described it as a big screen, but how big a screen it is I don#t know, said Dougie, who only ever misses a Coleraine match when he is on holiday.The social club will be open and a few fans will be going for a bit of a day out. Ballymena really take the biscuit with us, but this is what we have been missing for four months now.My grandson is in the  academy at Coleraine and he#s only started training again this week after four months. He was a ball boy at the League Cup final behind the goals, so he had a great time there.Dougie also takes his grandson Jack to football training at the Ulster University in Coleraine and he said the first team players know all their youth players by first name.That#s the sort of club it is, they love us and we love them, he added. We#re just one big family and one big community.Elsewhere, Glentoran supporter Girvan Wiltshire , who has been a member of the Glens# Stormont supporters# club for  years, never misses a game unless he is away enjoying the sun.In fact Girvan only missed three Glens games this season as he was on holiday, but he understands why the semi-final against Cltonville is being played behind closed doors.Of course, with the two matches at the one time it would have been a bit more awkward as well, he said.We#re all in this together but I would be feeling a lot worse about missing itI was ill orit was because I was working or something.With it being live on television it definitely softens the blow instead of trying to keep up to date on social media, especially since the last match was in March.A couple of the boys from the supporters# club will be coming round and we#ll be keeping the numbers down under the current circumstances.We#ll have a couple of beers and maybe a pizza at half-time.Cltonville season ticket holder Pedro Donald, who owns The Sunflower in Belfast city centre and The American Bar in the docks, is planning to meet a few friends and rival Glentoran supporters to watch the game.The first Cltonville game Pedro witnessed was the  Irish Cup final when the Reds beat Portadown - - the last time the north Belfast club lted the trophy.Obviously, we would love to go to the match but with everything going on we can#t, said Pedro. At least it#s on TV and the ones I would regularly go on a Saturday with are all meeting up to watch it, socially-distanced.We#re actually meeting up with some Glentoran fans, so it should be good craicnothing .My first ever football match was the  cup final and we haven#t won the thing since. I thought it was brilliant, and here we are  years later and we haven#t won it since then.Meanwhile, fellow Cltonville season ticket holder Henry McDonald hopes thathis side beat Glentoran today, those who regularly put in a sht at Solitude will be given priority when the small amount of cup final tickets are handed out.The tickets should be given to the people who do the voluntary work at Solitude - the guys who pick up the litter, the guys who do the security, the guys who sell the programmes and work in the club shop, he said.

he may not have been aware of the extent of his “violence and terrying behaviour”, the High Court has heard.Lawyers for The Sun newspaper said there is a “wealth of evidence” to support Ms Heard’s allegations of domestic violence by Mr Depp, which paints a picture of the actor as “a hopeless addict who repeatedly lost his self-control and all ability to restrain his anger”.Mr Depp, , is suing the tabloid’s publisher, News Group Newspapersand its executive editor, Dan Wootton, over a  article which labelled him a “we beater”.The Pirates Of The Caribbean actor denies the allegations of violence made against him by Ms Heard, .On Monday, the case – the biggest English libel trial of the st century – entered its closing stages as NGN’s legal team began making closing submissions.Sasha Wass QC, for NGN, told Mr Justice Nicol that evidence of Mr Depp’s “drug and alcohol-fuelled lestyle provides a backdrop to the events in question”.She said: “Firstly, it demonstrates that the claimant was subject to irrational mood swings and abnormal behavioural patterns, which would not have been present when Mr Depp was clean and sober, and Mr Depp has a name for this metamorphosed entity, namely ‘The Monster’.“The other aspect which is important in terms of substance abuse is Mr Depp’s recollection of his own disgraceful conduct, which is so severely impaired by drug misuse that he may not even have been aware of the extent of his violence and terrying behaviour which, on more than one of these pleaded incidents, put Ms Heard in fear of her

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappActress Amber Heard arrives at the High Court Ms Wass also told the court: “The days are long past when the courts in this country required corroboration before accepting the unsupported testimony of a female complainant.”She later said it is “trite” to suggest that a person who chooses to remain with a violent partner “cannot be a victim”.She said: “We submit… that the testimony of a complainant of domestic violence is sufficient to prove the case, provided that the complainant – Ms Heard in this case – gives credible and reliable evidence.”However, she said that in this case, unusually, there is also a “wealth of evidence” to support Ms Heard’s account.She said there were text messages and emails to support her evidence, as well as medical evidence from those who were treating Mr Depp for his addictions.Ms Wass said: “This paints a picture of a hopeless addict who repeatedly lost his self control and all ability to restrain his anger.”At the outset of Monday’s hearing, Ms Wass said that the defence to the article complained about by Mr Depp is “one of truth, namely that Mr Depp did indeed beat his we”.She said: “For the defence of truth to be substantiated, the defendants need to prove on a balance of probabilities that Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on at least one occasion.“During the last two weeks, the defendants have established that many more than one incident of we-beating took place over the course of the relationship between the claimantand Amber Heard.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ae .ece AUTOCROP w

Depp’s claim – all of which the actor denies – as well as his past relationships with women including Vanessa Paradis, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss, and his well-documented use of drink and drugs.He accused Ms Heard of “building a dossier very early on” in their relationship to align herself with the #MeToo movement.And he told the court no other woman had ever accused him of hitting them.In her evidence, Ms Heard claimed her ex-husband threatened to kill her “many times, especially later in our relationship”, and would blame his actions on a “self-created third party” he called “The Monster” – who she said she was “terried of”.In a witness statement, Ms Heard accused Mr Depp of verbal and physical abuse, including screaming, swearing, punching, slapping, kicking, headbutting and choking her, as well as “extremely controlling and intimidating behaviour”.She also said Mr Depp was “extremely jealous” and accused her of having affairs with stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, whom he

P pupil Grace Bradley clinched a ‘fun day’ prize for her class by recording the highest number of points over five weeks, while P pupil Aoibhinn Mullan took home the voucher. googletag.cmd.push The school’s Sports Day co-ordinator, Sheena McKeown, was delighted with the effort made by all the children. “It was such a good achievement, given the fact that we aren’t in school and we’re not together, we still did so well,” she told the County Derry Post. “It didn’t just revolve around the Sports Day, children could get points for wellbeing and staying off their electronic devices.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He will not be able to call on Shane Lagan after the long-serving defenders retirement. Also gone is Conor McGurk who is still in Australia following the coronavirus pandemic. One man who is back in the fold is Paddy Henry, who has played just one game since the clubs  intermediate championship win. Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

It was point for point and the sides were level at the break, - each. Ciaran Hendry, Paddy Henry and Ryan McGill pushed Lavey three points clear and on their way to victory. It was a good workout, Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey said after the game. googletag.cmd.push It was awkward and it was a tough breeze to play in. Theywere fairly physical and we were happy enough to get a win. The Lavey boss referenced his sides lack of composure in front of goal, allowing Na Magha to stay in the game. I would safely say we had  wides and we gave away a lot of frees and eight of their  scores came from frees, McGarvey added. That makes it dficult, giving away frees for hands on back and wee flicks on men...things that you shouldnt be doing and then we were missing our own frees. That was letting them back into the game. googletag.cmd.push Apart from Ryan McGill having space when he hit the games first point, neither side created an out and out goal chance. I thought Na Magha were very good and they defended very well, the Lavey boss concluded. It is about getting two points and there will be teams sitting on zero points this week.

The Erins Own side went into an early lead with points from Ryan McGill, Fintan Bradley and Liam Murphy. Deaglan Foley kept the city men in touch and when they got back into the game. It was point for point and the sides were level at the break, - each. Ciaran Hendry, Paddy Henry and Ryan McGill pushed Lavey three points clear and on their way to victory. It was a good workout, Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey said after the game. googletag.cmd.push It was awkward and it was a tough breeze to play in. Theywere fairly physical and we were happy enough to get a win. The Lavey boss referenced his sides lack of composure in front of goal, allowing Na Magha to stay in the game. I would safely say we had  wides and we gave away a lot of frees and eight of their  scores came from frees, McGarvey added. That makes it dficult, giving away frees for hands on back and wee flicks on men...things that you shouldnt be doing and then we were missing our own frees. That was letting them back into the game. googletag.cmd.push Apart from Ryan McGill having space when he hit the games first point, neither side created an out and out goal chance. I thought Na Magha were very good and they defended very well, the Lavey boss concluded. It is about getting two points and there will be teams sitting on zero points this week. The first game is about winning, we will know all about it with Slaughtneil next. Report and photos in Mondays Derry News and Tuesdays County Derry Post. RELATED- Slaughtneil ease past Screen.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along. Recently, it seems to be turning out to more of a community effort to be honest, he said.ldquoAt the beginning of lockdown I missed all my friends, but the farm helped keep me busy.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be a great lover of completing schoolwork at home. I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

Kelly Smith was very pleased with . as a new personal best time at that distance.Not to be outdone, Suzy Smith also marked a new PB with . which should really boost her confidence. It seems no time since she was working to break the -minute barrier so real progress has been made by both these runners.In the K there was an ldquoelite race which was the focus for many top athletes as they tested their legs on the flat course and against each other.The race was won by Olympic marathon hopeful and former Jimmyrsquos Ten winner Stephen Scullion in ., to really set a very high standard. His time was over half a minute faster than he ran in the European Championships in Berlin two years ago.Aaron McGrady was th in . mdash not a PB by any means but a solid performance in this time of limbo.Jimmy Sloan has been raring to go since Jimmyrsquos  was called off and he showed himself race fit with a . finish for th place, which was some two minutes  seconds faster than his previous personal best. He was over the moon with this result.The womenrsquos race was won by Ann-Marie McGlynn in a new NI record time of ., with Jessica Craig nd in . and Gemma McDonald third in ..East Downrsquos Hannah Somani, only just missed on a podium place but broke  minutes in . with relative comfort. This was a particularly laudable effort and particularly pleasing for her given that she has only just ed from an injury which prevented her from training for more than two months.ConnemaraCheryl Denvir and Lisa Milligan also deserve a shout out for their weekend exploits. They were in Connemara for the Gaelforce Adventure Race which according to the race brief is a ldquostunning route involving cycling and running through the Inagh Valley, Glen Valley, Maamturk   Ben Mountain ranges, Western Way Trail and kayaking on the crystal clear waters of the Killary Fjord in the shadow of Connaughtrsquos highest mountain Mweelrea. This is Connemara from the inside out. This route with its ied terrain and dramatic views will keep you interested and get you over the line before you know it.I am not sure that they would agree with it being over before they realised mdash the run alone was a mud bath and the cycle was testing to say the least. However both athletes did themselves proud finishing well up the rankings on a tough day out.Over  entered the event and there were a fair number of DNFs. Cheryl finished in th position with a total time of two hours and  minutes. Lisa was home within the three-hour barrier and in the top half of the field, coming th.Even better, she was a clear winner in the F category with her nearest competition more than half an hour behind her Well done you two.The half marathon race was won by the redoubtable Tommy Hughes, aka the lsquoMarrakesh Expressrsquo, in a time of ., which would be a mark most would give their eye teeth to achieve.Given that Tommy is now in the over  age category, it is nothing short of incredible. Well done to him..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Spa Wells group delivers 60 good parcels to residents  ","story":"MEMBERS and volunteers of Spa Wells Cultural Association distributed  food parcels in the area recently.The parcels were delivered to elderly residents and those shielding due to coronavirus.While the lockdown restrictions continue to ease, the association says it is aware that things are still far from normal.A spokesman said distributing food parcels was one small way to help neighbours, relieve social isolation and improve the quality of le of the local community.Residents were grateful to receive non-perishable items and vacuum-packed fresh meat from Poole Butchers.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11620664.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had it sprung on us.Mr Fitzgerald said there were concerns that the new charges would postpone the trial until after the US election in November, adding that President Donald Trump had referred to Assangersquos defence as ldquoa plot by the Democrats.ldquoWe are concerned about a fresh request at this stage with the potential consequences to derail the proceedings and that the US attorney generaldoing this for political reason, he said.Assange attended the short hearing via video link from Belmarsh, having previously been absent due to medical reasons.Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said that the new indictment was ldquowasting the courtrsquos time.ldquoWhat the US is doing is truly unprecedented. A new indictment is being introduced halfway into extradition proceedings, which have been a year in the making, he said.ldquoThe lsquonewrsquo superseding indictment actually contains nothing new. All the alleged events have been known to the prosecution for years. It contains no new charges.ldquoWhatrsquos really happening here is that despite its decade-long head start, the prosecution is still unable to build a coherent and credible case.ldquoSo, theyrsquove scrapped their previous two indictments and gone for a third try. They are wasting the courtrsquos time and flagrantly disregarding proper process.It comes as Spainrsquos National Court was due to hear evidence in an investigation into whether Assange was spied on during the seven years he lived in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.It is alleged that David Morales and his Undercover Global SL security agency invaded the privacy of Assange and his visitors at the embassy by secretly recording their meetings..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  ukept in dark u over new indictment article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
