Breaking traditions never felt so good on your conscience – and the environmentThe stereotypical Christmas morning involves frosty white snow, warm families and children getting up at the crack of dawn to rip open stockings full of glittering wrapping paper, sugary treats and plastic toys that will probably be discarded by lunchtime.But as we seek to reimagine a more environmentally friendly Christmas, what might we do when dawn breaks on the 25th to ensure we generate less junk and more joy?Play swap. Ilana Taub, co-founder of environmental consultancy Bolder and the Snact fruit snacks with compostable packaging, suggests a swap session with family and friends. “We all own so many things we don’t use, so how about a Secret Santa with meaningful or useful things we own,” she suggests. “It will hopefully get people thinking about whether they need all the stuff they already have.” Pre-loved Christmas gifts from your local charity shop are ideal things to swap – with the added benefit of having raised a bit of money for good causes.Sing in the season. Carols are a staple part of Christmas when you’re at school, but many of us fall out of practice as we get older. This is as shame as, even if you can’t carry a tune, the melodies and harmonies for classics such as Silent Night and Once in Royal David’s City are relatively easy to pick up again. Rehearse enough ahead of Christmas and you can – with the help of a keyboard, guitar, recorder or even a piano app – be serenading your family in four-part harmony. Failing that, consider a singalong to the pop classics, such as Little Drummer Boy, Mary’s Boy Child and White Christmas, with the help of YouTube. Singing together as a family is a good way of bonding – and making everyone feel less self-conscious about their vocal abilities.Prepare some poems. Take a leaf from the Dutch tradition of celebrating Saint Nicholas by writing other members of the family a fun, poetic tribute. Gently tease them for their foibles, praise them in word play for recent achievements, and read the poems aloud on Christmas morning to give everyone some light relief. OK, this is easier in Dutch, which has fewer words, and a lot of rhyming endings, but there are plenty of seasonal favourites to take inspiration from, such as AA Milne’s King John’s Christmas.Take a brisk walk. Instead of trying to walk after lunch – when, let’s be honest, you probably won’t get far – use the morning to enjoy the lack of crowds and cars on the road. Wrap up warm, don your home-knitted beanie and take some time in the outdoors – preferably up a picturesque snow-covered hill, with dogs, children andor grandparents.Push the red envelope. One way of reducing wastefulness when gifting is to take inspiration from the Chinese new year tradition of giving children money in a red envelope so that they can save up and buy something they really want. Economists point out that this makes for much more efficient resource allocation than traditional festive-gifting. Giving cash rather than badly-judged gifts can also encourage kids to work out the cost of their presents and help them appreciate the value of money.Decorate the tree. Instead of opening brand new gifts under the tree, why not save Christmas morning as a festive time to decorate your tree? There are two options when it comes to the tree itself: one is plastic, as long as it’s going to last at least a few decades. Government waste reduction body Wrap states that “artificial trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have a lesser impact than natural alternatives”. Alternatively, a real tree that can be put in your garden, either in its pot or planted into the soil, can give you joy all year round – and even make an appearance next Christmas. You could even use Christmas morning to bake the ultimate environmentally friendly decorations: tree biscuits. They just go soft if you make them in advance, anyway.Give the gift of your time. What could be more in the spirit of Christmas than to volunteer? Charities and good causes offer Christmas meals for those without family to go to – and many of these people welcome help getting there. You could do a shift at a shelter, help cook or prepare for a Christmas party, or even hold your own community event. (Of course, this kind of giving doesn’t just apply on Christmas morning – charity shops are often desperate for extra pairs of hands in the run-up to the big day!)Wrapping it all up. If you do decide to exchange gifts (after ensuring they’re environmentally friendly and ethically sourced), bear in mind that glittery wrapping paper and plastic bows can’t be recycled. Studies show that each British household uses four rolls of paper wrap for stocking presents and gifts, and Wrap reckons the amount of wrapping paper thrown away at Christmas in the UK alone would stretch to the moon. Dr Aiduan Borrion, associate professor of University College London’s Circular Economy Lab, recommends choosing packaging with care. “A lot of wrapping paper has plastics or glitter on it, and isn’t suitable for recycling,” she says. “Look at an alternative way of wrapping presents using recyclable papers or box baskets, which you can then use for different occasions. Newspaper is also a very common way of wrapping gifts, and you can also look at using reusable fabric.”Plenty of stores and charity shops sell eco-aware paper nowadays, and Oxfam’s high street shops sell a range of recycled and craft-based options that are responsibly sourced.

We take a closer look at his workFelipe Dana’s work in 2019 has taken him all over the world, covering big news stories like the elections in Spain, conflict in Syria, the crisis in Hong Kong, and to Rwanda, Greenland and Algeria to focus on environmental stories. He has regularly featured in our 20 Photos of the Week series and in our daily highlights photography galleries.We asked Dana about his year as a news photographer, his favourite assignments and images.“2019 was a busy and difficult year in many parts of the world, with political turmoil and massive protests in nearly every continent, never-ending conflicts in the Middle East, the plight of migrants and the climate crisis. With all this happening across the globe, it was an intense year to be a news photographer but that’s also when our job becomes most important.”“I covered a great variety of stories in 2019, starting with the ultra-right in Ukraine. I then went to Syria to cover war in the last territory held by Islamic State.”In February the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured Isis’s final stronghold. Hundreds of people were evacuated from Baghuz in eastern Syria.“It’s very hard for me to pick one favourite, single image, but one that strikes me was taken in Syria when I was following the mass evacuations out of the last territory still held by Islamic State militants. There was a screening area in the middle of the desert and that night men, women and children were gathering there, all sitting on the ground. I spotted this woman holding her baby after she was screened by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, it was extremely dark but there was just enough light from a nearby military vehicle. The lighting reflected the dramatic moment she was in.”A year and a half after Isis was declared defeated in Iraq, a battle continues between surviving members of the group waging an insurgency and the security forces who are relying on intelligence operations, raids and searches for sleeper cells to stamp them out.Dana went to Madrid in June to cover the all-English Champions League final won by Liverpool.“Although I work mostly shooting features and news stories, a big part of the life of an agency photographer is to shoot sports, so often I’ll help in events like the Champions, World Cup and Olympics.”Felipe visited Albania in June for a feature on the Vjosa River. Rivers are a crucial part of the global water cycle. They act like nature’s arteries, carrying energy and nutrients across vast landscapes, providing water for drinking, food production and industry.“I spent a few weeks traveling in Albania, documenting one of Europe’s last wild rivers, the Vjosa, where the government has set in motion plans to dam the river and its tributaries to generate electricity for one of Europe’s poorest countries and many locals are fighting that project. I was surprised to learn how few large rivers still run free and how much a dam can impact the local ecosystem.”Dana travelled to Greenland in August and followed a NYU team of scientists who are tracking the climate emergency in Greenland. “After Albania, I went to Greenland where I followed the work of scientists who are trying to understand the alarmingly rapid melting of the ice. I only had a few days there but the country is so beautiful I decided to make use of the very long days and photograph throughout the night in a unique and bright evening light. It only gets dark for a few hours at that time of the year. The size of the icebergs is really humbling. As amazing as some of them may look in the pictures, I still felt like the photos didn’t do them justice.”“I went to Rwanda to the Volcanoes national park where the world’s longest-running gorilla study takes place. It is a beautiful country. I felt extremely lucky to see the stunning mountain gorillas in person. After reaching the park’s entrance in 4x4 cars, we followed local guides up the mountain, reaching an altitude as high as 4,000 metres. I was amazed how the guides and trackers could distinguish between each gorilla within the groups they followed. Their skill came in very handy when I had to identify the animals by name in my captions.”“The money that built this school comes from tourism,” says Fabien Uwimana, a French and English teacher. “More children today can go to school.”Dana spent time in Hong Kong covering the pro-democracy protests. We published a gallery of Felipe’s projected and layered portraits of the protesters in October.“I also joined the AP team in Hong Kong covering the non-stop protests that are packing the streets almost every day for months now. Although I’m used to covering these kinds of protests, I was impressed by how determined and tireless they are. I was also surprised by how much they appreciated the work of the free press and were actually worried about our safety during the clashes. This respect for our profession and understanding of our role within society is something that unfortunately is becoming rare.”“In between all these stories, I also helped cover two elections in Spain, and multiple protests in Catalonia throughout the year. In one of the most recent protests in Barcelona I got hit by police with a baton in the face and earned a few stitches on my nose. Luckily it wasn’t too bad, I’ve recovered and am back to work now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b219db74d79ca58a16b04dff2cfa493993b4f9c/0_99_2740_1643/master/2740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdae15087a821a3a98abbfa0a3b80620","title":"magnum photographer josef koudelka holy land israel palestine documentary","story":"The Magnum photographer grew up behind the iron curtain. As a documentary charts his journey where Israel and Palestine meet, Koudelka talks about challenging official narratives – and himself There’s a surreal moment near the start of Koudelka Shooting Holy Land, a documentary about the acclaimed photographer Josef Koudelka. He has pointed his lens at one of the concrete barriers that separate Israel and Palestine but has been stopped by an official and a heavily armed soldier. His local assistant, Gilad Baram, is trying to smooth things over. “It might result in a book,” Baram tells the soldier. “He is a one of the most renowned photographers worldwide. He is a photographer with an agency called Magnum.”Suddenly the atmosphere changes. “Magnum? Ah, I know it,” says the soldier, his stern face breaking into a smile. A short discussion later, a friendly handshake and all is well.It is one of many quietly absurd scenes in Koudelka Shooting Holy Land, filmed on lengthy visits Koudelka took to the region between 2008 and 2012, making work that was published in the book Wall: Israeli and Palestinian Landscape. In another scene, Koudelka goes to a fake Arab city, built by the Israeli army for practice manoeuvres so realistic they even include actors pretending to sell vegetables in the “marketplace”. Later in the film, he observes a tour guide in Hebron, in West Bank, telling his group that, while they and Jewish settlers can walk freely up and down a particular street, the Palestinian residents can only go as far as “up to this door”.“These places have so much absurdity in them,” says Baram. “Of course, they are also a reminder of a painful reality. The film had to reflect that.”Baram was a photography student when he was assigned to help Koudelka, one of 12 international photographers invited to the region to participate in a group project, This Place. Driving Koudelka around, translating and facilitating access, Baram became fascinated by the journalist’s unique approach to photography, and started to film him. Initially, Koudelka was very suspicious.Initially, Koudelka didn’t want to work in Israel because he was wary of “getting mixed up” and emotionally involved – he paid for his first trip there himself so he wouldn’t feel beholden. Then Koudelka found himself deeply interested in the barrier built by Israel in the West Bank, which struck a chord because of his own experience of living behind the iron curtain.See it through his own eyes he does, as Baram’s film shows. Koudelka, who was in his 70s on these trips, worked long hours every day, walking along both sides of the barrier, speaking with those he encountered and taking photographs of the landscape. He returned to the same places over the years to see them at different times of the day or year, or in different weather.Baram’s film opens with a two-minute single, static shot of Koudelka at the fortified entrance road to Rachel’s Tomb. The photographer keeps shifting slightly to get the image exactly right. “You want to see everything, as much as possible, and to find the place where you think the photograph is waiting for you, and then build from these pieces a mosaic that can make a certain statement,” he explains.Such independence has characterised Koudelka’s long career. In 1968, he witnessed the Soviets violently suppress the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia and took to the streets, photographing the locals but also the invading soldiers. He didn’t feel hatred towards them, he says in the documentary. “I felt that what happened to them could happen to me. One night they could wake me up, put me on the tank, and I could be somewhere, in Warsaw or in Bucharest, in their situation. So then you’re a soldier and, in most cases, a soldier does what he is told to do.”For the past three decades, Koudelka has used a panoramic camera and photographed landscapes shaped by human activity. The scenes he depicts are usually devoid of people, but human actions have changed everything, whether it’s scarring the landscape with mines or huge concrete barriers, or building the roads, fortresses, and temples. These human interventions are an expression of power over the environment, and over each other. “Control over sources of water is one example,” he says. “You start by making roads – if you have the infrastructure, it helps you to establish your domination.”He believes people should interpret his photographs for themselves, but his images of the barrier in the West Bank are undeniably bleak. A long-distance shot of the Shu’afat refugee camp shows a nine-foot concrete barrier snaking all the way down from one corner of Koudelka’s wide panoramic image to the other his depiction of the entrance to Rachel’s Tomb shows the walls closing in like a prison.“Photography is so easy,” he says. “You just press the button. But photography is so difficult. There are some photographers, a few, who have got a vision. There are many more who have got a certain style. What is vision? It is, I think, where you were born, how you grow up, what sort of parents you had, the education you got, whatever happened to you, and how finally you get to a certain point. Style you can copy very easily. Vision, not really.”• Learn more about the documentary at koudelka-film.

This would be an achievement for any artist, but for one living in the 18th century, when lives and careers generally stopped at 40, it was extraordinary. Delany had spent decades being competent at all the usual “accomplishments” required of a genteel Georgian woman: embroidering napkins, sketching landscapes and, oddest of all, sticking sea shells to mantelpieces to make them look like plaster stucco. But at some point, sitting out in the garden in the golden late summer of 1772, she felt inspired to pick up her scissors and start snipping into coloured paper to see if she could recreate the shape of the plants spread out before her. Thrilled by the results, Delany wrote cock-a-hoop to her niece a few weeks later: “I have invented a new way of imitating flowers.”Actually, she had done a lot more. Far from making simple cut-outs, Delany had created a new kind of art (pictured right). Over the top of her petal template she would typically paste a multitude of smaller cuts to create shading and depth, which she then touched up with watercolour. One flower alone could easily contain more than 200 bits of paper. She called her work “mosaiks” we might describe them as mixed-media collage. More than mere botanical description, they function as a kind of floral portraiture, designed to show off a plant to its best advantage. Untidy leaves have been lopped off, droopy petals edited out, and the stamens sing with such hallucinatory colour that it feels as though they have transcended naturalism and now exist in a world of pure form.By the time of her death at the age of 88, Delany had produced almost a thousand flower images that were the delight and wonder of her smart social set. It had been in the magnificent gardens of the Duchess of Portland’s Bulstrode estate in Buckinghamshire that she had experienced her eureka moment. Joseph Banks, the celebrity naturalist, was an early fan of her work, while her later specimens were provided by no less a cheerleader than Queen Charlotte. Meticulously organised into 10 handsome albums, the Flora Delanica was bequeathed by a great-niece to the British Museum in 1897. Far from languishing in a dusty drawer along with all those other indecipherable traces of the vernacular past, Delany’s flowers remain some of the most visited works in the museum’s department of prints and drawings.The irresistibly odd shape of Delany’s life and work has previously attracted both popular and scholarly biographies, but Clarissa Campbell Orr hits the sweet spot between rigour and readability. In particular, she wants us to understand how the blazing serenity of Delany’s late-blooming art was born from decades of personal and political turbulence. At the age of 17 Mary Granville, the daughter of a disgraced minor Jacobite aristocrat, was married off for cash to a lechy 60-year-old called Alexander Pendarves, who had nothing but his profitable Cornish tin mine to recommend him. Released by his death after a mercifully short six years – gout galloped through Pendarves – Mary now embarked on a careful widowhood that lasted two decades.Campbell Orr is good at making us see why young Mary, who had missed out on becoming rich as a result of her rotten husband failing to update his will, nonetheless chose to turn down no fewer than eight proposals of marriage. There was a toxic bachelor called Lord Baltimore, whom she dubbed “the Basilisk”, and another man with a big fortune who struck her as simply “silly”. The offer from a widower with five young children naturally appalled her, as did a proposal from the doomy religious poet Edward Young, who, despite living in an age of Augustan wit, resorted to teasing her about her spider phobia.Rather than marry one of these buffoons, Mary carved out for herself a much pleasanter life as a free agent. She was careful to avoid any suggestion of being “light” by shunning gaming tables and keeping her friendships with men – John Wesley, Jonathan Swift, Horace Walpole – strictly platonic. Only when she was sure that her fertile years were behind her did she take a second husband, a nice Irish cleric called Patrick Delany, who soothed her soul even if he did not enrich her coffers.Quite why Mary turned, four years after Delany’s death in 1768, to cutting flowers out of coloured paper remains a mystery. And it is a great strength of Campbell Orr’s book that she doesn’t pretend to solve it. Nor does she insist on squeezing the Flora Delanica into a grand theory about the suppression of female artistic practice in the 18th century. Indeed, she admits that Delany’s productions, which straddle devotion and decoration, kitsch and craft, remain hard to place and difficult to decipher. But they are nonetheless gloriously easy to enjoy, and it is that sense of Delany’s life and work as a pleasurable puzzle that makes this exquisitely illustrated book such a treat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df33035fd49e7d3d23e370bf65a78cc385c28d9/0_249_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=578e1efe1ac5c61cd2db9258431604a9","title":"top 10 books about loneliness","story":"At what can be one of the loneliest times of year, a historian of emotion picks the best books about a modern maladyLoneliness is everywhere. Or so it seems. It’s been described in medical terms, as an epidemic, plague and infection. It has its own minister in the UK, Baroness Barran, with indications that other countries – Switzerland, Germany, maybe even the US – may follow suit.The problem is that loneliness is seldom defined. It’s often presented as an inidual, even universal, mental affliction. But loneliness is relatively new. The word comes into common usage around 1800, linked to social change – especially the secularity, alienation and competition produced by modernity. Before then it was solitude that interested writers and philosophers. Solitude could be problematic, but in a landscape forged by God, was one ever alone?Loneliness is different at different times. Yes, it can be desperate and crushing and agonising. But it can also be temporary, transitory, a “pinch-point” or life stage. Loneliness is not a single emotion but a mix of different feelings, including anger, resentment and fear as well as sorrow, grief and shame. It can even be pleasurable.As a historian of emotion, these complexities, and the absence of any existing extended historical inquiry, inspired my new book, A Biography of Loneliness. With case studies that include Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria and Thomas Turner, it explores the emergence of loneliness as a modern, physical and psychological affliction. And it considers the role played by political, social and economic factors (including the fact that the loneliest of all – homeless people and refugees – are not covered by the paper-thin umbrella of government concern).I chose these 10 books for what they have to say inidually, as well as what they represent collectively, about the historically changing meanings of loneliness. Many are written by women, because the connections between loneliness, creativity and gender are a neglected but critical aspect of modern and contemporary writing.1. Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1719)Drenched in the contemporaneous racism of crusaders and cannibals, Robinson Crusoe is often read as a study in religious redemption and a search for the self. Unlike Tom Hanks’s character in the Crusoe-inspired film Castaway (2000), Crusoe is not lonely. The word is never mentioned and he may rail at God, but the universe he inhabits has certainty and meaning.2. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818)This well-known tale (by a writer still, depressingly often, dismissed as “Shelley’s wife”) is one of the first fictive attempts to identify loneliness and social disconnect. Written when science was being “mastered”, and drawing on concerns about social alienation and the exploitation of nature, Frankenstein was also written when the word loneliness was just emerging. It contains just two references to loneliness (and one of those is a lonely road, reflecting its unemotional origin as a synonym for solitude). Yet the angst of Frankenstein’s monster, guilty of sin, abandoned and lost, expresses a remarkably familiar, modern version of loneliness.3. The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall (1928)One of the earliest, best-known accounts of lesbian experience in British and American culture, this novel raises important questions about gender, sexuality, and “belonging” broadly defined. Though its language of “sexual inversion” and “inverts” is archaic, the novel brought attention to the core themes of loneliness and alienation that resulted from early 20th-century anti-gay rhetoric. A recurring theme of LGBTQ+ discussions in the 21st century has been loneliness, especially when linked to mental illness and minority stress.4. A Writer’s Diary by Virginia Woolf (1953)By the 1940s, when “loneliness” was in widespread use to mean emotional isolation, Woolf wrote of its uses. For how else, other than through loneliness, could she disconnect from the world? Published posthumously by her husband Leonard, the book comprises extracts from the diaries she kept from 1918 until 1941, the year she died by suicide. It is filled with fascinating detail on her writing life and the Bloomsbury set of which she was part, as well as critical reflections on loneliness in a gendered world.5. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath (first published in 1963 under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas)Plath’s novel explores a loneliness that again stemmed from social expectation – this time, what it was to be a woman in the 1950s, juggling the expectations of work, domesticity and desire. The agonising loneliness and mental illness described by its narrator Esther Greenwood connect to Plath’s own life, as described in her journals and letters. Plath killed herself just one month after its publication.6. Journal of a Solitude by Mary Sarton (1973)An American poet and writer, Sarton wrote this book in order to record her experiences of depression and loneliness. The Journal was widely regarded as a landmark in women’s autobiography. Like Woolf, Sarton wrote about loneliness as necessary for creativity. But her writing also echoes Romantic ideas about the creator being in nature, and the need for physical connectedness to the world in order to belong.7. Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection by John T Cacioppo and William Patrick (2009)In the early 21st century, loneliness began to be a medical as well as a social concern. In light of an ageing population, with health risks attached to loneliness, post-industrial societies needed to look at causes. Together with his wife Stephanie, the late John Cacioppo (et al) undertook path-breaking work in the neuroscience of loneliness. This book was one of the first to describe loneliness as a form of contagion it gives a neuroscientific explanation for the physical damage caused by social isolation, from hearts and neurons to the immune system.8. The Lonely City by Olivia Laing (2016)Laing explores the paradox of loneliness in the city – multitudes of others alongside an “omnipresent, unanswerable feeling that I was in a state of lack”. She also considers the sense of blame attached (which reminds me of the dismissal of lonely people in the UK as “Billy no-mates”, as though they are lonely for a reason). Loneliness can bring creativity, too, Laing reminds us, via a (strikingly male) lineup of artists that includes Edward Hopper, Edward Darger and Andy Warhol.9. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (2017)The winner of the 2017 Costa first novel award, this book focuses on the eponymous social misfit, who is isolated and lonely. An abusive childhood, facial scarring and her social awkwardness contribute to her sense of being misunderstood. When asked how she is, she always replies: “Absolutely fine.” It is only when she befriends Raymond, or is befriended by him, that she begins to understand how to have a friend, and to belong.10. Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari (2018)Hari’s book is a reminder of how devastating loneliness can be, despite all its creative possibilities. This is an important study of depression as a social problem, against a backdrop of medical reductionism: depression as a problem of mind (or rather, brain). It is unmet need that Hari sees at the centre of rising levels of depression and anxiety. We are back to Cacioppo’s need for social connections – with Hari’s conclusion that their loss, as the book’s subtitle suggests, is the real cause of depression.• A Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion by Fay Bound Alberti is published by Oxford University Press.

Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020.Muilenburg’s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job.During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker’s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia.“You’re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?” Democrat Dina Titus challenged.Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package.His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m.In a statement on Monday, Boeing’s board said it had decided that “a change in leadership” was necessary to restore confidence. But it chose not to fire the executive, allowing him to keep his pay package and saving Boeing from the impression its most senior executive had done something wrong.But according to subsequent reports, it was not just the handling of 737 Max crisis or squabbles with the FAA that ultimately doomed Muilenburg.Last week, a high-profile launch of Boeing’s space capsule went awry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cce7fd29e884a60b2ebf01b4dfddab7b89d1cc9c/31_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91890cd8d052661af3e425688c1b82c5","title":"chinese western factories workers american factory globalisation british steel","story":"For Jill Lamantia, driving a forklift was the easy part of a hard life. Like countless other industrial workers in our hometown of Dayton, Ohio, Lamantia was excited that Fuyao Glass – a major Chinese company – had bought and reopened our abandoned General Motors factory. She had a job again.In her new role, after clocking off at the end of each shift, Lamantia retreated to a small brick house. Clutching spare keys, she would shut the front door and descend the stairs, squeezing past cleaning products on a mop rack. This Midwestern grandmother and former homeowner was living in her sister’s basement. Fuyao is the world’s leading automotive glassmaker. Based in China’s Fujian province, the company surprised many by exporting Chinese jobs to, of all places, America. In 2014 its billionaire founder, chairman and owner, Cao Dewang, saw the symbolic power in buying the gutted GM factory and rehiring scores of former employees such as Lamantia to make glass for the windscreens of motor vehicles manufactured in the US.One way this reverse globalisation could work, the chairman thought, was if the American factory workers took home less than half of the old GM wages. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but Daytonians were so desperate for jobs that they eagerly applied. Starting pay between 2014 and 2016 was $12 (£9.30) an hour. They thought this would soon rise rapidly.In our film American Factory we documented their hopes and the reality, charting the fortunes of the company and the workforce over three years.In the UK, where Chinese conglomerate Jingye has bid to buy British Steel, parallels can surely be drawn. GM’s future once seemed uncertain – after it declared bankruptcy and procured a government bailout – as British Steel’s future does now. Some believe that Jingye could save thousands of jobs. Others have nonetheless invoked American Factory as a cautionary tale of culture clash. Jingye has the benefit of taking over an operational factory with an existing workforce, while Fuyao acquired an empty shell. Still, it is unlikely that every job at British Steel will be saved. And salary cuts should be expected.We are not experts in labour law or foreign policy. We are citizens with cameras, who happen to be longtime residents of the community shaped by GM and Fuyao. From 2008, we chronicled the arc of loss, uncertainty and hope experienced at this facility. The result has been two films, beginning with The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant. For American Factory, Cao gave us generous access, letting us film unsupervised throughout Fuyao’s 130,000 sq m (1.4m sq ft) Ohio factory. We also accompanied a US delegation on a trip to Fuyao’s headquarters in Fuqing, Fujian province.While we certainly cannot forecast the fate of British Steel – the sale is still pending, and the terms have not been publicised – our experience in a western factory under Chinese management, with American and Chinese workers seeking mutual understanding, may offer a valuable perspective regarding wages, health and safety, unionisation and cultural distinctions.There was a time when working people in western, industrialised countries could get jobs that – in exchange for their skills and sweat and muscle – afforded them a decent middle-class life. Those jobs paid enough for families to send their kids to college to buy them musical instruments, swimming lessons, braces. American Factory shows that those days are over.Blue-collar people in China and western countries are on opposing trajectories. Prospects for Chinese workers have risen steeply, while employees in British and US factories have endured successive losses in income and financial security. These realities manifest in differing levels of acceptance about hard work for low pay.In China, a normal working week can include six or seven 12-hour days. Few may enjoy the rigorous schedule, but adhering becomes easier when everyone else is willing to work just as hard. Completing tasks with speedy efficiency is on some level a national duty, part of building their country. Americans in our film bristled at the idea of working such long and frequent shifts, especially when earning a fraction of their past wages. Their resistance was not only backed by US labour laws, but also rooted in dignity and pride.We were proud of the US workers who stood up for themselves at Fuyao. Lamantia refused to endanger the safety of her co-workers when ordered to lift a load she felt was too heavy for her forklift. She eventually joined her fellow workers in pushing for a labour union, aware they would likely be targeted and stripped of their jobs (Lamantia was fired, and later received a settlement from Fuyao after filing a claim with the National Labor Relations Board). It shouldn’t be so tough for people to defend what’s right, but it’s become that way.Expecting British and American industrial workers to be as competitive as the Chinese is unreasonable. Parents who work in western factories know that their children’s futures will be more precarious than the lives they knew. The most time-tested, statistically proven path for workers to reach a steady middle-class life is through union membership. Worker cooperatives, employee-owned businesses and employee-stock ownership programmes show additional promise, as they all provide some optimism to counter the bleak, established narratives.Since our film opened in August, we’ve found ourselves thinking more than ever about the future of work. Working people are under increasing productivity pressures, and wages are suppressed around the world, even as billionaires proliferate and stock markets roar. The workers at British Steel would be wise to question how many of their jobs can be automated under Jingye.There are organisations that have helped bring Chinese factory positions to the west without sacrificing worker integrity. Since 2013, the nonprofit Jobs to Move America has created more than 2,500 positions around the country, at times prioritising women, people of colour, veterans and former prisoners. By working closely with transport authorities in Chicago and Boston it has helped China Railroad Stock Corporation win more than $2bn in contracts to build local manufacturing plants.BYD – a Chinese bus manufacturer that now has a factory in California – was once hostile toward a possible employee union. Yet Jobs to Move America and other community groups convinced BYD to sign a neutrality agreement – a commitment on the part of an employer to not fight its employees’ efforts to organise themselves into a union. The chasm of global income inequality is greater than ever, and we must fight for better lives for industrial workers wherever they are – whether they be in the US, the UK, China or anywhere.• Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar are the directors of American Factory, available on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf73611d18a9667b030f29daea820a8057378c5/441_387_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f795e4e45ef37af1c9d071381e85b604","title":"tory promises govern britain conservatives power","story":"Beneath the surface disorder of modern British politics, there are steadier patterns to be found. One of them is so regular, and so central to the workings of the whole system, that it’s rarely noticed, let alone challenged.This pattern is hugely to the advantage of the Conservatives. Here’s how it works. When the Tories are in power, as they have been for 27 of the last 40 years, they often struggle to govern effectively. An election follows. The Tories run a negative campaign, drawing attention away from their own failures and ineptitude to the potential problems of a Labour government. To the surprise of some, the Tories win: either decisively or just well enough to stay in office. They announce that they will govern differently  this time. Much of the media believes them. The Tories struggle in government once again.Boris Johnson has already been through all these stages except the last one – and with a large majority, the temporary momentum that always follows a Queen’s speech and the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU next month to dangle before their supporters, the Conservatives will probably be able to enjoy promising things, rather than having to deliver them, for a while yet. This is Johnson’s favourite and most effective political mode. “Government will now engage flat-out on a programme of change for the better,” he pledged, with characteristic energy and vagueness, during the debate on the Queen’s speech. “A new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach.”In one sense, the Tories have earned this easy phase with their handsome election victory. In a democracy, why shouldn’t a re-elected government enjoy a honeymoon, when journalists and voters give them the benefit of the doubt ? Yet the credulity with which the promises of this and other returning Conservative administrations have been greeted, often by commentators who only weeks earlier were castigating the same ministers for their incompetence, suggests something more political is going on. There is damaging deference towards them – an unstated but widely held assumption that they shouldn’t be judged too exactingly by their record in office.The Labour party receives the opposite treatment. Even mistakes it made in government decades ago, in an entirely different political and economic context – such as failing to control the then powerful unions during the winter of discontent – are widely taken as warnings about how it would govern next time.Sometimes, the deference shown towards the Tories comes from left-of-centre journalists and reflects a pessimism that the Tories are, despite all their flaws, Britain’s natural ruling class. And sometimes it comes from the right and reflects an optimism that the Tories, however often they have disappointed and compromised in the past, always have the potential to rediscover their true path. “Politics has been transformed in a week,” declared the Daily  giddily after the election. “Suddenly they seem like a whole new party.”Either way, the media’s impulse to take incoming Tory premiers at their word echoes the inclination of many voters to trust Tory governments to be financially prudent, streetwise on foreign policy, and generally competent and stable – despite all evidence to the contrary. This misplaced confidence is particularly helpful to the current, broad-brush generation of Conservative politicians, who are better at rhetoric and election slogans than the detailed, patient work of improving the economy or the state.This faith in the Conservatives’ governing credentials helps them win tight elections. The idea that they will always find new ways to rule becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.Yet many Tories who have actually been in government are much less sure about their party’s aptitude for it. The memoirs of even the most confident and successful Conservative figures, such as Margaret Thatcher, are riddled with moments of self-doubt, frustration and sometimes outright panic while in office. John Hoskyns, a radical early Thatcherite who was the first head of her Downing Street policy unit, described the experience of government as like “trying to pitch a tent in the middle of a landslide”.But reviewers of such books tend to focus on the anecdotes about backstabbing and leadership coups – material suggesting that while the Conservatives might be a nasty lot, they are also assertive and pragmatic. Meanwhile, serialisations in the rightwing press are little more than descriptions of Tory triumphs. Thus the party’s aura of invincibility remains intact.This overestimation of the Conservatives’ capabilities is especially galling now, when we have a prime minister whose record of keeping promises and enacting major reforms is almost nonexistent. As mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, Johnson neglected the capital’s acute housing and air-quality crises, in favour of a little-used cable car across the Thames and the unbuilt airport scheme, “Boris island”. As foreign secretary from 2016 to 2018, he was widely considered one of the most clumsy and ineffective ever to hold office. And as prime minister so far, for all his electoral success, he has seemed just as casual about the business of government, giving vague, incoherent speeches, and sometimes appearing unable to understand or explain his own policies.This is the premier who is now expected to solve two huge problems: implementing Brexit and reviving swathes of northern England that have been declining for decades, and where the Tories have not, until now, been popular for almost a century. Meanwhile the government’s finances are deteriorating, Britain’s economic growth is slowing and a recession may be imminent. It could be the hardest set of challenges faced by a new government since the 70s.Johnson may learn to be more conscientious. Unexpected talents may emerge from a cabinet seemingly made up of fanatics and chancers. Dominic Cummings may metamorphose from a sly campaign strategist into someone who can reinvent the British state.But don’t hold your breath. Only three years ago, in her first speech as prime minister, Theresa May promised “to make Britain a country that works for everyone”, almost exactly as Johnson is doing now. Then as now, many observers thought they saw a potent new Conservatism crystallising. But it was a mirage.In truth, the Tories find governing grumpy old Britain – let alone reforming it – as difficult as Labour do. But if we don’t stop being mesmerised by them, they will carry on ruling us most of the time. And perhaps we’ll deserve it.• Andy Beckett is a  columnist and author of Promised You a Miracle: Why 1980-82 Made Modern Britain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9406f516ee0913b6591b2b4518cb9a34cad5908b/362_677_1699_1019/master/1699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f3014fdf511d853ebc36ad1b5289c","title":"60th birthday old age","story":"Having been denied all birthday celebrations until I left home at 16, I was always determined to mark subsequent birthdays well. I’d go to bed the night before in a juvenile state of anticipation and wake up ecstatic that I had survived another year, that I had proved them wrong and outrun the apocalypse. You see, I was brought up as a Jehovah’s Witness and believed I would die in 1976 when Armageddon came. I would never reach 30, 40 or 50 so I thought. So each birthday has been a shaken fist at the heavens well as a celebration.My 21st lasted three days: drink, drugs, dance and a very long sleep. I came to and felt I’d finally put the cruel denials to bed and maybe that a three-day party would last me a lifetime. But I had a party for my 30th, 40th and 50th. OK, not three days long but a bit of a bash that welcomed in the next decade. So far, so good. And next year I will be 60. I thought the prospect would feel the same. That I would sashay up to the date, throw my arms out and say “welcome” as I had to all the others. But this one feels different.I’ve been getting away with the term “middle age” since I turned 40. I assumed it started around then and ended at 55. Then I got to 55. I extended it, obviously. But it has to end. Next year, I can’t be middle aged any more. I must officially be old.I think of the other 60-year-olds I have known. My mother – worn down by housework and an unhappy marriage, frightened into righteousness by an oppressive religion – was definitely old at 60 and my father was dead at 68. Aunts and uncles and teachers and people I worked for were impossibly ancient at 60, they dressed in beige and had Velcro shoes and all seemed to smell of Vicks VapoRub. I know I will never be like that. But as it gets nearer I realise I will be entering into another realm, old age, the other tick box that is 59-plus. There’s never anything after 59, you are lumped in with the 70- and 80-year-olds as though we all think the same despite a possible 30-year age gap between us.At 60 I will be sent (my older sister assures me) a free bowel cancer check kit complete with a mini scoop to stick in your shit and send off in the post. I will get free prescriptions and eye tests. I think I get reduced admission to my local gym and a rail travel discount card. So even if you are unwilling to accept 60 and bury your head in the sand even if, like me, you are determined to see it as just another number, the world conspires to tell you that things have changed. And at least for me, they have.My 50s have been wonderful. I’ve become single and have had some great dates. I’m open to a new relationship, to flirting, to being wanted and sexual and expansive. I’ve found professional success writing books and essays, editing, teaching and encouraging other writers. I have used my voice to say what I think on behalf of working-class writers and marginalised people, and I’ve discovered in the Fuck-it Fifties that I truly do love myself with no apology or codicil. I have stopped looking for universal approval, worrying about fitting in and whether or not I wear, eat, read or say the right thing. But all that has come at a cost. I’ve been told I appear self-contained and intimidating, “fierce” is a word often used to describe me, all of which I find baffling.Far from being just another decade, I think 60 might be a turning point. Yes, I will flip from middle age to old age, but I may also flip from the Fuck-it Fifties to the Savour-it Sixties. Will I slow down? Will I soften round the edges? I have noticed I am already consolidating important friendships and sloughing off those that have become negative or “taking”, which is the only word I can think of to describe them. I hope to always be making new friends, and in my 60s there may be more time for that.There is, of course, the inevitable express train of time, hurtling away from you as you age. As 60 approaches, I do have the sense of time running out, or at the very least becoming more precious, which is the most cliched of all cliches but nevertheless true. I thought coming up to 60 would feel like just another birthday, but as it approaches I realise I was wrong. It does feel like something is about to end, and so, of course, something is about to begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350da25e0daedaf511f6d9d39b541aaaa1e3979d/0_4_1268_761/master/1268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd1a661464f8c652d1633726bce9b0fd","title":"print out and complete the observers giant christmas crossword","story":"A bumper festive challenge from the Observer New Review.

By 2025 there will be more than 330, based on an analysis of company announcements.New European Union rules come into force on 1 January that will heavily penalise carmakers if average carbon dioxide emissions from the cars they sell rise above 95g per kilometre. If carmakers exceed that limit, they will have to pay a fine of €95 (£79) for every gram over the target, multiplied by the total number of cars they sell.The excess emissions bill would have been £28.6bn on 2018 sales figures, according to analysis by the automotive consultancy Jato Dynamics, illustrating the extent of the change required by carmakers over a short period of time. Jato analyst Felipe Muñoz said there will still be large fines, as companies keep selling profitable internal combustion engine cars and struggle to bring down EV prices to parity with their fossil-fuel peers.“It is very difficult for carmakers to change manufacturing infrastructure in such a short period of time,” Muñoz said.However, some analysts take a more sceptical view of the industry that spawned the Dieselgate scandal, in which Volkswagen and Daimler were shown to have deliberately cheated emissions regulations. Carmakers successfully lobbied for a rule that means cars emitting less than 50g of carbon dioxide per kilometre are eligible for so-called super-credits, a controversial policy which means that every electric vehicle sold counts as two cars. That makes it easier for carmakers to meet their targets, even if average emissions from their cars are actually higher than the rules stipulate.Multiple new electric car models will go on sale just in time to qualify for EU regulations. In November the first of Volkswagen’s ID.3 cars rolled off a new electric production line in Zwickau, eastern Germany, that will be able to produce 330,000 vehicles a year by 2021. The first of BMW’s Mini Electric models, made in Oxford, will arrive in showrooms in March. Vauxhall, owned by France’s PSA Group, will start production of its Corsa-e in January, with sales to begin in March.Sales of pure electric vehicles will still be dwarfed by those of cars with conventional fossil-fuel engines, as well as hybrids that use both battery and internal combustion power. However, the electric vehicle surge is likely to contribute to significant price reductions, as carmakers compete for buyers beyond the early adopters willing to pay a premium.Consultants at Deloitte estimate the market will reach a tipping point in 2022, when the cost of ownership of an electric car is on par with its internal combustion engine counterparts. Separate research by the International Council on Clean Transportation suggested this was already the case in February in five European countries, including the UK.In the UK, some drivers anxious about the short range of electric vehicles on a single charge will be put off from buying them until the development of charging infrastructure spreads across the country. However, scandals such as Dieselgate have made investors “acutely aware” of the need to increase electric sales and comply with emissions regulations, according to Arlene Ewing, a director at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.“Brand is all to a carmaker and failure to meet the deadline may adversely affect their brand, reputation and, ultimately, sales,” she said. “We have seen this before. Consumers tend to be brand loyal.”Rising demand from consumers has also filtered through to used electric cars: listings website CarGurus found that second-hand prices of some models had risen during 2019. Tom Leathes, the chief executive of rival car sales platform Motorway, said the market was growing “extremely fast”, despite the complications of selling cars that include separately leased batteries.“We expect this segment to grow year on year for at least another 10 years as electric’s share of the new car market continues to grow exponentially,” Leathes said.Volkswagen ID.3Price: under £26,000, range: 205 miles, due in early 2020The “third-generation” mass-market vehicle from the world’s largest carmaker will be swiftly followed by the ID.4 SUV, on the same electric vehicles platform, and production will be carbon neutral, VW claims.Vauxhall Corsa-ePrice: £26,490, range: 209 miles, due in April 2020Along with the Mini, the Corsa is one of the first of the UK’s perennial bestsellers to get an electric makeover. It shares its core parts with Peugeot’s e-208, another of the PSA Group’s key superminis.Tesla Model YPrice: about £30,300, range: 230 miles, production to start in summer 2020The latest model from the company that kicked off the electric car race will be the Model Y, a compact SUV that can fit seven people. The Model Y will eventually be built on the same site as a recently announced Tesla battery plant in Berlin.Ford Mustang Mach-EPrice: about £35,000, range: 370 miles, expected late 2020The Mustang Mach-E is aimed at the booming family-friendly SUV market. The car will be the first all-electric vehicle from the US carmaker, which has been slow to develop new sources of power.Fiat 500 ElectricPrice: about £28,000, range: tba, due in late 2020Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has been an emissions laggard because of its gas-guzzling Jeep. The company’s first fully electric car, the redesigned 500 Electric, will be made in its Mirafiori factory near Turin, with a right-hand drive version launched late in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a38e1026dc873712bb00bb3e927573bf4ae06e/0_269_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e99631b4a5f9d922e9773a296c8a4e","title":"ten wildlife conservation success stories 2019 aoe","story":"There has not been much good news for life on Earth this year, with up to 1m species at risk of annihilation, many within decades.

But, if you went along looking for fashion inspiration … you will have fared no better.In his one-star review, this paper’s critic Peter Bradshaw characterised the film’s female lead as a “mix of Bridget Jones and the quirky sister from Notting Hill” – a description that also works in terms of her clothes, with Emilia Clarke’s Kate veering from an elf costume to a leopardprint fur coat throughout.Thankfully, there are plenty of other festive favourites that will reliably warm your cockles and ignite your fashion sensibilities. Here’s a quick guide to finding your 2020 style muse from the comfort of your sofa this Christmas.If it’s power suits and shoulder pads you’re after, this film is full of them – but it’s in the characters’ downtime that you’ll find a look that the majority of us lean towards at this time of year: comfy, chunky knitwear. Elizabeth Perkins, starring as Cole’s Department Store’s employee Dorey Walker, pairs hers with pearls, which are having a moment right now (blame The Crown plus the fact that they appeared on the autumnwinter catwalks at Erdem, Simone Rocha and Emilia Wickstead). Bonus points for Mara Wilson’s very on-trend collection of padded headbands.Ignore Mary Hatch’s frothy dancing dress and fast forward Violet’s proto-Reformation ruffle mini: it’s George Bailey’s long-sleeve, turtleneck-style rugby shirt that you want to draw inspiration from here. Vintage styles, such as this one, featured on the autumnwinter catwalk at Burberry, Wales Bonner and Xander Zhou – but they’re also perfect for a Christmas Day walk, or a Boxing Day sofa slump. Pair with a big mug of eggnog and talk of lassoing the moon.Proof that bad films can be the bearers of good fashion. Halle Berry, stuck in blue scrubs for much for this Razzie-nominated romcom, gets to wow in a hot-pink party dress – albeit for a Skype date with her husband, who is serving in Afghanistan. No matter – at least Nurse Aimee taps into the colour palette that dominated this year’s Oscars in February and was still being worn by everyone from Shania Twain to Dua Lipa at the AMAs last month.For those for whom Christmas is all about spending the day in your PJs, look no further than Carol. Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett showcase all manner of enviable hats, coats and wiggle dresses throughout the course of this film – but it’s Blanchett’s chic jammies and tartan housecoat that provide lounging aspiration. Wear to drink cocktails while listening to records and spritzing yourself with stocking-filler perfumes.Sally Albright is a fashion icon any day of the year, but particularly at Christmas, when her red roll-necks, brown blazer jackets and snazzy perm really come into their own. No one looks cool singing into a shop karaoke machine – least of all Billy Crystal’s Harry Burns – but Meg Ryan gives it a good go in high-waisted denim and a cream high-neck sweater not unlike that seen on the catwalk at Roksanda. Ideal if you still get cold when it’s 71 degrees out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ada6c5ed328a20fd5f49223150a721a58eae254/42_597_1887_1132/master/1887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3eee28704cee5ce74129894d9591783","title":"yule look great what to wear on christmas day in pictures","story":"Asymmetrical skirts, sparkling earrings and ‘disco bags’ – here are five looks that will get you in the festive mood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0308fb29e0063ba28ca96536d38d1046b116ddef/254_0_2499_1500/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b3eaded8eac98a7d50dfd75554e081a","title":"cant believe the negative publicity your reviews of cats","story":"The anticipated film adaptation of Cats is in cinemas but was it a purr-fect masterpiece or did it lose the plot? Here are your reviewsMy daughter and I saw the stage show in London for her 18th birthday and loved it. We saw the film yesterday and love the film now! Superb choreography, terrific sets and some wonderful singing especially from Jennifer Hudson. The critics are not always right! SnowpenguinAn already weak musical became even weaker with this adaptation. The entire movie is spent trying to stay awake through boring scenes ploughing through a boring story, sung by bad singers. There is one good song, which is the only reason the movie deserves a one star review rather than a zero. It was so bad I still feel shame when I look my cat in the eyes. Christoffer Oqvist, 24, Burton-upon-TrentI enjoyed the film and would give it 35 stars. I grew up with dance classes every weekend and have lovely memories of performing Cats in our annual show. It of course is a weird storyline, but the songs are just brilliant. So in terms of being adapted to a movie I knew in part I would love it. However, I was disappointed with the CGI which at times looked really fake and unnecessary. You have incredible dancers that need no CGI as evidenced when you watch the stage show, often less is more. I do feel it is a great cast and already have the soundtrack on repeat. Hazel, 37, BristolFrom the first moment this film had me hooked. Beautifully shot and delightful in every way. Francesca Hayward is stunning but for me the stand out performance is by Jennifer Hudson, heart wrenching and magnificent. I am already planning to go and see it again. I cannot understand the bad reviews at all, I cannot see anywhere that it could be improved. Amanda Clabon, 60, HertfordshireIt’s precisely because of articles and reviews like this one that I decided I just had to see Cats. Surely it couldn’t be that bad, could it? It was positively jaw-dropping, particularly the scene with the mice children and Rebel Wilson scarfing down the tap dancing cockroaches. In other words, it’s the must-see movie of the season. The theatre was packed. Where did they go right? CardinalAstonishingly ill-conceived mind fart. These ‘cats’ try so hard to be sexy but fail. They come across as merely perverse. The body dysmorphia is stunningly wrong and at one point James Corden receives a blow to the nether regions and registers discomfort. This is odd because there is nothing ‘down there’ for either gender in this achingly weird film. That struck the perfect low note for me. Colin Young, 58, LondonBrilliant, colourful, superb costumes, CGI, and cat movements were excellent. Great adaptation to film. We really enjoyed it and can’t believe the negative publicity it has been given. It helped knowing the poems and still believe the West end show is better, however a great film and would thoroughly recommend people go and make their own judgement. Angela Nutt, 55, New ForestI’ve just been to see it and I LOVED it. There I said it. I loved the singing (all top notch), I loved the choreography and I really loved Jennifer Hudson singing memory – she is amazing. I don’t know why everyone is acting perplexed about plot and believability, it was mental when it was a poem and it was bonkers when made into a musical and it is still deranged as a movie – but that’s part of the joy and eccentricity of it. There is a lot of CGI overkill which is wasted when you’ve got good performers anyway, and you need to get over the furry nudity, but it’s ace! rloliver1792I could have done without watching this. Ian McKellen’s attempt to groan a painful meow and his milk licking scene was bad enough but Rebel Wilson’s crutch inducing scene was an anti-climax. The scene where the human cockroaches were swallowed alive was just distasteful and Idris Elba looked weird, not wonderful. Having said all that my wife loved it! She said it was touching, beautiful and moving! Well, at least one of us enjoyed it. I’ll just have to erase it from my ‘memory’. Hola Garip, 58, LondonI thought it was one of the best pieces of ballet I’ve seen in a long time. The costumes were fantastic the way the dancers imitated the feline movements of a cat was awesome. The emotions were so believable and I was mesmerised from beginning to end. So much so that I will buy the movie to keep and watch over and over again. Pamela Cobley, 82, WalesAfter reading through so many negative reviews my 11-year-old daughter and I were unsure what to expect when we bravely went to see the film. We are already fans – I’ve seen it three times in the theatre. I thought the music in the film was well done, I enjoyed the characterisation which was given more focus than in the theatre. The musical has never really had much of a storyline but it did have a bit more in the film. I didn’t like the use of CGI in some dance moves but enjoyed the choreography of Skimbleshanks and watching ballet star Francesca Hayward as Victoria. I think it’s a bit like Marmite and if you are already not a fan then this probably won’t massively change your mind but we enjoyed watching it.

The way Ramsey was allowed to leave last summer rankles among Arsenal fans but he eclipses Laurent Koscielny as the club’s best performer of the decade. Paul ChronnellThe goalkeeper was likened to Superman by Gordon Strachan after a superlative performance for Blackburn and he continued to avoid kryptonite after moving to Villa in 2008. Friedel proved to be a rock-like presence behind Martin O’Neill’s defence and while he only played one year for Villa this decade – he joined Tottenham in June 2011 – his service was immense. In a game at Manchester United in February 2011, Friedel also became the club’s oldest player at the age of 39 years and 259 days. Ian MalinPerhaps the best £170,000 Bournemouth have ever spent. The defender has racked up more than 300 appearances since turning a loan deal from Brighton into a permanent move seven years ago, when the club were 10th in League One. Cook, who cut his teeth in non-league football, has been the epitome of consistency and a cornerstone of Bournemouth’s extraordinary rise to the Premier League under Eddie Howe. Ben FisherA difficult decision but, in the end, Dunk gets the nods over Bruno. As the song says, the 28-year-old defender has been with Brighton from Withdean to Wembley having been born in the town, attended secondary school there and spent his youth career at the club, signing his first professional contract with Brighton in 2010. Dunk, named captain by current manager Graham Potter, is fearless, great in the air and even chips in with a few goals – in 2014-15 he was Brighton’s top scorer. Stephanie FinchamBarnes has come to epitomise Burnley in his seven seasons at Turf Moor. The 30-year-old striker has played in all five Premier League campaigns under Sean Dyche, growing in stature and scoring more often with each one. The former west country journeyman is now an established top-flight performer and while his style might not be the prettiest, he, like the club itself, is persistent, effective and awkward to play against. Paul WilsonForget about the last decade, the Belgian is one of the greatest players ever seen at Stamford Bridge. His creative genius brought him plenty of inidual accolades during his seven years in England and he proved an inspirational figure during Chelsea’s title triumphs of 2015 and 2017, under José Mourinho and Antonio Conte respectively. No doubt, Premier League defenders were relieved when Hazard left last summer to join Real Madrid. Jacob SteinbergOnly Julian Speroni even comes close to matching the impact of the player who grew up a stone’s throw from Selhurst Park. Having made his debut for Palace in March 2010, Zaha has racked up almost 300 appearances for the club – having briefly flown the nest to Manchester United as Sir Alex Ferguson’s last signing there – and without him the south Londoners would never have played a record seven straight top-flight campaigns. Ed AaronsA £60,000 purchase from Sligo Rovers in January 2009 and Everton and Republic of Ireland captain today. A humble, dignified and proud figure who developed into one of the finest full-backs in the Premier League over the course of the decade (Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka have played more matches for Everton than Coleman but were already regulars before his arrival) and he epitomises the kind of spirit, and signing, the club desperately need to find again. Andy HunterFrom a goalscoring debut against Torquay United to match-winning performances in the Premier League and Champions League, Vardy has done it all with Leicester, mostly with a lovable snarl. The striker could have followed Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kanté out the door after spearheading the title triumph in 2016 but he stayed and is now leading another charge for glory. Leicester fans love him, England fans miss him, and Premier League defenders will have a party when Vardy retires. Paul DoyleA troubling figure, and not a member of Jürgen Klopp’s golden generation, but no player lit up Liverpool this decade quite like Suárez. There were the moments – the shot against Arsenal, the goal against Newcastle, the goals against Norwich – as well as the relentless work-rate and desire, all of which combined in the 2013-14 season as the Uruguayan led Brendan Rodgers’s men on their thrilling and ultimately doomed title charge. The most talented player in Liverpool’s history? Quite possibly. Sachin NakraniThe Spaniard will depart the Etihad Stadium next summer after a decade of midfield play that has been akin to Picasso in his cubist period: a one-off exhibition of unique artistry. Silva is peerless and has been fundamental to the success City have enjoyed during his time at the club, most notably their four Premier League titles. Now aged 33 it is no surprise Silva’s powers have been on the wane this season and, as a result, so too have City’s fortunes. Jamie JacksonDe Gea was United’s No 1 goalkeeper in their 2012-2013 title-winning campaign – the second and final occasion the club were crowned champions this decade – and in the seven years since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club the Spaniard has been the sole world-class presence at Old Trafford. In the fog of disarray that has so often occurred in front of him, De Gea has proven to be - the odd dip in form aside - a beacon of excellence. JJFor a time Tioté – who tragically died at the age of 30 following a cardiac arrest sufferered while training with Beijing Enterprises – was the most uncompromising holding midfielder in England. The Ivorian began his seven-year stint on Tyneside in 2010 and will always be remembered for his stunning 25-yard equalising volley in the 4-4 draw with Arsenal in February 2011. His midfield partnership with Yohan Cabaye was also integral to Newcastle’s fifth-place finish in 2011-12. Louise TaylorKnown to Norwich fans as ‘Wessi’, Hoolahan was an integral part of three promotions and four Premier League seasons. More importantly, he set the tone. Norwich have been up and down a lot during the past 10 years but they have settled on a style of play that values short passing, technique and brains above brawn. The diminutive Irishman embodied all of those qualities during his time at Carrow Road and earned a testimonial, too. Paul MacInnesSharp technically started the decade as a United player, albeit transfer listed and on loan at Doncaster as his second spell at the club fizzled out. He left. Again. He came back. Again. He made his third debut for the club in the 4-0 defeat at Gillingham with which United opened the 2015-16 League One season and two promotions and 90 goals later (for a club total of over 100), the 33-year-old striker is a bona fide Blades legend. John AshdownAfter five unforgettable years and 117 goals, Lambert left Southampton a hero. He initially joined the club in League One as a serial goalscorer with Bristol Rovers and fired them to the Championship and the Premier League, form which earned the striker a call-up to the England squad at the age of 31 and, in 2014, a move to boyhood club Liverpool, where things did not work out. Lambert retired two years ago after spells at West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City. Ben FisherKane brings the romance and the connection with the Tottenham fanbase he brings a work ethic that demands more of himself and those around him every day and, above all, he brings goals – over 170 of them since his debut for Spurs in August 2011, following a loan spell at Leyton Orient. Luka Modric and Gareth Bale were joys to watch for Spurs at the start of the decade but make no mistake – Kane is the symbol of the club. David HytnerThis has unquestionably been the Deeney decade. The forward has been at Watford for all but the first six months of it, and though initially underwhelming – his first season saw 17 league starts and just two goals – he has grown enormously as a player and as a person, with the team’s travails during his three-month injury absence this season demonstrating the captain’s continued importance as its spiritual figurehead. Simon BurntonIt ended in tears but there was nothing quite like it when Payet was in the mood. Signed for £10m from Marseille in June 2015, the Frenchman’s flicks, tricks and free-kicks were the undisputed highlight of West Ham’s final season at Upton Park. His skill was unrivalled and he managed an unforgettable solo goal against Middlesbrough before returning to Marseille in protracted manner in January 2017. JSNo player better embodies Wolves’s rise than the Irishman, who was not even a regular first-team player for Bohemians before joining the club for £80,000 in the summer of 2010. After a couple of loan stints, Doherty has soared to every challenge, progressing from League One through the Championship and into the Premier League and the Europa League, where the 27-year-old is now one of the best wing-backs in the business.

It means the dark days before Christmas and, for Sunderland, they can never have felt shorter or bleaker.The winter solstice may just have passed, leaving the earth starting to tilt towards the sun once again but, at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light, there can be no guarantees that spring will bring a rebirth of warmth and brightness.Sunderland are preparing for Bolton’s Boxing Day visit sitting almost as low in League One as the winter sun which, on Monday, struggled to break through the December gloom to shine weakly on what remains their top-end Premier League-class training facility, the Academy of Light.Phil Parkinson’s side are 13th – the lowest position in their sometimes illustrious history – with the manager deemed under pressure barely two months after succeeding Jack Ross.If it seemed dubious at the time, hindsight has made the decision to sack Ross, with the team sixth in the table and within touching distance of the automatic promotion places, look increasingly poor and panicky.The problem was that the intelligent, talented Scot – who was swiftly snapped up by Hibernian – had narrowly missed out on taking Sunderland to the Championship last season and fears of another failure perhaps clouded the judgment of the owner, Stewart Donald.Parkinson has a decent body of work behind him, doing very good jobs at assorted clubs including Bradford – remember that wonderful run to the League Cup final? – and Bolton, but he tends to start slowly and Sunderland are a club in a desperate hurry to return to the Premier League.Right now football’s promised land looks an awfully long way away and, with Donald having recently taken a £9m loan from FFP – a company consisting of a small group of American investors with close links to Michael Dell, of Dell computers – the future is shrouded in uncertainty.Should Donald fail to repay that loan, FFP would take charge of a club which, not so long ago, was put on the market for £170m by its former owner, the American billionaire Ellis Short.While this could be a very good thing – if Dell were to get involved Sunderland would gain heavyweight financial muscle – nothing is guaranteed. After all, the training ground is in the upmarket Cleadon area of Sunderland and occupies precisely the sort of invitingly large site which property developers would relish turning into expensive luxury homes.Meanwhile the team itself has turned distinctly downmarket. A recent picture of two players, the former Celtic winger Aiden McGeady – since transfer-listed and working with the under-23s following a “training ground incident” – and Chris Maguire tucking into a post-match meal at a McDonald’s on the way back from a 1-0 defeat at Gillingham appeared emblematic of plummeting standards.So far Parkinson has presided over only two wins and has, damningly, said: “Is it the greatest dressing room I’ve been part of? Probably not.”Following a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Blackpool this month, Parkinson swerved post-match media duties, claiming “he needed a break” but he was back facing the microphones and endeavouring to be as upbeat as possible on Monday.“This is a critical period for us,” said Parkinson, reminding everyone that his side are only six points off a play-off place. “In the next block of four games we have to aim to get back into the top six or pretty close to it.”Flags at the Stadium of Light have been fluttering at half-mast since Friday when Billy Hughes, a vital attacking spark in Sunderland’s 1973 FA Cup-winning team, died at the age of 70 and a minute’s silence will precede kick-off against Bolton.The crowd is likely to be significantly down on this time last year when a 46,039 gathering shattered the League One attendance record by filling the stadium for a 1-0 Boxing Day win against Bradford.Back then Sunderland seemed set fair for automatic promotion with Josh Maja scoring freely but the January transfer window saw the young striker sold to Bordeaux and the team’s fortunes have never properly recovered.Despite a tight budget, Parkinson hopes to redress the balance next month. “I know what I need to be successful,” he said on Monday. “I’m working hard to get this team into a position where we can challenge. We must get more out of the players but, of course, we’d also like to improve the squad.”The boardroom has recently been fortified by the appointment of two new non-executive directors, the North Yorkshire-born, Sunderland-supporting Sky Sports presenter David Jones and Tom Sloanes, a Wearside-born businessman, but whether or not celebrations are in order before the summer solstice will be principally down to Parkinson’s players.His USA international, Lynden Gooch, not only believes Sunderland can rise to the challenge but disputes claims the dressing room is ided. “It’s a good group of lads,” he maintains. “When Jack Ross was here he changed a lot and got a lot of good lads in now we’ve just got to stick together.“We’ve been through a lot, especially missing out on promotion by one win last season, but we’re still aiming to go up automatically. If you put three wins together on the bounce you’re in the top two, that’s how close this league is.“You can’t get too down because you’re not going to get any success if you do that. Phil Parkinson hasn’t really had too much time on the training pitch to properly implement what he wants but we know we’ve got the quality. We’ve just got to keep plugging away and things will turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f926ec0ef4864fec10ee074650fda3126d56543/0_30_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26e3e40734dc8eb969988008d46e0116","title":"david squires on 24 vaguely festive football images from 2019","story":"Our resident cartoonist has created a 2019 advent calendar to fill you with football seasonal cheer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5a3f29b03197737a1b1df6fef0425efc16512b/0_301_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6a44cc166b7912a0f9268b0a6b64028","title":"mistletoe the christmas tradition we show no sign of kissing goodbye to","story":"The plant has been treasured for millennia, celebrated in mythology and is now the basis of a booming seasonal businessIt’s not the holidays without Nat King Cole’s 1946 hit The Christmas Song blasting from your radio as you go to pick up your tree, and nowadays, that song might also remind you to pick up some mistletoe.The strange tradition of kissing beneath mistletoe has withstood the test of time. The 19th-century American author Washington Irving wrote about the practice in one of his books, saying: “The mistletoe is still hung up in farm-houses and kitchens at Christmas,” documenting the ritual. “The young men have the privilege of kissing the girls under it, plucking each time a berry from the bush. When the berries are all plucked, the privilege ceases.”Back then, the principal way to get mistletoe was by climbing up a tree, and hacking it off with an ax. But in 2019, you can walk right into Walmart, Trader Joe’s or your neighborhood garden supply shop and buy a nicely boxed swatch.In modern times, Hallmark movies and the ever-popular Burl Ives Holly Jolly Christmas song are happy to remind folks on the usage of mistletoe.“Oh ho, the mistletoe, hung where you can see. Somebody waits for you, kiss her once for me,” croons Ives in the song. Triumph Oregon has been selling mistletoe for 20 years from Oregon. Recently acquired by Enroot Products and FibreDust LLC, the company sells mistletoe to Amazon, Walmart, Trader Joe’s and more than 250 other small garden shops, suppliers and distributors.The plant is harvested in the forests across the north-western state, an annual process that is very labor intensive for the three to four weeks of the holiday season.It grows high up in the trees, and laborers climb the trees, cut the mistletoe, then send to processor Trillium Gardens for cleaning and cutting into smaller pieces. The final product is tied up in a small bow, boxed and shipped nationwide. “Anyone can go to Michael’s and buy a plastic thing, but people want to see a real product. It was actually alive,” said Enroot’s Andrew Pidgeon.The orders start coming in as early as October, but the plants can’t be shipped until closer to the festive season – they can easily sweat and grow mold. Mistletoe is shipped a day after it’s cut to avoid that, and only for the four to five weeks around Thanksgiving to the New Year.But even small-town retailers are getting in on the action. At Mistletoe Tree Farm in Massachusetts, owner Megan Krugger buys from another wholesaler in Oregon, usually around 200 swatches a year. “We almost sell out every year. Customers get their tree, and purchase a sprig of mistletoe,” she told the .In Virginia, Amy Reese is a vendor at the Lynchburg Community Marketplace, a year-round farmer’s market and craft fair. Reese sells wreaths and mistletoe, retailing the plant at two to five dollars a bundle, depending on the size.She and her children collect mistletoe by climbing trees or using lobbers, baskets with metal around them on a very long stick. She says it grows on oak and apple trees, among other hosts. “I tell people to get the one with the most berries,” she said. “You’re supposed to take one off every time you kiss someone. I find it fun.” The family ends up selling at least 100 bundles a year.Her advice for prolonging the life of the plant is to put it in the refrigerator when it’s not in use to avoid molding, or to put a piece with the stems in water.Mistletoe hasn’t always been for kissing. In Ancient Greek and Roman times, it was used to treat menstrual cramps, ulcers and epilepsy. Druids thought that the plant promoted fertility.Some folklore says that in Norse mythology, the goddess of love, Frigg, secured an oath from all the animals and plants in the world that they wouldn’t harm her son Baldur, whose death was foretold. She forgot mistletoe, which another god used to kill Baldur.He was eventually resurrected and a relieved Frigg proclaimed the plant a symbol of love meant to be kissed under.The scientific name for American mistletoe is Phoradendron, which is aptly translated into Greek as “tree thief”. It latches itself, similar to a parasite, on to the branches of its host and takes water and nutrients out of it, often killing the tree. Mistletoe berries are toxic to humans, but birds ingest them, and spread the growth.There are some concerns over how human-caused climate change will affect mistletoe, which is at the mercy of the health of its host tree. “There’s definitely less of it. This year we had issues on how much we could harvest, and increasingly, you have to go further into the woods to find it,” said Pidgeon.

For 11 months after withdrawal on 31 January, the UK will stay in the EU’s single market and customs union. But it will no longer be a member state and officials in Brussels expect the location of the talks to be split.The shift is expected to be confirmed in “talks about talks” due between the UK and EU negotiators in February, sources said. A government spokesman said: “The political declaration makes clear that the UK and EU have to jointly agree the scheduling of talks. More details will be set out in due course.”Negotiations on the future relationship are expected to start in earnest in early March. EU member states are due to adopt their negotiating position on issues such as trade in goods, fisheries, security and level playing field demands on 25 February after the publication of a draft paper in the first week of the month.A leaked diplomatic note seen by the  said: “The mandate will contain no surprises and will be based on the political declaration.There is no expectation that the 11-month transition period will be extended beyond the end of 2020. An EU official said: “The member states have been told it is not happening.”But the June summit of EU leaders – without UK involvement – is expected to be a pivotal point in the negotiations and will signal whether hope remains of securing at least a “bare bones” deal on trade, fishing rights and security by the end of the year.On trade in goods, the EU’s negotiating position is yet to be finalised, with seminars for diplomats organised from 8 January up to the end of the month.But the level playing field demands in the 2018 Irish protocol, which would have tied the UK to the EU’s customs union, are seen as a baseline below which Brussels will not go.Theresa May had committed the UK to dynamically aligning with future EU changes to competition and state aid rules in the “Irish backstop”.The commitment on environmental protections and social and labour standards was to not lower them.Sources suggested the French government might seek to toughen the demands further during internal EU discussions in February.“The French said at the time that they negotiated the Irish backstop and its provisions in the name of peace, and that this would be different,” said one EU source. “The aim in February will be to have everyone owning the strategy.”An EU source said: “The issue is not whether the UK will seek to undercut the EU but whether they could, and therefore it holds us back in our own policymaking. That’s the problem.”Suggestions from Whitehall that the UK would accept tariffs on some goods as the price for erging from EU standards have concerned officials in Brussels. “If we start talking about tariffs, there is no chance of a trade deal by the end of the year, as it becomes a very complicated discussion among the member states,” one source said.A major strand of the talks is expected to be related to security issues. “How do we extradite someone, for example?” asked one EU source. “It won’t be the European arrest warrant, but we need something between that and nothing. It has to be there – it would be unforgivable if it was not.“There also needs to be agreement on sanctions. You can just coordinate, with the UK tagging on to EU decisions, but that makes sanctions less likely to be supported in the courts. You need a formal agreement.”On fisheries, the political declaration obliges the EU and the UK to make “best endeavours” to agree on future access to British waters by 1 July, but Brussels sources are sceptical as to whether such a deal can be struck in that time.“Without an agreement on fish, there will not be a deal – the price for a trade deal is the level playing field demands and fishing rights,” said an EU source. “But in reality, we don’t have to agree it by the summer, just the end of the year.”Gerard van Balsfoort, the chair of the European Fisheries Alliance, a lobby group representing the fishing fleets of the member states most affected by Brexit, said there needed to be certainty each year on the allocation.“Of course, if the UK is outside the EU, it will have their own fisheries policy and they will be an independent coastal state, and everything will not remain the same,” he said.“But the real issue with fisheries is where can you fish, and how much. And with these two things, it is easy: we have the quota sharing set in stone. And we want an agreement that reflects what we have now.“You can ask whether that is realistic, but the UK points to Norway. With Norway, the quotas are set in stone. There is an allocation key from the early 1980s. And that hasn’t changed.”An EU source said: “In reality, if we can’t agree on fish then we really are in trouble.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf93b306a89bf7f06e9483a4b424c2dc3b74d0b/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae57b64c2892a76a51bdfe2b1442cd1","title":"sadiq khan urges pm work with him to end rough sleeping","story":"London mayor speaks at Christmas Eve event for 100 homeless people at City HallOne hundred homeless people spent Christmas Eve afternoon at City Hall in London, where the mayor, Sadiq Khan, said society was letting down those without homes.Amid the festive cheer of the first ever such event – where Khan helped serve a three-course lunch of smoked salmon, roast turkey and pear tart before many took to karaoke – people spoke of their struggles accessing services and the omnipresence of drugs, as well as opportunities to gamble, on the streets.“You’re made to scream for help and unless you do that it doesn’t come,” said Scott, a 45-year-old who slept in a park for a year. “You have to fight tooth and nail for what you are entitled to.”Now, however, he has his own flat – after being helped by the charity St Mungo’s. “I was lucky,” he said. “It takes most people about four years, if at all. We definitely need more social homes built. They want to move you on from the hostels but they can’t.”Cherelle, 30, explained how she was evicted from her housing association home for falling into rent arrears while she was sectioned, and lived in a cupboard at a housing block before being forced to move on.“There was no safety net, being mentally ill and addicted to drugs, it’s a double-edged sword,” she said. “You’re always fighting a battle. You’ve got to be at rock bottom before someone says here’s a hand. Rather than being able to ask for help before you get to that point.”She is now living in one of the St Mungo’s accommodation centres, along with many others of those at the event – none of whom is still sleeping rough. However, some have had to move to other boroughs away from their support networks to get a roof over their head.Almost 9,000 people were seen sleeping rough in London by outreach workers last year, more than double the number in 2010-11, according to the mayor’s office.Rough sleeping has also more than doubled across England and Wales over the last decade, and there is growing public concern. Churches, libraries and other buildings in Bradford, Newcastle upon Tyne, Derry and elsewhere were opened on Tuesday to provide Christmas dinners for homeless people.Next to the River Thames at City Hall, while people watched the seasonal film Elf and played Jenga, Khan called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to work with him to end rough sleeping.“I don’t pretend today is going to solve all these problems, it’s about giving some vulnerable Londoners a special experience at this time of year to raise awareness about these issues, and to give people hope that we can end rough sleeping once and for all,” he told the .The mayor said he has persuaded councils to provide shelter to all rough sleepers when temperatures approach zero in any borough in London.Downing Street has announced an extra £63m in funds to help tackle homelessness, but Labour said it was “too little, too late”. Khan blamed a lack of social housing, an unfit-for-purpose private rental market and social care cuts as well as the “disastrous” universal credit system for helping to drive increased homelessness.“I say merry Christmas to Boris Johnson, congratulations on the general election victory, but let’s work together to solve this,” he said. “I think we are judged as a society by how we treat the most vulnerable and we’re letting them down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4854cdfc778f51425b8066a389586ee66590d9d/0_158_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4cd8522cc37ec5f54c37129691c2e8b","title":"ben stokes father in critical condition in johannesburg england cricket south africa","story":"England’s preparations for the Test series continue to be nightmarish. The grimmest news came on Christmas Eve when it was announced that Ben Stokes’s father, in Johannesburg to watch the Test on Boxing Day, was in “a critical condition” in hospital. Later in the day it transpired that Chris Woakes had become another victim of the flu epidemic that has plagued the tour party.Joe Root could not add any more detail to the ECB’s press release about Stokes’s father, Ged, which referred to “a serious illness”. The captain stressed that “everyone should respect the privacy of Stokes and his family” and he added that it was “crucial” for the squad to support them all – his mother, brother and wife are also in Johannesburg.“That comes first‚” said Root. “It puts things in perspective. We’re here to play good, hard cricket and to win this series but most importantly we want to make sure Ben and his family get all the support they can get,” and that is what the tour party have been doing.Root then revealed that Woakes was experiencing what appears to be the initial stages of the flu bug that has already afflicted four of the squad: Jofra Archer, Jack Leach, Stuart Broad and, more mildly, Joe Denly. Woakes did not train on Christmas Eve and nor did Stokes, who was at his father’s bedside, but the three bowlers who are returning from illness, did.Root did his best to stay sanguine about the situation. “We have got extra people here and it’s a good squad that enables us to put out a competitive team come what may. It’s frustrating but we have to handle it. The most important thing is that we give Ben and his family all the support we can.”Despite South Africa’s recent record – five Test defeats in succession – and the recent issues about the running of their game Root expects tough opposition on Boxing Day. “I have never encountered a South African team that does not play with pride and passion. And I expect nothing different at Centurion. They are good in their own conditions,” Root said.There are so many complications about the fitness and availability of so many players that England will delay the announcement of their team until the morning of the match. The vast majority of the 19 cricketers here have a chance of playing. Among the options is the possibility of going into the Test without a specialist spinner for the second game in a row – partly because Jack Leach still has to prove his fitness.Moreover, if Stokes does not play - a decision he would take with the utmost reluctance – there is the chance that Jonny Bairstow might fill the number five slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51e4a33f0632be9b6ed92d11f13f971bd040352a/52_163_2452_1471/master/2452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ad17596a37904971fd322bbb36b775f","title":"the spin test team of the decade cricket","story":"Three Englishmen, three Australians, two from India and South Africa and one from New Zealand make a formidable XIThe 2010s end, like they began, with India top of the world rankings and in between 598 players, from Varun Aaron to Zulqarnain Haider, have played 431 Tests in 171 series. Here is our Test team of the decade, picked by a panel of 10  journalists: Vic Marks, Ali Martin, Rob Smyth, Tim de Lisle, Emma John, Tanya Aldred, Geoff Lemon, Adam Collins, Jonathan Liew and Andy Bull.England’s rock. Cook played more innings, faced more balls and scored more runs in Test cricket than anyone this decade. If you sat down to watch every last little bit of his batting it would take 18 days of 247 viewing. But even more than that, in an era when teams found it harder than ever to win away from home, Cook was the key player in England’s greatest series victories, in Australia 2010‑11, when he made 766 runs, and in India 2012-13, when he made 562. By then, inevitably, he had been made England captain, a job that taxed his bottomless reserves of strength, stamina and endurance.The Oscar Madison of our odd couple of openers. If Cook was one of the last of the old breed of Test match batsmen, Warner was one of the first of the new. He had hardly played 10 first-class games but more than 100 T20 matches when he made his Test debut. It didn’t matter. He carried his bat for 123 in his second Test. Since then, well … it has been complicated. Some of the judges explicitly ruled him out on the grounds that they still hadn’t forgiven him for his role in the ball-tampering scandal at Cape Town, but more reckoned the ups outnumbered the downs.Our captain, on the grounds that he has managed to wring so much out of such modest resources (he has taken his team to second in the world rankings this year) and for the way he and his side carried themselves in the minutes after the World Cup final. He began the decade by scoring a century on debut, against India in Ahmedabad. Before long people were saying he might become New Zealand’s greatest batsman, and before long he had. Williamson has scored hundreds against every team, in all sorts of conditions, on every continent, in every country except one, and he has done it without sending so much as a single tweet.The very model of a modern cricketer and the most influential player in the world. A man of boundless ambition, he doesn’t just lead India by example, but epitome. Before Kohli, India had four great Test batsmen and it sometimes feels as though he stole the best and brightest bits of each of them – Sourav Ganguly’s fire, Sachin Tendulkar’s dedication, Virender Sehwag’s swagger, VVS Laxman’s grace – and bound them all together into something stronger, fiercer, less forgiving. Under Kohli, India have become one of the fittest, sharpest and most hostile sides around. So long as they have him, India will never be underdogs again. The cricketer of the decade.It is an old story, but worth repeating. Like Williamson, Smith made his Test debut back in 2010, only he was batting No 9 in the second innings, and bowling his pug-ugly leg-spin. Ten years later he has transformed himself into the greatest Test batsman of his age, a man who, at his best, people will readily compare to Don Bradman without blushing. By the tail-end of the decade, old bowlers around the world were still telling themselves, and everyone else, that they knew how to get around his Heath Robinson technique. His contemporaries had given up kidding themselves.In the 16 years he has been playing he has shown he can do pretty much anything he turns his mind to. Here he is in as wicketkeeper, a job he did, on and off, in the first half of the decade. He gave it up because he said it was all too much, but, curiously, he was a better batsman when he was doubling up. His batting average as a wicketkeeper this decade is just under 60, which (ridiculously) is half as good again as anyone else. He seems to be so gifted that his own boredom with it all is the only thing that can get the better of him.The old measure of what makes an all-rounder, stacking up averages, doesn’t really work for Stokes, you do not measure him in numbers but moments, matches and memories. He is a human highlights reel, from his defiant 120 at the Waca, England’s one century in a whitewash, through his rollocking 258 at Cape Town, to that 135 at Headingley, from his miraculous ing catch to dismiss Adam Voges at Trent Bridge to his marathon spells, the swing, the short balls. This team could really do with a second spinner in this position, but no one is going to begrudge his inclusion.A tricky pick this one between Ashwin, Nathan Lyon and Rangana Herath. Ashwin’s wickets have come a little cheaper, and more frequently, than either of his rivals and if he has struggled to figure out how to bowl in Australia and South Africa, his wickets have been one of the key factors in India’s remarkable run at home, where they have lost one series out of 19. Ashwin has pushed spin bowling on too, has developed his own style which isn’t exactly orthodox, but doesn’t depend on the doosra, either. Which is why, unlike his rivals, he has succeeded in all three formats.The one wide-open spot in the XI, Johnson won it because of the number of traumatised England fans among the selectors. Much as they would like to try and forget it, Johnson will always be remembered for 37 wickets he took in the 2013-14 Ashes, when he single-handedly dismantled a team who were sure they had what it took to win there. It was one of the most unremittingly hostile performances by any fast bowler, too quick and too sharp for some of the best batsmen of the era. By the time he was done with them, England were in disarray.The finest fast bowler of his generation. It is strange to remember, now, that around the beginning of the decade everyone was worried about the decline of fast bowling. Steyn was the exception all along, the one man who, all through those barren years, stood comparison with greatest quicks of the 1980s and 1990s. Steyn has ripped through every team at one time or another and he has taken five cheap wickets in an innings against every side he has played against. It was only at the end of the decade, when injuries finally began to catch up with him, that his form fell away.The only player in the XI who was playing Test cricket before the decade started and will still be playing it after it is finished. Anderson has done it by transforming himself from a real daisy of an English swinger (some days he does, some days he doesn’t) into a man who has the tricks and skills, knowledge and understanding to succeed everywhere he plays. He has taken his wickets in Australia, India, Sri Lanka and in England, where batsmen grope after him like little kids trying to find the lady under the cups. He is as good as unplayable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d321ca9e45a7e137d3b181ad529aa111123cfc33/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f5d37ce43e67103963d9ab4f76e872f","title":"talking horses cyrname and kemboy the big names in racings festive feast","story":"From the outskirts of London to Ireland, Wales and then Cheltenham, racing has lots to look forward to this ChristmasIf you’re about to overdo yourself in appalling fashion at the dining table, the healthiest way to work it all off may be to chase along to Sunbury on Boxing Day for a little light exercise. The circuit from paddock to bookmakers to grandstand is bound to do some good, if repeated at half-hourly intervals, and there will be thrilling action on the track to lend renewed vigour to your circulation.It’s a small field for this year’s King George VI Chase but the six runners are full of quality and provide a nice blend of established talent and youthful promise. At the top of the betting, there is Cyrname (“The Only Horse To Beat Altior”) and Lostintranslation (“The Only Horse To Beat Bristol De Mai At Haydock”).If you still believe in last year’s winner, Clan Des Obeaux, the bookmakers will let you have 9-2 about his chances. Or perhaps you’re hoping for even more of a Christmas miracle with Thistlecrack, runner-up last year and the old man of the party at 11 years. According to his trainer, the fire still burns bright.Also on Boxing Day is the Christmas Hurdle, which features an unusually big field as a bunch of optimists try to take advantage of the absence of the injured Buveur D’Air. Three of his stablemates are at the top of the betting, so it seems Nicky Henderson has no more clue about who’s going to win than we do...If you make it to Kempton on the day after Boxing Day, Henderson is expected to be the key man then as well. His Altior is currently 2-5 for the Desert Orchid Chase, which would mark a significant return to two miles for the horse, whose step up in distance did not go so well at Ascot last month.Four days of top-class racing south of Dublin will provide fans of the jumps with much of their festive entertainment. It is also sure to be essential viewing for anyone in need of clues for the Cheltenham Festival. You probably think that’s a long way off but some serious contenders may be about to have their final outing before lining up in Gloucestershire three months hence.Saturday’s Savills Chase is the feature, when Kemboy is sure to be a strong favourite. This is a belated return to action for the horse whose ownership has been the centre of prolonged controversy. He is now allowed to race in new colours and, while the consequences of that story have yet to fully unravel, it is clearly excellent news that such a bright young talent can compete once more.Surprisingly, Willie Mullins has indicated he may also run Al Boum Photo, the Gold Cup winner, as the Leopardstown ground is expected to suit. A clash between the pair, first and second in the Punchestown Gold Cup in May, would be worth going a long way to see.Mullins is also expected to run the very classy two-miler Chacun Pour Soi at Leopardstown on Friday, while Sunday’s action could feature the likes of Klassical Dream and Envoi Allen, both Festival winners last spring.Away from Leopardstown, do not miss Limerick’s Matchbook Novice Chase on Boxing Day  St Stephen’s Day, in which Faugheen takes on Samcro.Settling down with a crossword puzzle or a murder mystery is reckoned to be a fine way of clearing the head over the holidays, but more challenging than any Agatha Christie is the question of who is going to win the Welsh Grand National. Or at least the bookmakers are hoping that this big-field handicap is as difficult as it usually has been.Punters may feel differently, as the obvious favourite is Elegant Escape, who delivered the goods in last year’s race. From the Dorset yard of Colin Tizzard, also well represented in the King George the day before, this classy sort is still only seven and no bigger than 7-2 to become the first back-to-back winner since Bonanza Boy some 30 years ago.Tizzard may yet take on his own favourite with West Approach and if so there will be some sentimental types hoping for an extremely rare Christmas double West Approach is a half-brother to Thistlecrack, an outsider in the King George.While most of the runners will be English-trained, Potters Corner and Pobbles Bay should provide a lively home defence, while Big River is expected to tilt at the prize for the Scottish trainer Lucinda Russell.Racing’s way of clearing its head on New Year’s Day is to head to the natural home of jump racing for seven quality contests that offer many a clue to the Festival, though a start time of 12.15pm is less than ideal if you were up late the night before. It is just possible that some of those present will have remained a stranger to their beds for the previous 24 hours, which is unlikely to improve their decision-making…The highlight is the Dipper Novice Chase, with a very classy roll of honour, featuring recent winners like Yanworth, Whisper and Oscar Whisky. Lostintranslation outgunned Defi Du Seuil a year ago, a piece of form that is working out very nicely.Add in the usual assortment of challenging Cheltenham handicaps, plus the track’s reliably convivial atmosphere, and you have the makings of a 1st of January that should be much better than most of the days that follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2e4e20ed6a962133988fe9f560b03bac5812059/0_18_3272_1964/master/3272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8ab58c074015b9c37bf87a640ee1fb9","title":"uber co founder travis kalanick to resign from board of directors","story":"Uber’s former CEO Travis Kalanick will resign from the board of directors of the US ride-share giant by the end of the year, the company said on Tuesday, effectively severing ties with the outfit he co-founded a decade ago.Kalanick, who helped found Uber in 2009, stepped down from the company’s helm in June 2017 under pressure from investors, after a string of setbacks.Kalanick’s pugnacious style turned Uber into the world’s largest ride-services company that revolutionized the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide.“Very few entrepreneurs have built something as profound as Travis Kalanick did with Uber.

While she hasn’t achieved everything she set out to do – far from it – allies and rivals agree that Ocasio-Cortez has upended Democratic politics, pushing the party inexorably to the left. And all before her 30th birthday, which she celebrated in October.“Her presence in Congress has been seismic,” said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a progressive political organization that recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run for office. “She has changed the whole ecosystem and expanded the idea of what’s possible in the minds of voters. That kind of change is on a scale that’s almost immeasurable.”Few knew her name before the evening of 26 June 2018, when she stunned the political establishment – and herself – by soundly defeating Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent and the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. Now she’s known universally by her initials: AOC.In the year since her arrival on Capitol Hill, Ocasio-Cortez has convinced every major 2020 presidential candidate to support her Green New Deal, galvanized opposition to a deal with Amazon in New York and turned a tedious congressional hearing on money in politics into must-see TV. Last cycle, she raised more money than any other House Democrat, including Pelosi. And across the country, waves of Democratic insurgents are challenging long-serving incumbents in what has been called the “AOC effect”.“She’s gotten a lot done by challenging the status quo – by taking on politics as usual in Washington,” said Caroline Fredrickson, the president emerita of the American Constitution Society and author of the upcoming book The AOC Way.Fredrickson says Ocasio-Cortez has defied long-standing expectations about how young women, and especially women of color, behave in the corridors of power. At the same time she’s surprised critics who once dismissed her as merely a “bright and shiny new object”.“A lot of people expected a show pony. But it turns out she’s a workhorse,” Fredrickson said, pointing to her skillful questioning of witnesses during congressional hearings.Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t mind being underestimated. (“That’s how I won my primary,” she quipped on CNN.)But the congresswoman has said the heavy workload and constant scrutiny can take a toll.Her playful repartee on social media, mixing the personal with the political, has helped her build a loyal following far beyond her New York district, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens.Ocasio-Cortez has emerged as a symbol of a Democratic party that is younger, more erse and increasingly wary of the excesses of capitalism. She believes voters are tired of pragmatism and consensus-building. Her campaign resonated, she argues, because of her uncompromising clarity of vision. It’s a contested theory of change that she shares with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whom she endorsed in October.“If you’re a one-term Congress member, so what?” Ocasio-Cortez said in a video produced by Justice Democrats earlier this year. “You can make 10 years’ worth of change in one term if you’re not afraid.”She stridently, and often wittily, counters internet trolls. She made huge waves on a visit to the migrant detention facilities at the US-Mexico border in July 2019, and helped expose appalling conditions for adults, children and even babies there.A political and cultural icon on the progressive left, she has also transfixed the right: Fox News covers her religiously while Trump and Republicans have eagerly promoted her as the face of the Democratic party. Trump has labeled her a “communist” and a “nightmare for America”. He has also said that she and three other liberal congresswomen of color who form a group that Ocasio-Cortez named “the Squad” – Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – should “go back” to their countries. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, not far from the Trump family home in Queens.Ocasio-Cortez was raised in a working-class family: her father owned a small business as an architect and her mother, who was born in Puerto Rico, cleaned houses. She studied international relations and economics at Boston University.When she was a sophomore in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, her father died of lung cancer and plunged the family into economic hardship. She has said that this ordeal helped shape her views on healthcare and economic reform.“When you’re from a working class background it often feels like you’re just one disaster away from everything falling apart,” she said in an emotional Instagram story titled You can do it pinned to the top of her feed. “And that’s kind of what happened when my dad died.”Her lightning-strike rise from bartender to Democratic dragonslayer to member of Congress – all in the  of little more than a year – has not been an entirely smooth transition.In February, her office botched the rollout of the Green New Deal by distributing an incorrect fact sheet about the proposal that lead to widespread confusion over key details of the plan and lent itself to parody by Republicans. In New York she faced criticism for being slow to open a district office (she now has two). And she stirred fierce backlash when she described migrant detention camps at the border as “concentration camps” – a term she has stood by.“Nobody expects to go from not having health insurance to being on the front page of every major newspaper, literally overnight,” Rojas said.Many Democrats have griped privately about her outsized celebrity and combative politics, which they fear imperils vulnerable House members running for re-election in conservative districts where her brand is toxic. In the early days of her tenure, she alienated others in the party by aligning with a movement that runs primary challenges against moderate and right-leaning Democrats. Though she has denied reports that a top target was Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, she has endorsed challengers in two prominent House primaries.Those tensions exploded in spectacular fashion this summer after the House passed a border-funding bill that enraged progressives. On Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez’s then chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti unloaded on moderates who voted for the legislation, referring to them as the “New Southern Democrats” and accusing them of enabling “a racist system”. He has since left her office.Pelosi escalated the row when she told the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd in an interview that the four members of the Squad had “their public whatever and their Twitter world” but they “didn’t have any following”.It was not the first time Pelosi has dismissed the left’s influence – she once referred to the Green New Deal as the “green dream” – but this remark drew an unsparing response. Ocasio-Cortez retorted that the ability to shift public sentiment was proof of her power, and later said that Pelosi was “singling out ... newly elected women of color”. This infuriated allies of Pelosi, especially members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who said Ocasio-Cortez had gone too far.The dispute ultimately ended with a private, one-on-one meeting between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez to “clear the air”.Though deep rifts remain, the bitter infighting has largely subsided in the three months leading up to the House’s impeachment of Trump. In a recent tweet, Trump accused Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of the party of being so obsessed with his impeachment that they have failed to deliver on their legislative agenda.“In my first 11 months I’ve cosponsored 339 pieces of legislation, authored 15, took on Big Pharma w my colleagues in hearings that brought PreP generic a year early \u0026amp exposed abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez shot back.“In 4 years, you’ve jailed kids \u0026amp made corruption the cause celebré,” she added. “Try to keep up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b73555ca9332d0d13b01b3478a9a58b6e5b541/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93938dd41d4f0fcb1125b8934ace81f0","title":"thousands flee north west syria amid airstrikes","story":" Up to 30,000 leave area of Idlib province as government forces push to reopen road from Damascus to AleppoA mass exodus of civilians from the last rebel-held stronghold in Syria has begun as thousands of people flee towards the Turkish border in the face of a fierce new military assault by Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies.As many as 30,000 people have left the area around the town of Maarat al-Numan after four days of airstrikes and heavy shelling paved the way for Syrian government troops to push deeper into north-western Idlib province.Maarat al-Numan sits on the strategic M5 highway, which Assad is determined to capture in order to reopen the route linking the capital, Damascus, with the city of Aleppo, Syria’s largest.Military activity over the last few days has meant the road – the major escape route for civilians fleeing north – has also become a hazardous option. Attacks continued on Tuesday despite a supposed humanitarian pause in fighting.Those who can afford fuel have been fleeing in cars, motorbikes and flatbed trucks, often taking no more than what they can carry.“The warplanes were targeting the M5 with missiles and heavy machine guns the whole way. I don’t know how we made it alive, we are so lucky,” said Ammar Karkas, 29, a father of two who left Maarat al-Numan on Monday.“Two cars carrying displaced people just 2km behind us were targeted and five people were burnt alive. If we’d been a little bit later we would have been killed in the same airstrike.”Monitors and witnesses said at least 12 civilians have been killed on the road this week as Russian and Syrian air force jets have targeted civilian convoys.The new fighting comes despite a September agreement by the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran to recommit to de-escalation efforts in the area.At least 100 people have been killed since the ground offensive began last week, including five children who died after missiles hit a school sheltering displaced people in the village of Jobas on Tuesday.Maarat al-Numan, an important early centre of Syria’s 2011 revolution, now resembles a ghost town, resident Rami al-Maari said. The town is expected to fall to the regime imminently.“Last night in my neighbourhood an airstrike destroyed 20 houses. The shelling is continuous. They want to kill civilians or force them to leave,” the 23-year-old said.“My family don’t want to leave our house to go live in terrible conditions in a camp on the border. But if the soldiers get any closer we will have to leave because we are wanted by the regime and we are afraid of being arrested. In both scenarios we are dead.”A bombing campaign since April has killed more than 1,400 people and sent almost 1 million fleeing to the Turkish border. Thousands are now struggling in makeshift accommodation in the winter conditions as fuel shortages threaten medical care and push up prices of food and transport.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said the border will remain shut, warning that his country, already home to 4 million Syrians, will not be able to absorb new refugees.Aid agencies have repeatedly warned that attacking Idlib puts the lives of 3 million civilians in danger and could trigger the worst humanitarian disaster of the almost nine-year war to date. Originally home to about 1 million people, the province’s population has been swollen with civilians displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country.A ceasefire deal brokered by Russia and Turkey last year unravelled after the hardline Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) wrested control of the area from more moderate rebel groups in January.In the new, wide ground offensive, the regime has quickly advanced from the south and east towards Maarat al-Numan, capturing more than 40 villages and hamlets, sources on both sides said.Syrian government forces are now about 4km outside the town and have surrounded a Turkish observation post near the village of Surman – one of 12 installed last year as part of the ceasefire agreement.“The situation in Maaret al-Numan is indescribable: the city is witnessing the biggest mass displacement in this area since the beginning of the revolution,” said Mustafa al-Ghareebl, spokesperson for the town’s civil defence centre.“We are working around the clock rescuing civilians trapped under the debris, but also helping move people out of the city. We’ve appealed to people who own cars or vans in neighbouring areas to come help move civilians fleeing the bombing. There are still hundreds of families at risk.”The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has expressed alarm at the escalation in fighting, which adds to threats to vital cross-border aid to Idlib after the security council was unable to overcome Russian and Chinese objections to an existing aid delivery programme in a vote last week.“The UN urges all parties to ensure the protection of civilians, and to allow sustained and unhindered access by all humanitarian parties to provide life-saving assistance to all in need,” said Stéphane Dujarric, Guterres’s spokesman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aef6ce6410febd08f63a7e4b1120761e623f3c9/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a58aecc2d38aba3edb0d1ded93da837","title":"notre dame cathedral cancels christmas mass for first time in 200 years","story":"French Catholics worship at nearby church in Paris following fire at cathedral in AprilNotre Dame Cathedral was unable to hold Christmas Eve mass for the first time in more than 200 years after a fire ravaged its structure in April.French Catholics instead gathered at the church of Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois, a few hundred metres away from the Paris landmark, for a service celebrated by the cathedral’s rector Patrick Chauvet.“It isn’t the same feeling but it’s still a Christmas mass,” said 16-year-old Juliette, who had made the 700km (435 miles) trip from Aix-en-Provence with her family. “There will be a thought for Notre Dame tonight, that’s for sure.”“We have been crying since 15 April, and today even more,” said Danielle, a Parisian, who attended last year’s mass. She said she felt lifted by the choir of Notre Dame, who performed at the mass.Meanwhile, workers continue to repair and rebuild the cherished cathedral.Notre Dame, part of a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the River Seine, lost its gothic spire, roof and many precious artefacts in the fire, which was watched by huge crowds.The building had remained open for Christmas through two centuries – including the Nazi occupation in the second world war – being forced to close only during the anti-Catholic revolutionary period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has set a timetable of five years to completely repair the 800-year-old building, which remains shrouded in scaffolding with a vast crane looming over it.Paris prosecutors suspect criminal negligence and opened an investigation in June, suggesting a stray cigarette butt or an electrical fault could be the culprit.The culture ministry said in October that nearly €1bn (£856m) had been pledged or raised for the reconstruction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc63b24d8533e7f008a24a691f667b1e50b1f03/0_134_3274_1965/master/3274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d65305e7fd098e17336cdc5f1e3cdb","title":"philippines typhoon brings christmas day misery","story":"People stranded in evacuation centres and at ports as Typhoon Phanfone passes over string of islandsTyphoon Phanfone has pummelled the central Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet and miserable holiday season to millions.

More than 10,000 people spent the night in schools, gyms and government buildings hastily converted into evacuation centres as the typhoon made landfall on Tuesday, civil defence officials said.“It was frightening.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Temporary emergency marquees for Brexit checks which never happened have been put up and taken down a number of times over the last year at Rosslare Europort at a cost of more than €120,000.The  has learned that tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario, as permanent infrastructure has not yet been built.The marquees were originally intended to be installed to cover the ramifications of a potential no-deal scenario in March. They were first put up in anticipation of the March and April 2019 deadlines, and remained in place until June 11th.They were then dismantled as the OPW had no use for them ahead of a new Brexit deadline in October.They were then reinstalled on the October 21st, 2019 in preparation for the October 31st deadline.“They are likely to remain on site until the threat of a no deal passes, or if any changes are indicated following the British elections. On completion of the final phase of development of the new border control post on the site, expected by the end of January 2020, the marquees will be dismantled and returned,” a spokesman for the OPW said.According to the Government’s Brexit Contingency Plan, published in July 2019, infrastructure at ports was due to be “refined” and “improved” after the first deadline passed in March.It said that “permanent state inspection facilities will be constructed on a site adjacent to the existing port”.“This facility will accommodate inspection bays for SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) and food safety checks as well as a number of Revenue turnout sheds. The site will also include office accommodation, a documentary and public office, driver welfare facilities, two documentary and identity check facilities” and parking for 35 HGVs, the contingency plan states.Permanent infrastructureIn response to queries about the cost of the tents, a spokesman for the OPW said that “interim infrastructure was put in place at Rosslare Europort to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit on 29 March 2019. In the period afforded by subsequent Brexit extensions, this has been enhanced incrementally since then. Permanent infrastructure will be put in place to apply the additional customs, SPS and health checks and controls on a long-term basis”.The OPW said the marquees had a “dual purpose for department staff training requirements and for use as emergency inspection accommodation for use in case of a no-deal Brexit”.The agency says it has already paid €110,400, excluding VAT, for the hire of the marquees with an indicative monthly rate of €27,600, excluding VAT.“The cost of their dismantling, removal from site and reinstallation in October 2019 was €8,500. We were not charged while the marquees were off-site.”A source has told The  that a large fence was also installed and removed at the site. The OPW said the costs for this are not available at this time.“The purpose of the moveable fencing was for site ision and security. Portions of the site were handed over to the client departments for training purposes as they became available. The moveable fencing is necessary to enable our main contractor to proceed with construction works safely, in parallel with department staff training and movements adjacent.“Given the area in question is an active construction site, moveable fencing is in place for the duration of the works for the safety and security of all parties.“The costs for fencing are incorporated into the main contract for the building of the border control post and will be available once the works are complete.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe chances of the Government surviving until after Easter have risen after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar indicated he may accept an offer from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin for a short programme of government in 2020.The Taoiseach responded by email just before 6pm on Monday evening to a letter sent to him by Mr Martin earlier this month suggesting a short legislative programme between January and April next.It is understood the Taoiseach said Fine Gael was not in favour of the coalition winding down early.Both leaders have now agreed to meet face-to-face in early January to see if agreement can be reached for a programme that would take the Government up to the Easter break.If agreement is reached, it will essentially rule out a February election and make the end of April or the beginning of May a more likely date for a general election.Mr Martin wrote to Mr Varadkar almost two weeks ago arguing that the sensible and logical option would be for the 32nd Dáil to continue until the end of the spring term, which would bring it to Holy Thursday, April 9th 2020.He suggested a short and “doable” programme of Bills that could be passed by the Oireachtas in that period.In his response on Monday night, Mr Varadkar made a pointed reference to a letter he sent to Mr Martin in August 2018, seeking an extension of the confidence and supply arrangement. Mr Martin never responded to the letter but later agreed to a year-long extension. The Taoiseach, in his response on Monday, suggested an agreement at that time could have dealt with the situation which now existed, where there was no programme.However, it is understood Mr Varadkar went on to say he did not have a major problem with any of the Bills suggested by Mr Martin, and also suggested a number of Bills emanating from Government as other possibilities.Meanwhile, former Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy said on Monday evening he would cooperate with any Oireachtas inquiry into his attendance record.“It remains my intention to establish that I have not broken any rules with respect to my attendance or related expenses paid to me during me time as a TD and vice president and campaign director of the EPP (European People’s Party). I believe it will be possible to find an independent person or process to facilitate this ,” he said in a statement.“Secondly I would like to reiterate and clarify that I have had, from the very beginning of my time in the role of leading the campaign for Europe’s largest political grouping, the full and unqualified support of Fine Gael.“I am also happy to provide evidence of this to the agreed appropriate body. I will contact the Ceann Comhairle and Clerk of the Dáil to see how best to progress this very early in the new year.”In his email to Mr Martin on Monday, Mr Varadkar is understood to have referred to the precarious Dáil arithmetic now faced by the Fine Gael and Independent Alliance coalition. With the resignation of Mr Murphy, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have the same number of TDs at 46.Mr Varadkar did not refer to John McGuinness by name but indicated there was concern that a Fianna Fáil TD might vote against the coalition in a confidence motion. In the email, Mr Varadkar sought reassurance from Fianna Fáil that it would have a contingency plan in place to allow the Government continue should Mr McGuinness not obey the Fianna Fáíl whip.Among the Bills suggested by Mr Martin was a Bill on electoral and digital transparency drafted by James Lawless, a Bill extending over 70s medical card eligibility, and a Bill on the exploitation of children by drug gangs and people smugglers."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Senior member of Shinzo Abe\u0026#39s Liberal Democratic Party arrested over casino bribery allegationsWill this year’s Queen’s Speech be ‘Annus Horribilis 2’?The Queen\u0026#39s Christmas message is the one time of year she uses a professional make-up artist, dresser revealsAndrew Miller: Tributes to \u0026#39warmth and kindness\u0026#39 of former Labour MP who has died aged 70Duchess of Cambridge posts new photograph of her family on Instagram with Christmas message to followersJihadists on motorbikes kill 35 civilians in Burkina Faso raidColorado man robs bank and throws money to passers-by while shouting \u0026#39Merry Christmas\u0026#39, say witnessesArchbishop of Canterbury to reflect on London Bridge terror attack in Christmas Day sermonMichael Bloomberg admits campaign used prison labour to make phone callsPolice spend thousands on electric cars that can\u0026#39t be used for emergencies, reports revealBath bans coaches, over complaints day-trippers only bring pollutionFamilies could miss out on Christmas present after delivery depot ransacked by thieves  Spanish winemakers move to higher ground to escape rising temperaturesThree members of British family die \u0026#39after drowning in swimming pool\u0026#39 at their Spanish hotelDonkey was ideal choice to carry the Messiah to Bethlehem, say scientistsHuawei could steal people\u0026#39s \u0026#39intimate\u0026#39 data if UK gives it full access to 5G networks, top US official warnsUniqlo heads towards full warehouse automation with groundbreaking robot that can fold and box clothesGermany rejects EU calls to accept children from Greek migrant campsDan Jarvis hints he could run to be Labour leader as he says party must learn to listen to the peopleWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/23/TELEMMGLPICT000219548175_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVnGZDHLVbaDWtLqzwQh5-XkyztDRjf0dUW_myY0VgWI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"iraqs chaldean christians cancel public christmas celebrations","story":"Iraqis walk past a decorated Christmas tree in Baghdad\u0026#39s Karrada districtThe towering Christmas tree in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square had always been a wondrous sight.

The machine allowed people to exchange bitcoins for cash58 The fall of MtGoxThe world\u0027s biggest bitcoin exchange, MtGox, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after losing almost 750,000 of its customers bitcoins. At the time, this was around 7 per cent of all bitcoins and the market inevitably crashed68 Would the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand upIn 2015, Australian police raided the home of Craig Wright after the entrepreneur claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto. He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe research builds on previous studies that uncovered a correlation between bitcoin\u0027s price and Google searches relating to cryptocurrency.However, the most recent data we\u0027ve analysed here show Google searches for \u0027bitcoin\u0027 peaking before holidays, not after.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes.

In exchange for a payment, whether in cash, supplies or services, a TV show or a film would prominently display a brand-name product.Then there was virtual product placement. Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film. When he is in the hanger on the runway it is N3035C, but once it’s flying, the numbers change to N3413F.829 The Wizard of Oz (1939)Judy Garland isn’t wearing her iconic ruby red slippers in the scene where the trees pelt Dorothy and the Scarecrow with apples.

In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”.

Didn’t anybody notice when they edited it?1229  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)We were always told that Harry Potter had his mother’s blue eyes. But when we see Lily Potter as a child, she has brown eyes. As a group of stormtroopers enter a control room, one of them accidentally bangs his head on a door. The actor responsible, Laurie Good, couldn’t believe it made it into the final film.  1429 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)There is a crew member wearing a cowboy hat and looking out to sea behind Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow on the pirate ship. 1529 Quantum of Solace (2008)A street cleaner behind Daniel Craig’s James Bond is pretending to sweep the road but is holding his broom several inches off the ground.1629 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)When Bianca accidentally shoots a gym teacher with an arrow, an extra, who is playing a student, runs off to get urgent help – but once she thinks she is out of shot, she stops and looks back at the camera.There is a modern car in the background of a big battle scene. Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky.

But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.The Tim Burton-directed superhero film has multiple mistakes, but a major one happens in the scene when Joker and his crew deface paintings at a museum. One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film.

In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”. Clearly, a set designer left it there by mistake.1129 The Fast and the Furious (2001)In a scene when Jesse and Tran race, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the next shot he’s in a tank top. Didn’t anybody notice when they edited it?1229  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)We were always told that Harry Potter had his mother’s blue eyes. But when we see Lily Potter as a child, she has brown eyes. As a group of stormtroopers enter a control room, one of them accidentally bangs his head on a door. The actor responsible, Laurie Good, couldn’t believe it made it into the final film.  1429 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)There is a crew member wearing a cowboy hat and looking out to sea behind Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow on the pirate ship. 1529 Quantum of Solace (2008)A street cleaner behind Daniel Craig’s James Bond is pretending to sweep the road but is holding his broom several inches off the ground.1629 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)When Bianca accidentally shoots a gym teacher with an arrow, an extra, who is playing a student, runs off to get urgent help – but once she thinks she is out of shot, she stops and looks back at the camera.There is a modern car in the background of a big battle scene. Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error. Ridley Scott finally fixed this and other mistakes with his 2007 Final Cut.John Carpenter’s slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis was set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois, but all the cars have Californian number plates and there are shots of palm trees, as the film was shot in Southern California.At the end of the cult film, Data tells news reporters that the octopus was really scary, but this actually refers to a deleted scene. It was only added back in for the Disney Channel version.Eagle-eyed fans have noted that Ant-Man can be seen in two places at once during the final battle scene – in the van, and in his giant form, fighting alongside the other Avengers. 2529 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)Merry and Pippin are captured by the Orcs at the start of the film, and Pippin is seen in handcuffs. But he doesn’t have them anymore in the fight scene. And then they reappear on his wrists a few moments later.Ridley Scott’s epic film took place many centuries before fuel-powered vehicles.

But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell?

But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)While there’s no Agatha Christie drama this year, cries of “Bah humbug!” should quieten down when viewers see Guy Pearce, Andy Serkis, Stephen Graham and Charlotte Riley star in a unique take on Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. The new adaptation\u0026nbsppromises to be a “haunting, hallucinatory, spine-tingling immersion into Scrooge’s dark night of the soul”.\u0026nbspThe Christmas Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan, BBC2, 9pmRomesh Ranganathan is back with a Christmas special of his comedy travel show.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22.

The quote read: “Whoever fights monsters should see to it in the process he does not become a monster, and if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back at you.”Lewis continued: “What that means is, the more obsessed you become in hunting the monster, you almost become the monster. You become as ugly and obsessive as the monster himself.”He said it was an “extraordinary\u0026nbspmoment” for Thomson.“She realised, ‘Oh my God, my world has become so dark. I’ve inhabited this world of this kitten killer and murderer – this wannabe murderer – for so long, I’m beginning to think like him, I’m beginning to sort of feel like him.’”Despite the efforts of online detectives to alert the authorities of Magnotta’s animal abuse, no action was taken until he murdered and dismembered Chinese student Lin Jun, a killing he also shared online in a video.Viewers have expressed their horror at the show on social media.One\u0026nbsptweeted: “Do NOT\u0026nbspif you’re sensitive to animal abuse.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth.

Almost two thousand people will spend Christmas separated from their loved ones, as they remain indefinitely imprisoned in a detention centre.“Locking vulnerable people up with no idea of when they will be released is yet another part of the Conservative government’s toxic and hostile approach to immigration. It is time the Tories gained some humanity and stopped wasting tax payers money on ensuring people spend their Christmas languishing in cells.“The Liberal Democrats believe detention centres should only ever be a last resort. It’s time the Tories listened, introduced a 28-day limit on detention, and shut the majority of the UK’s detention centres.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But some inidual stories have also had the power to elicit what feels like a global response.Here are some of the wildest, most tragic, and most endearing stories of the last decade – the times when it felt impossible not to follow the story.No sooner had the decade begun than\u0026nbspEyjafjallajökull erupted – prompting travel chaos, an apocalyptic atmosphere and a pronunciation challenge for non-Icelandic newsreaders everywhere.Having laid dormant since 1823, the eruption, in the south of Iceland, saw ash shoot 30,000 feet into the air, creating a dark cloud that quite literally hung over Europe and caused the widest disruption to air travel since WWII.Over a period of six days, hundreds of locals were evacuated and tens of thousands of flights were cancelled.Created with Sketch.Best pictures of the decade Show all 72Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters flee from tear gas fired by riot police during clashes after protesters removed a concrete barrier at Qasr al-Aini Street near Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt on 24 JanuaryAmid tight security, members of the public arrive to pay their respects at the funeral of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Bernard \u0027Tignous\u0027 Verlhac at Pere Lachaise Cemetery on January 15  in Paris, France.

By the time the vessel arrived in Immingham, it was clear that this was the worst crisis in European aviation since the dark days following 911.The following days were characterised by stories of desperate travellers, growing frustration at what was increasingly seen as a gross overreaction, and various airlines failing to respect their obligations under European air passengers’ rights rules.”In the first but by no means the last enthralling cave disaster of the decade, 33 men became trapped for a staggering 69 days after a collapse at the copper and gold mine in which they worked.A true testament to the strength of the human spirit, the miners sent videos to the surface via a mini-camera, and were saidTheir eventual rescue, after two months, involved Nasa, and was watched by over a billion people worldwide, according to Chile’s state broadcaster - but it did take 23 hours.Mexican film-maker Patricia Riggen directed the 2016 film, The 33, and tells The Independent why the story spoke to her.“The idea of brotherhood was what drove me to tell this story. That is why I find these 33 men admirable.“And the world united in that moment to make this true miracle of humanity and technology and chance happen. It was the fact that they kept it together under the worst circumstances ever imagined, and helped each other, that they were able to stay alive.“And above ground people did the same, uniting forces, bringing everyone together: government, technology, resources, the love of the families, and the faith that they were still alive.“I love telling stories about the human spirit. About the best we have in ourselves. About humanity, which for me is the ability to rise to the circumstances and reach beyond ourselves for a greater good— to help a loved one, or a complete stranger. This is what makes life truly worth living. It’s what makes us humans. The Chilean miner’s story is one that we can all be proud of as humans.”Its modern image created largely in the shadow of the devastating twin atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan found itself victim to another nuclear crisis - this one triggered by the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake.That tremor and subsequent tsunami killed over 15,000 people and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant - displacing hundreds of thousands of people. This was a modern-day Chernobyl, in the internet era. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) which operated the plant, spent months denying a meltdown had occurred, and public mistrust remains high. In September of this year, the Japanese government announced it might have to soon release one million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea.Fukushima, four years on: inside the town the world forgotIn November 2011, eight months after the accident, journalists were, for the first time, allowed to visit the site.Writing for The New York Times, Martin Fackler wrote that:“About three dozen journalists sat on two buses. We wore protective suits, double gloves, double layers of clear plastic booties over shoes, hair covers, respirator masks, and carried radiation detectors. As we drove to the Fukushima plant, we passed through a police checkpoint, and saw three towns – Naraha, Tomioka, Okuma – empty of all inhabitants. Among the abandoned homes was a flower shop with plants, withered and dead, still on display.At the base of the reactor buildings, there were crumpled trucks, contorted metal girders and frames of buildings, a huge storage tank dented and bent, and pipes twisted by the forces of nature. The damage reached up to the second storey, attesting to the tsunami\u0027s 14-metre size. A four metre-high sea wall has been built with rocks in black nets. Tepco said it was a makeshift defence against another tsunami. The reading here was 300ms.The nuclear crisis minister, Goshi Hosono, came to address the men here. “Every time I come back, I feel conditions have improved,” he said. “This is due to your hard work.” He said he is aiming for a cold shutdown by the end of the year. All good news, then? Not quite. There are still 30 years of work after that, he said, referring to the dismantling of the reactors.”In what would become a defining moment of Barack Obama’s presidency, and after 10 years in hiding, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was located to a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Killed and buried at sea, the circumstances of his death were a foreshadow of the 2019 killing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - likely also to become one of Donald Trump’s key legacies.Sohaib Athar, a software expert, had recently moved to Abbottabad, in the eastern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, and inadvertently live-tweeted witnessing the May 2011 raid on bin Laden’s compound, conducted by Seal Team Six.He tells The Independent he has no regrets about tweeting that night.Crowds gather in US cities after Bin Laden killed“I was mostly amused - not by the raid of course, that was serious stuff - but by the irony of moving from Lahore to Abbottabad for some peace and quiet and landing in the middle of an international incident.“I don’t regret tweeting that night - it gave me a fresh perspective on how the multiple sides of a story are perceived by people from different parts of the world, and how easy it is for all sides involved to force a certain narrative on the world by a deliberate choice of words and cherry-picking.“I live in Islamabad now, but still have a tiny home in Abbottabad, and my coffee shop is still operational, so I visit every few months.“The media coverage that the incident received, and is still receiving, enforced an image of Pakistan that is reinforced at every \u0027anniversary\u0027. Pakistan is a mostly normal country if events are not sensationalised disproportionately. Abbottabad moved on a couple of weeks after the incident, the rest of the world still calls it news.”On 12 January, 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, on the Caribbean island of Hiiola.Already suffering from decades of political and economic turmoil - 70 per cent of the population was living under the poverty line at the time - the devastating tremor killed a quarter of a million people, and left a further 1.5 million living in makeshift camps.Naromie Marline Joseph Fatal, a psychological support worker with MSF in Haiti, tells The Independent about that day, and the months and years that followed.“I experienced the earthquake the same way that everyone else did, I was helpless. I thought that an atomic bomb had gone off, the noise was so loud.Huge toll feared in Haiti earthquake“I saw buildings and trees collapsing, one after another… and the hospital, a five-storey building, was trembling. I couldn’t go anywhere - I lay down on the floor and clenched my fists. God, help me!, I prayed.“In the days that followed, tractors picked up bodies as if they were rubbish. Four years later I spoke to a psychologist myself, to chase those images away.“After the earthquake… psychological support was needed on a massive scale. The level of need was huge – there were bereaved parents, depressed people, the shock of the deaths.“I began working full time with MSF, as they were the only organisation who were taking care of people with psychiatric needs. It needs to be said that what happened pushed people who were already fragile over the edge.“It was an event that touched all of humanity, 300,000 dead is unthinkable. International aid and media attention were particularly strong over the five years following the earthquake.“We’ve heard a lot of talk about reconstruction. Me, I haven’t seen it yet. We’re still waiting.For those who had seen Lost, the story seemed eerily familiar - so I’m told. Had the plane actually disappeared?But despite the best efforts of Malaysian authorities to insist the plane would be found, and all 227 passengers and 12 crew were still alive, it was soon clear this was either a tragic accident or mass murder.Again, Simon Calder reflects on this truly mysterious event.“Before 8 March 2014, aviation had a long history of planes disappearing mysteriously. But none was on the scale of MH370.The Malaysia Airlines jet had taken off from Kuala Lumpur on a routine flight to Beijing. The first the world knew that anything was wrong what when air-traffic controllers in Vietnam were unable to make contact with the Boeing 777. After some fictitious reports that it had landed in southern China with technical problems, MH370 was declared missing and presumed to have crashed in the South China Sea.The manifest showed there was 239 people on board (though some say there may have been at least one more, hiding in an under-floor bay before perpetrating an act of mass murder).For a week, rescuers conducted a fruitless search in the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam. Then, at a dramatic press conference in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, announced that the aircraft had remained aloft for hours after it disappeared. An analysis of automated signals by Inmarsat revealed the 777 must have flown along one of two arcs: northwest across southern China towards the Caspian Sea, or south across the Indian Ocean to an area west of Australia.The authorities concluded that the former was impossible without the plane being spotted, and Australia took control of the search operation. From an air force base north of Perth, reconnaissance flights begin of the presumed crash area. Plans were made for an unprecedented, and ultimately unsuccessful, sweep of the ocean floor. Fragments of the aircraft started washing up on Indian Ocean beaches – though analysis of the species of barnacles that had grown up on the aircraft’s “flaperon” failed to help locate the wreckage.One person very close to the saga believes the plane will be found in the southern Indian Ocean once undersea drone technology makes it feasible to deploy 100 or more unmanned devices to plumb the depths for signs of former life.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Women of the Decade, 2010-2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In September 2018, psychology professor Dr Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, when she was 15 years old.

He moved to the occupied West Bank to find work, as youth unemployment in Gaza soared to 70 per cent.\u0026nbspDiana has not seen her youngest daughter Sara since she began studying in Jordan two years ago. \u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn fact, for the last three years, Diana herself has been barred from crossing into Israel for regular cancer remission check-ups.Her eldest daughter, Elaine, 19, who sits beside her fiddling with a crucifix necklace, is also waiting. She is engaged to a Christian man, who lives in the West Bank.The young couple met online in 2018 but have only seen each other in the flesh once, in Jordan, when Elaine was allowed to attend a girl’s scouts event.Christmas and Easter are the few times a year Gaza’s dwindling Christian population can apply for permits to leave the 35-mile long enclave.The special permissions are supposed to allow the 1,000 or so of Gaza’s Christians to worship in Bethlehem or Jerusalem, to see family in other parts of the occupied Palestinian Territories, or to briefly travel abroad.But the overwhelming majority of families are never granted the papers to cross.Mid interview, one of the church officials breaks the news that only 192 of the 950 permits submitted have been approved. Diana and her daughter were not among the lucky few.“I’m 45 years old but my heart feels 90,” says the breast cancer survivor, struggling to put on a brave face.“Our family is separated because of the occupation, but what did we do to deserve this?”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we’re Christians. We don’t have weapons we don’t have any ties to any armed group.”Elaine, downcast, says she fears she will never be able to marry.“I feel awful all the time my fiance\u0026nbspand I can’t share moments together,” she says. “I just want to live with him. All we do is dream of permits.”Gaza has been closed off to the world since Israel and Egypt shuttered\u0026nbspthe borders after Hamas violently seized control of the Strip in 2007.It is geographically separated from the West Bank, where\u0026nbspBethlehem is, and so crossing from one area to the other requires hard-to-get permission from the Israelis, who\u0026nbspaccuse Hamas of abusing the permit system to plan attacks against its citizens.This year, the Israeli authorities have flip-flopped on the Christmas permits so much so that Christians told The Independent they felt like yo-yos.\u0026nbspThe Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat), the body that deals with the permissions, originally said in early December they would grant no holiday permits.At the weekend, 192 permissions were suddenly issued. However, families said many of them were random: a husband was approved but not the wife, or the children were approved but without the parents.Cogat then announced on Facebook late on Sunday it would consider all permits, pending security assessments “in recognition of the Christmas holiday”, but gave no further information.Diana is still not hopeful.“It\u0026nbspfeels like collective punishment. And it’s so random. Young children, sometimes babies, get permission but their mothers don’t,” she adds.Israeli rights groups say over the last few years it has become increasingly hard for all Gazans, whether Muslim\u0026nbspor Christian, to secure permission to leave the Strip. They say this is a deliberate move\u0026nbspby the Israeli authorities\u0026nbspto ide the Palestinian territories, thereby decreasing the chance of a future independent\u0026nbspstate.Miriam Marmur who works for Gisha, an Israeli NGO working on Palestinian freedom of movement, says this year the Israeli authorities have been particularly last minute with the Christmas papers, calling it “confusion by design”.“As we’ve seen recently, Israel is increasingly cracking down on movement between Gaza and West Bank as part of a policy of separation. The goals are political in nature,” she tells The Independent.“Israel is trying to minimise movement and freedoms using bureaucratic violence.”\u0026nbspCogat\u0026nbspalso tried to ban permits at Easter but eventually granted 300, Marmur continues.“It is definitely getting worse each year,” she adds.Back in Gaza, the church authorities are struggling to boost morale.“Christmas means Bethlehem like Easter means Jerusalem and there are so many families separated between Gaza and the West Bank. The feeling here is one of sadness,” says Father Gabriel Romanelli, from Brazil,\u0026nbspwho is the parish priest of Gaza’s Catholic church.15 years ago, there were 3,500 Christians in Gaza, now there are barely 1,000 left. We fear they will all leave“We\u0026nbsppray for peace and justice. We are trying to plan the church service on Christmas Day and funs things like bingo,” he adds.He says that the increasingly tough conditions in Gaza have\u0026nbspsparked an exodus of young Christians.\u0026nbsp“Fifteen years ago, there were 3,500 Christians in Gaza, now there are barely 1,000 left,” he says. “We fear they will all leave.”Mina (not his real name), a young Christian youth activist from Gaza, left for the West Bank town of Jericho last Christmas.Like many young Gazan Christians, he used a\u0026nbsptemporary Christmas permit\u0026nbspto leave Gaza for good.“I didn’t want to leave Gaza, I had no choice with the lack of work and life opportunities,” he explains.“The Israelis consider me to be illegally staying in the West Bank since my permit requires me to go home, but how else am I supposed to live?”It is tough to be Christian in Gaza, which is largely controlled by Islamist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Although Christians in Gaza do not face\u0026nbsppersecution as communities do in countries like Egypt, openly practising Christianity can be a taboo in Gaza’s conservative society.One Christian girl, who asked to remain anonymous, spoke of harassment from Muslim youth for wearing a crucifix or not covering her hair with a hijab, the Islamic headscarf.Hanna Maher, 40, who works for Gaza’s Baptist church, says it is hard to secure work or political positions with the Hamas-dominated authorities, while options of marriage are minimal.“The situation for all Gazans is tough, but as a minority it can be trickier,” he adds.At Gaza’s Orthodox church, weathered photos plaster the wall of Santa parades and Christmas scout performances in central Gaza in 1998, which would not be\u0026nbsppossible now.Older Christian residents recall days where they would erect Christmas trees in Gaza City’s main square.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn Christmas Eve, they would jump in the car and complete the hour-and-a-half drive to Bethlehem for mass.These are all memories of the past.“My wife hasn’t received a permit in six years, she has family in Bethlehem,” says Kaamil Ayat, a spokesman for the Orthodox church.“Now the permit situation is worse than it has ever been in terms of the numbers granted and the delay. We genuinely don’t know why.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child.

All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize.

He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face.

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath.

And then he also didn’t notice when the car span round and hit the front of his lorry again.And finally he didn’t notice when he was ­actually pushing the car SIDEWAYS along the busy dual carriageway.The man in the Golf was presumably leaning on his horn as hard as he was leaning on his brakes. Everyone in every other car on the road was also leaning on their horn and gesticulating.But still, chummy in the cab kept rolling along. I have spoken to lorry drivers about how this could be possible and they say that in the Daf truck that our friend was driving, it isn’t.They say that in a Volvo you sit so high up, your view of the road ahead is obscured by clouds and solar flares. But the seating ­position in a Daf is ­famously low down.So he MUST have noticed that instead of a teddy tied to his radiator grille, he had a full-sized Golf. Me though  I have another suggestion.Yes, the Golf’s tyres would have been making a right old din buthe’d had the radio on, maybe he didn’t hear them.And sure, it takes quite of lot of effort to push a Golf sideways along the road. But the engine in that Daf is designed to haul tonnes, and at the time of the incident no trailer was attached.Now that I’m a farmer, I understand the problem here. All my neighbouring farmers say that my new tractor is far too large.To which I say that tractors are like penises. And therefore cannot be too large. They also say the  horsepower it develops is too much.And on that, I sort of know what they mean. In a less powerful tractor you can sense when the ground is soft or the load is too heavy.But in mine, I just sit there listening to the radio, not noticing that my cultivator on the back has become entangled in a hedge and is ripping the whole thing out of the ground.Once, I turned round after I’d done a nice straight line across a field, to find I’d been pulling a whole postcode behind me.There were houses, schools and even a ­couple of churches in the mountain of mud I’d been dragging along.If I somehow hit a Volkswagen in my tractor, and I couldn’t see it out of the window, I definitely wouldn’t notice.Any more than I’d noticea baby wren landed on the roof. I’m sure that for the Golf driver on the A, it must have been a pretty scary moment. I sympathise with him.But I also sympathise with the lorry driver who set off to work as a man and arrived as an internet sensation with no one to sympathise with him except me and an eye-witness called Ellie Goulding.WE were told on Wednesday that Australia had endured its hottest day EVER.But that’s not strictly accurate. Yes, the average temperature across the whole of the country was .Cand that’s pretty toasty.But several million years ago, the world was around ten times hotter than that.And back in the days when rock was still liquid and the continents were sorting themselves out, temperatures hovered round the clock at around ,C.So when scientists say Australia has had its hottest day ever, what they mean is: “Australia has had its ­hottest day since records began.”Which in geological time is about . of a second.Big headlines in Buenos Aires, for sure. And maybe a fleet heading off to the Falklands again.WHEREVER my late mother is right now, she’ll be very happy, because Nicky Henson has died. She adored him.He was best known as the lothario from Fawlty Towers, but she loved him best for his stage performance in Noises Off.She loved him so much, in fact, thatmemory serves, she went to see him every night for about a year.Because it was so sweaty and horrid in there, I walked through the door, turned round and walked straight out again.IF you are wondering what to watch on TV over Christmas, may I suggest The Last Ship, on Amazon Prime.The executive producer is Michael Bay, which means everything blows up all the time.It features a really cool destroyer, some really bad baddies and some really cool goodies who say: “Secure the perimeter” every five minutes.Best of all, though, it stars the incomparable Rhona Mitra, whose work, and face, I’ve admired for years.THE Labourites squabbling over who will be their next party leader are all saying they’ll keep Jeremy Corbyn’s policies alive.This is excellent news because, in five years, we will get yet another chance to keep them out of Downing Street.SO, there’s a -year-old man in Norway who’s won  elite games of chess on the trot and is now the World Champion.That’s pretty impressive, but for Magnus Carlsen it’s just an aside, because in his local football league he’s a bit of a star as well.In fact, last time out, he scored  goals. At two, he could solve -piece jigsaw puzzles. By five he could recall the size, population and flag of every country on Earth.And by  he’d become a chess grandmaster. You’d imagine, then, that with such a mind he could do anything with his le. Unwrap the secrets of cold fusion.Conquer the problems of faster-than-light travel. Work out how you can open the wrapping of a Gillette razor using only your hands. But no.Instead, Magnus turned his attention to fantasy football, where, inevitably, he’s thrashed seven million other players to become the best in the world.As I write, he’s about to beat the all-time record of  undefeated games. And why did he do this, when he could have achieved so much more Well, it might have something to do with the fact he’s Norwegian. The Norse don’t like to make a fuss.They don’t like to stand out. Which is why, in the country’s entire history, all they’ve ever invented is the cheese kne.FINALLY, may I just take a moment to wish everyone in the whole world a very happy Christmas.Except Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.

But not quite.Even we, though, didn’t dare to dream that a proper Brexit — no customs union, no single market, fully taking back control — would pass by a thumping margin under a Boris Johnson Government beginning five years in power.The Remainer wreckers are gone. Yet, incredibly, Brexit was STILL opposed by the twitching corpse of the Labour Party in a last, spiteful two-fingered gesture to its former voters.What don’t these MPs get  They bet the house on a “people’s vote” and lost. And yet they still witter on about second referendums, customs unions or otherwise tying ourselves to the EU.One voice seemed to speak sense. “We recognise the clear message from the public,” said Jeremy Corbyn. “We have to respect that and move on.”Then, ridiculously, he led his rabble through the lobby to vote against Brexit one last time.A historic day, with Labour yet again on the wrong side of it. And for Corbyn, a dismal end to his inglorious week of sullen silence and door-slamming petulance.WE’RE confused.One minute Corbyn takes responsibility for his defeat. The next he blames hostility from “billionaire Press barons”.He cannot grasp a simple reality about The Sun. If we fear a wannabe Government will wreck the economy and destroy our readers’ jobs, we oppose it.But the Left think anyone not devoted to socialist purity must have corrupt motives. And for these zealots the answer is an even more left-wing leader. Maybe contender Clive Lewis, who makes Corbyn look like Norman Tebbit.Unless they grow out of this, they will spend their lives in impotent opposition.IT is high time to end voter fraud, using compulsory photo ID. We are delighted the Tories aim to do it.The Left always protests it is so rare it is not worth the fuss. Whatever could they be worried about  Surely not that the poorest will be deprived of their vote, since photo IDs will be free. What other motive could they have There is a wealth of first-hand or anecdotal evidence of people voting multiple times in dferent constituencies, stealing someone ’s vote, voting by post AND in person and so on.Conviction rates are low only because the system is so wide open it is hard to spot and catch offenders. But this is a serious crime meriting jail every time.And when so many routine tasks now require ID, one as vital to our democracy as casting your ballot certainly should.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because who wants to sit there being sold to Those were simpler days.So much has changed, including a new profession coming into existence: The influencer.The problem with influencers is that it’s impossible to tell whether they are enthusiastically mentioning products because they love them or because they are being paid to.Eventhey really love a certain cream or tea, when money changes hands, the water is muddied.We like to believe people would only promote products that make their lives better.But the clue is in the name. Anyone whose job title is “influencer” is being paid to sway their followers into buying things they otherwise would not.As a result, we don’t know who to trust.This was illustrated this week by Lauren Goodger being caught on camera for a BBC show agreeing to promote a drink containing hydrogen cyanide.The reality TV star was secretly filmed during a meeting where she was asked to promote a fake diet drink named Cyanora — said to contain the deadly chemical hydrogen cyanide — on Instagram.It was part of an investigation by the documentary into whether celebrities consume the products which they are paid to promote.The alacrity with which Goodger agreed to promote this fake product was alarming.Similarly worrying, to demonstrate her willingness to promote a product she had never tried, she talked about how she promoted another product, Skinny Coffee, which in January she claimed helped her lose lb in three weeks.“I never tried Skinny Coffee,” she admitted.To drive the point home, she added: “I’ve even had my own friends message me, ‘Laur, can you get me some of that Skinny Coffee, does it work ’ . . . I’m like, ‘Do you not know this by now ’ And they’re actually going and buying it and I’m like, ‘You know how this works’.”At least she is honest. When she doesn’t realise she is being recorded.By way of explanation, a representative for Goodger said: “Lauren was asked to . . . appear in an advert for a new water.“There was no mention of what the water contained before the meeting. The money on the table was quite a large sum.”Goodger herself said: “As with any audition, you people-please and say what they want to hear.“They asked me, ‘Would I promote the drink without using it ’ In the heat of the moment, I said yes and also said I hadn’t tried Skinny Coffee — in the hope of getting the job.“I would never promote anything on my Instagram that I don’t feel is right for my followers and that I haven’t used. The sit-down meeting after the audition was filmed undercover without my knowledge.”So I guess we take this to mean that had she known she was being filmed, she wouldn’t have been so up-front about the real role of an influencer.It is easy to forget that influencers are paid to promote products.Even those who start off promising to recommend only things they like are probably susceptible,the price is right. Andthat is the case, how can we believe anything is a genuine endorsement So, who can we trust  Let’s start with ourselves. Instead of handing our likes and values over to be decided by so-called influencers, we should remember our own sense of self and what we like and dislike.And let’s go back to another thing from the good old days: Trusting real friends instead of Instagram ones.FALLON SHERROCK made history this week as the first woman to beat a man at the PDC World Darts Championships.She was so surprised to beat Ted Evetts - at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday she wept tears of joy, saying: “I have proved we can play the men and we can beat them!”Fallon, , who until four years ago was a professional hairdresser, first picked up darts at the age of .She later added: “I can’t believe what I achieved. I’m so happy.I always had the game but us women have never had the opportunity to prove it.”Very true. But isn’t it mad  There is no reason why a woman can’t play darts as well as a man.But it also needs people to stop treating it like a service for plasters, reassurance and insignicant ailments.Take the man on C’s  Hours In AE who turned up at hospital with a stf neck.Issuing fines to time-wasters is the only way people will start to realise how valuable our NHS is – and how we need to treat it with the respect it deserves or risk losing it.I AM pleased the judge’s decision to impose two le sentences on “Black Cab Rapist” John Worboys could see him die behind bars.Mrs Justice Gowan handed Worboys, , a minimum term of six years for attacking four women and he will have no chance of parole before .Worboys, one of Britain’s worst sexual predators, now goes by the name John Derek Radford and has been in jail since  for abusing  other victims.It is believed he plied more than  women with drink laced with sedatives from a “rape kit” kept in his cab.The judge told him he may never be released, branding him “still dangerous”.For once, in this case le really does mean le. It is likely he will die in prison.And just think: Last year, the idiots on the Parole Board were actually going to let him out.PHOTOS of Beyonce at rapper Diddy’s th birthday party are jaw-dropping.She looked a million dollars in that dress .But also, who knew Alexis Carrington’s  Dynasty fashion was back  I guess we do now.JUSTIN Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been on the receiving end of some unfair bashing of late.Firstly he was accused by some of being a “leftie Remainer”. Then others called him a Tory. Obviously he can’t be both.To be called a racist by voices on the Left for defending the Chief Rabbi was outrageous.The Archbishop was criticised when he effectively backed the Chief Rabbi’s comments about the Labour leadership’s record on anti-Semitism with a tweet highlighting the “deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.Welby has done some great stuff lately, including going to ebola zones against all advice.Not only that, his voice is vital at this time of year as the country needs to come together post-election and at the start of a new decade.He was right to defend the Chief Rabbi and we should come together to support him as the leader of the Church of England.It is a tad violent, but it is great.Ben Hardy plays a guy who is an expert in extreme sport parkour .I met Ben when I was on ITV’s Lorraine this week.He is a lovely man and a great actor.I ADMIRE Sharon Osborne’s honesty about what she has done to look the way she does.Namely, she has spent £, on a facelt, tummy tuck, eye lt, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox, breast surgery, vaginal cosmetic surgery, and lost more than lb after gastric surgery.In the past, she has said: “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether.”Live and let live, I always say. Clearly Sharon is happy with the work she has had done and she looks great.Some people, we would say, grow old gracefully.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER! ORDER!” seems as quaintly ancient as Larry Grayson’s “Oooh, shut that door!” or Dick Emery’s “Oooh, you are awful – but I like you!”Bercow is reduced to bellowing “ORDER! ORDER!” to the baffled viewers of Italian TV.He has even been spied shouting his hackneyed catchphrase at his fellow travellers on a south London bus.It seems like only last week that Bercow took enormous preening delight in bellowing, “ORDER! ORDER!” at the mother of all Parliaments.Now yesterday’s Speaker is shouting it on the number  to Catford.He should have borrowed one of Ken Livingstone’s newts.IT has been a bad year for boxing when your favourite fistic moment is Kate Beckinsale demonstrating her stf right cross for Women’s Health magazine.At the start of , it seemed inevitable that Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder would have a series of fights to match the glory days of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman.They somehow all avoided each other.With the Fury-Wilder rematch allegedly about to be announced for February, perhaps  will be better for boxing.Andit’s not – well, fight fans have always got Kate Beckinsale’s right hander.AFTER Mathew Horne’s late-night trolling of the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, I am giving the Gavin  Stacey Christmas special a miss.You can watch performers you don’t care for.For example, I can’t stand Benedict Cumberbatch – the eco-activist who advertises cars in China – but I will watch Cumberbatch in Sam Mendes’ World War One film  next year because it sounds unmissable.But Gavin, Stacey and Mathew  I can live without it.Horne tweeted: “I really wish I loved myself as much as you, Laura . . . your ‘journalism’ knows no bounds . . . Resign, you disingenuous plopcarpet.”And plenty more of the same spiteful, semi-literate garbage.It is mind-blowing how totally lost these right-on Rada revolutionaries are when someone doesn’t write them a script.And voters really, REALLY don’t like it.EVERY one of the candidates who Hugh Grant campaigned for at the General Election lost. Lib Dem, Labour, male, female, anti-Brexit or . . .  actually, they were all anti-Brexit.It didn’t work – just as Steve Coogan telling Brexit supporters that we are ignorant did not make us rush out to vote to stop Brexit.I have come to believe that luvvie endorsements are totally counter-productive.They quite literally have the opposite effect that the smug, self-important thespians hope.The public take one look at Grant and Coogan – then vote exactly the opposite way. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You were wrong.Wrong to block Brexit. Wrong to present a manesto costing billions. And wrong to ask Britain to vote for an unelectable old leftie.But none of the candidates to replace Corbyn seem to understand why they suffered such a crushing defeat.Keir Starmer praised Corbyn’s “radicalism” and said Labour should build on his disastrous approach.And let’s not forget he sat in Corbyn’s top team as decent MPs were driven out and the party was poisoned by racism and extremism.Emily Thornberry launched her campaign by suggesting Labour should have blocked the election. The rest of us thought they needed a leader the country could vote for.Along with Rebecca Long-Bailey and David Lammy, she nominated Corbyn for the leadership — and that should rule all of them out of replacing him.There’s another long list of candidates for deputy leader. The most ridiculous has to be Richard Burgon.The Leeds MP said: “The mistake we made was being persuaded that people did not quite want to get Brexit done as their top priority.”Can someone provide a translation Labour lefties are blaming anyone but themselves.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be. The Andrew scandal is far from over and  could be a pivotal year for the Duke, who has yet to face the FBI.So when you watch the Queen give her Christmas message tomorrow afternoon, spare a thought for someone who has served this country so dutully and for so long.An amazing woman of true decency and honour.We remain lucky to have her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris’s moving encouragement to British Jews show that he is clearly determined to make them feel at home in the wake of Corbyn’s stunning and very welcome defeat.”He went on to say that his Jewish friends were “stunned” by Boris’ Hanukkah message and that they would have been “frightened” in Britain with a Corbyn win.He added: “If Labour had won, Jews would have been frightened to proclaim their identity.“Boris by contrast celebrates it with them. Thus does Boris heal the country, starting with the Jews.”Mr Shawcross was previously Chairman of the Charity Commission for England and Wales.Boris is such a joy as PM! He has such enthusiasm, he is so bold, he has such marvelous and often funny turns of phrase, and he has such great instincts.Take for example his  minute film greetings to the Jewish people, released yesterday on the feast of Hanukah. It is exuberant, funny, important and very moving.Celebrating Jewishness, Boris said: “ Its really important right now because I know that recent years have not been easy ones for British Jews.“In the media, on the streets and specially online, Anti-Semites in alarming numbers have been emboldened to crawl out from under their rocks and begin to spread their brand of noxious hatred.He did not mention the Labour Party but he did not have to. It is out from under Labour rocks that some of the most vicious British anti-Semites have crawled.Labour used to be the natural home of Britain’s small but hugely vibrant Jewish community of some ,.But since Corbyn became leader, that once great party has been mired in hideous anti-Semitism.The Jewish Labour Movement, affiliated to Labour for almost a hundred years, stated in a recent terrying report, that “Antisemitic behaviour is pervasive at all levels” of Corbyn’s Labour.The report said that the abuse used by some Labour members against Jews - “cockroaches, subhumans, a cancer on the world” was reminiscent of Nazi Germany.Imagine - Dame Margaret Hodge the veteran Jewish MP for Barking said that she faced ”much more” anti-Semitism from the Labour Party than from the BNP !All in all, Jews were so frightened of Labour before the election that % of those polled said they would leave the countryCorbyn won.They would have been wise.Boris’s moving encouragement to British Jews show that he is clearly determined to make them feel at home in the wake of Corbyn’s stunning and very welcome defeat.In his convivial manner, praising the feast Hanukah, he said that he recently had the joy of baking a few latkes and doughnuts when he visited Golders Green during the election.And he pointed out, “Who can argue with a festival where the kids get presents every day of the week.More seriously, he said it was not only the moment to celebrate the miracle of Hanukah itself, “But also your unique identity… to put the Hanukah menorah in the window and say to the world … I am Jewish and I am proud of it.“And that’s really important right now.”Boris is right. If Labour had won, Jews would have been frightened to proclaim their identity.Boris by contrast celebrates it with them.“As you kindle the Hanukah light tonight and in the nights to come I want you to remember this….As Britain’s Jews seek to drive back the darkness of resurgent anti-Semitism….you have every decent person in this country fighting by your side.”Why “ Because Britain would not be Britain without its Jewish community.“And we will stand with you and celebrate with you all year round.”This speech is only two minutes but it is a work of genius. All my Jewish friends are stunned by it – by his humour, his knowledge of their history and his total, positive embrace of their cause.They no longer feel alone and abused.I doubtany Jews will leave now. If the polls are correct, well over , might have fled Corbynism.Thus does Boris heal the country, starting with the Jews.

The Radfordaposs Christmas food shopping list includes: Four lots of -piece sharing selections  vegetable spring rolls  chilli cheese bites  tempura king prawns Two packets of Yorkshire puddings Packet of large prawns Feta cheese Cottage cheese Orange juice Apple juice Halloumi  Soft cheese Edam Squeezy cheese Smoked cheese Babybels Coleslaw  roast chicken flavour bites Spaghetti hoops Beans Crackers Yogurts Pancakes Orange squash  slices of ham Sliced beef   mozzarella sticks Tex Mex platter Apples Potatoes Bacon Salad cream Chocolate trle Raspberry trle Strawberry trle Tomato ketchup Strawberry milkshake  Crisps Stuffing Four loaves of bread Dips Alcohol Four boxes of cereal Two cucumbers Parsnips Carrots  Lettuce Three quiches Sprouts Pain au chocolat Six pints of milk x  Golden syrup Crackers Roulade x  Chocolate log  Raspberry pavlova Lemon cake Chocolate fudge cake Toffee pavlova Salted caramel and chocolate cake Two tubs of Celebrations Chocolate biscuits Three tubs of Quality Street Tub of Haribo And finally.... a tub of Roses  Meanwhile, the Radfords first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting.  Baby Bonnie was the last addition to the brood in November bringing the number of children to a whopping . She arrived after a swt  minute labour weighing lb oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family. However, they are now expecting another baby girl in the new year. They live with the majority of their kids in a -bed, four-storey Victorian property, a former care home, which they bought almost  years ago. Sue and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits. Some of the oldest offspring have since moved out and started families of their own with Sue and Noel being grandparents to four. The Radford children are: Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, eight, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, and Archie, two, and Bonnie, one. Bonnie had the same due date as Alfie who was stillborn in .  After Archie was born, the couple said it was strange knowing he would be their last. And when the entire family appeared on ITVaposs This Morning in January , Sue said: Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby. But eldest daughter Sophie, who has three kids herself, shook her head and claimed she canapost see her mum stopping - and she wasnapost wrong as months later Sue fell pregnant with Bonnie. Childhood sweethearts Sue and Noelaposs first child, Chris, was born when Sue was aged just . The parents were both given up for adoption after they were born, and they decided to keep Chris and raise him as teenage parents. They got married and had their second child, Sophie, when Sue was .  Noel even had a vasectomy, later reversed, after baby number nine. The pair face a monumental task each day just to feed, clothe and ferry about their huge brood. They spend an estimated £, a year of their own money bringing up their children - including birthdays with a reported budget of £ per child and Christmas at £ to £ per child. In addition, they also have a holiday abroad each year.

Captured on a mobile phone, the amorous pair appear completely oblivious to the fact everyone can see them committing the sex act in the middle of the dancefloor.The video of the incident, which took place at The Beach nightspot in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, has been widely shared on Facebook with the heading Sh*****g in The Beach. The local pubwatch group has said it was aposunacceptable behaviourapos and warned anyone caught in the act could be banned from the resortaposs bars for up to a year, reports Grimsby Live .Anne Coleman, chairman of Cleethorpes PubWatch, said: It is not acceptable. Thankfully these incidents are very few and far between. But it is not acceptable. It is clear that the door staff and management  were distracted in some way, otherwise they would have dealt with it and ejected the two of them. There would have been about  to  people in there. She said the staff were likely dealing with other matters, like a drunk person, adding: No one would allow that to happen. Ms Coleman said the person behind the camera is just as bad as the two having sex and while they have thought it was all a laugh, it is unacceptable. They are idiots. Why would any woman allow someone do that to them  Letaposs be honest. Did they go out that night with the intention of doing that  They were probably drunk. How many people have sex in toilets that you donapost know about  The chairman went on to say she doubted the police would carry out any kind of investigation but said she and other members of Pubwatch would be discussing it at the next meeting.  I will raise it. But what can you do  It is Christmas, have the police not got enough to do  Yes, she continued.  Do people want to find out who the couple are  I doubt it. She saidit had happened at her nightspot she would be disgusted but said Humberside Police were unlikely to share the identities of the culprits due to Data Protection. Having sex in public is a criminal offence, with laws relating to outraging public decency and behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress contrary to the  Public Order Act. However, police usually only take any actiona complaint is made, with fines usually between £ to £. Ms Coleman warned that bad behaviour in bars and clubs can lead to a series of sanctions starting with a warning, then bans of between three months, six months or a year. She said the footage should be remove. Another unnamed manager, who has years of experience in the Cleethorpes night time economy, said the incident reflected everything that is wrong with the industry and why licensing laws need to be observed and enforced. Philip Campbell, manager of The Beach, said something like this has never happened before in his club and is not the norm in Cleethorpes. This kind of behaviour is not tolerated.

This allows the turkey to cook gently ensuring a moist turkey as the end result. Half an hour before the end of the cook, remove the foil andto the oven to crisp the skin. Remember to check that the turkey is cooked by piercing the turkey to check that the juices run clear. Leave to rest for at least half an hour. If you wrap in foil, the turkey will stay warm for an hour. When you take your turkey out of the oven it will continue to cook.

Graham Branfield, , claimed £, in Disability Living Allowanceand £, in pension credit over  years. A former neighbour, Helen Gillespie, told Bristol Crown Court he was also a regular dog walker and would shop at Morrisons and carry items without dficulty. Branfield denied fraudulently claiming the payments, but a jury convicted him after deliberating for  minutes on December . Retired shopkeeper Brian Sheehan, who runs Fur and Feathers in Knowle, also gave evidence during the trial. He said Branfield regularly purchased heavy bags of wild bird seed and pigeon corn from him two or three times a week. He said the pensioner would park his car near the premises before carrying kg or kg bags to it without dficulty. Ultimately, Department of Works and Pensionsstaff tailed Branfield as he went on one of his regular shopping runs, and captured evidence on camera. Branfield, who had an interest in feeding wild birds, said he was suffering from a plethora of debilitating ailments for which he was medicated but he was still able to move around in pain. He also admitted to a small amount of catalogue work, for which he said he drove, reports Bristol Live . On December , Judge James Patrick jailed Branfield for two years, to run extra to a four-year term he is serving for breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order. The judge said: This was a simply breath-taking piece of dishonesty. You are an intelligent man and a man with some charm. But you are a manipulative man.  Your application may have been honest from the beginning but you saw it as a blank cheque. You received very large sums of money indeed. The jury heard interviews Branfield gave in early  during an investigation into alleged benefit fraud. He said he had claimed DLA as he was suffering a lot and took pain medication. Branfield said he suffered from a joint and muscle problem, renal problems and incontinence. He said medication gave him the chance to be mobile but he was still in a lot of pain when moving and it had not got any better in the past  years. He said he could not walk even small distances without pain. He added a doctor had advised him Betterware catalogue work and feeding birds were giving him something to live for.

Award-winning Michelin-starred cook Jeff Baker, who has fed the likes of the Queen, previously told us how we were cooking sausages and bacon wrong. And now the Executive Development Chef, who works at  Farmison  Co , has lted the lid on how to rustle up delicious tasting roasties every time. The roast potato is a staple addition to our Christmas dinner and arguably the best part, but they can be one of the most dficult components to perfect. Jeff has more than three decades experience in a professional kitchen, and has worked with some of the best in the business - so he knows his stuff. Here he shares his tips with .... You must buy fresh potatoes It may sound obvious, but having fresh potatoes to make roasties is the first step to perfection. You should never try to use old potatoes when cooking as they could be rotten which is sure to make you very, very ill. When you buy your potatoes, you should inspect them for any signs of mould or damage and then place the perfect potatoes in a cardboard box or paper bag - this ensures the best ventilation. To store, put your potatoes in a cool and dark place that is approximately  to  degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure to check your potatoes whilst they are being stored, as they may become soft and shrivelled and will, therefore, need to be thrown away.. Know your King Edward from your Maris Piper  Yes, there are perfect potatoes for roasting! By choosing the best potato for the job you can ensure that you will get the gorgeous crispy edges and fluffy centres that we all dream of. I would recommend King Edwards or Maris Pipers, which are readily available this time of the year. However, your standard white potatoes will also work, you just may need to give them a good shake in a sieve after par-boiling to fluff them up.. Stay away from soggy roasties  A mistake can be made in trying to crisp up your potatoes by almost drowning them in oil, leaving them burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside. This is why it is important to fluff up your potatoes before roasting by partially boiling or using my preferred method of steaming. You can parboil your spuds for ten minutes in salted water or steam for  minutes . Be sure to allow your potatoes to dry and cool slightly before roasting.  . Feeding the   Your roasties will need some room…  As most of us are cooking for our whole family at Christmas time, we will be making a lot of food and lots of roast potatoes. If you’re making more than usual, several trays are recommended instead of forcing them all on one tray. This is because the potatoes need the space to crisp up in the oil or you run the risk of them becoming soggy as they sit in the oil. So make sure that you grab an extra roasting tray or two so that all your hard work does not go to waste!. Yes, it all comes down to the perfect timing The debate of how long you should cook your spuds is definitely up for contesting around Christmas time.

Some people who purchased festive poultry from Tesco, Sainsburyaposs, Aldi and Morrisons had to make last minute changes to their dinner plans when they say they discovered the meat was rotten. Divya Gill bought her turkey on December and came to prep it for the big day on Christmas Eve. When she did she says she discovered it was stinking and out of date. Absolutely appalled at Morrisons to buy a turkey two days ago and to open it to prep today for it to be completely out of date - as in my dog started gagging - when the sell by date is the th, Divya said. Lucky that we opened it today and MS had plenty of not rotten food left. Vicky Broomhead also had issues with the turkey she bought from Morrisons. Have you had a Christmas dinner disaster  Email webnews@mirror She said: I have just come to prep my turkey to go in the oven and it stinks. It has gone off so now thereaposs no turkey for family on Xmas day.Morrisons was not the only supermarket chain to come under fire from disgruntled Christmas dinner enthusiast.James Davies claims he picked up his bird from an Aldi on December  and placed it in the fridge as soon as he got home. He said: When we came to cook it this afternoon, Christmas Eve, we were concerned by the nasty smell coming from it. Nevertheless, we still cooked it in the oven, but the smell still remained, and clearly the meat was rotten. Our Christmas dinner is completely ruined for tomorrow. We have no replacement. Ricky Yates has similarly been left one turkey short of a full dinner after claiming to discover his Aldi purchase was off.  We opened the turkey after all supermarkets were closed, and are now left with trimmings and a cheese board to fill Christmas lunch, he said. According to industry website britishturkey a turkey will smell very gamey, acrid or of ammoniait has gone off. The flesh could also have a greenish tinge and feel quite slimy. If in any doubt - donapost risk it - bin it, advice on its website reads. The flesh should be in good colour and look moist in appearance with no dry flaky patches. Beth noticed some of these tell-tale signs despite buying a turkey from Tesco on the evening of December  and quickly refrigerating it. I went to put prepare it onand it stinks to high heaven, she said.  It is slimy and stinks rotten. Not great on Christmas Eve night. Says the best before date is the th but clearly not. Ann Doggett had similar issues with her Sainsburyaposs bird. She said: Turkey consigned to the bin as the smell and grey slimy look of it was disgusting.

Jeff Baker, Executive Development Chef at Farmison  Co , has shared withhis  top tips for a stress-free festive feast. The award-winning Michelin-starred cook, who has fed the likes of the Queen, previously told us how we were cooking  sausages , bacon  and roast potatoes wrong.And now he has lted the lid on making the perfect gravy, turkey, cheese board and more. Here Jeff shares his tips and tricks... . Get the drinks in the fridge...now! Amongst the carnage of cooking times and counting plates, we usually forget about the drinks. To avoid any upset once your guests have arrived - pop your fizz, white wine or beer in the fridge as soon as you can. Not your tipple  If you’re partial to a bottle of red, ensure that it’s been opened a few hours before dinner to let it breathe and intensy the flavour. . Pre-feast nibbles to satisfy all the guests Don’t faff around with fancy canapes and waste valuable cooking time! Whipping up super speedy nibbles couldn’t be any easier.  Smoked meats and fish make for a tasty and simple selection whilst you prepare for the main event. Simply serve with sourdough and condiments of your choice. This tip means that you can get back to perfecting your feast without worrying about entertaining your guests. . A scrumptious starter fit for a feast If you are looking to impress with an indulgent intro to your dinner, baked figs with fresh goats curd and truffle honey will go down a treat. Bake the figsin a cool oven at about °c with the truffle honeyuntil tender . Next, mix together with walnut oiland sherry vinegar , toss in with some rocket leaves and distribute the contents into  bowls. Add the figs and curdinto each bowl and scatter over some broken walnuts. . The perfect gravy  Easy peasy  There’s no need to cut corners and reach for the instant gravy this Christmas. After roasting your Christmas bird, simply tip the excess fat from your roasting tray and add stock of your choice . With the stock in the tray, scrape any leftover meat sediment into the stock and boil to reduce the volume. Add herbs of your choice and pass the liquid through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Want a real rich treat  Reduce the gravy to a syrup texture and whisk in a large knob of cold unsalted butter and enjoy! . Roasties from the freezer  I don’t think so…  Arguably the most dficult element of the Christmas spread are the roast potatoes. My top tip is to peel, wash, and steam your potatoes until they are just cooked. This will usually take around  minutes. Once cooked, melt duck fat and toss through the potatoes and season with sea salt. Place on a non-stick tray in a preheated oven set at c, and roast until golden - it’s best to turn them every  mins to ensure this . . How to get the most out of your meat: Turkey  To get the best flavour as well as use up as much of the meat as you can I would suggest to remove the giblets after roasting and keep them for the gravy later. On the day of roasting, sit the turkey in your kitchen and slowly bring it up to room temperature, this ensures an even roast - and don’t forget to weigh your turkey! Soften g of butter with the zest of a lemon, some sea salt, thyme leaves, and a splash of olive oil . Gently lt the skin away from the breast meat, starting at the cavity, and carefully push the softened butter between the skin and flesh. To stuff, cut an onion in two and place it into the cavity with the rindless lemon and a carrot with some fresh sage. Now put the turkey on a wire trivet and place in a preheated oven at °c for  minutes. Then pour ml of water onto the base of the tray and cover the turkey with tin foil. Reduce the heat to °c and roast  minutes per kilo, removing the tin foil for the last  minutes or so to colour the skin. To check the turkey is cooked, pierce the skin between thigh and breast and push the skewer into the flesh, close to the bone. If all has gone to plan, the juices should run clear. Ta da! . Struggle to get the kids to eat vegetables  They’ll ask for seconds with this tip To add extra flavour to carrots, turnips, parsnips and shallots, I simply place them together in a tin foil bag with a sprig of thyme or rosemary, a whole garlic clove, sea salt, and a teaspoon of duck fat. I then bake in the oven for a minimum of  hour until the vegetables are sweet and lightly caramelized. For green vegetables and brassica, I boil them in salted water until just cooked, then I refresh in ice-cold water and drain. To finish, I gently toss in a little butter and cracked pepper, sometimes with toasted almonds, caraway seeds or crispy smoked bacon and a few diced shallots. . An alternative to roast potatoes Yes, there are some people who don’t like the classic roastie. Luckily, parsnip and potato gratin is simple to make and acts as a scrumptious substitute to the royal roast potato. Mix warm equal amounts of whole milk and creamwith a couple of crushed garlic cloves, salt and ground white pepper. Once the mixture is nicely infused, pour it over g of thinly sliced potatoes mixed with g of thinly sliced parsnips. Layer in a gratin dish and bake at °c for  minutes, then continue to lower the heat to °c and cook for a further  minutes until the potatoes are tender. To ensure a cake like texture, press the gratin down now and again. . Mix up your pigs in blankets  Pigs in blankets are a staple at the Christmas table - but there’s no harm in mixing it up a little this year. Try wrapping a pitted prune in some Lancashire pancetta, insert a little sage leaf between the two items, and simply grill. These ‘devils on horseback’ go particularly well with goose and duck as well as all your other roasting birds. . Rich, buttery bread sauce, look no further Take  slices of brioche without crust and turn them into crumbs, then heat ml of whole milk with   diced onion and bouquet garni - then season with salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg. Pour the infused milk onto the breadcrumbs and cook on a gentle heat until slightly thickened. Then whisk in g of cold diced butter and keep at a warm temperature. This recipe can of course be made with simple white breadcrumbs for those guests who prefer a more traditional sauce. . Master your cheese board Serve cheeses made with dferent types of milk- ewe’s, cow’s, goat’s, even buffalo milk, or those made from a blend of milks. Each type of milk has a dferent flavour profile and this will make your selection more ied. Also think about ying textures, smooth, crumbly or sticky, they all make for a great cheese board. I would serve alongside semi dried fruits, some quality butter, and a biscuit or two. If you really want to push the boat out, you could opt for some fruit cheese or truffle honey. Before serving, remove cheeses from their packaging and leave uncovered at room temperature for at least an hour, or even longer. This way, the cheese can breathe and you’ll be able to taste the full spectrum of flavours in each. Be careful not to let the cheese touch each other too much as this can alter the flavour! . Never know what to do with the leftovers  Create another quick and delicious Boxing Day meal as a way to use up any leftover turkey! Dice  onions and soften with a crushed clove of garlic, then add a glass of dry white wine and boil into a syrup. Move on to add ml of poultry stock and ml of cream, bring to the boil and season with salt and pepper. Roughly slice a selection of mixed mushroomsand add to the sauce, then add your shredded turkey and a dozen or so chestnuts, walnuts or almonds to the mix. Simmer for  minutes on a low heat.

Much of the UK will wake up to frosty and foggy conditions on Christmas morning, before the wintry weather lts to make way for sunshine later in the day.Christmas Day is looking like a lovely day for pretty much the whole of the UK, Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said. It is highly unlikely there will be any signicant snowfall this year. If there is any snow, it will be over the tops of Scottish mountains, which we donapost class as a white Christmas. Temperatures in Scotland are forecast to fall to lows of minus C and about C in England and Wales. That will increase to about C in northern parts of the UK and C in the south, the Met Office said. The thickest of the morning fog is likely to be in Wales and central and western parts of England. But the pleasant conditions will be short lived, with rain and and wind forecast for parts of the UK throughout Boxing Day.  Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: Boxing Day goes downhill a bit, with rain pushing in from the west and gradually transferring north east. There will be spells of rain for everyone and it will be quite breezy, with gales around the western coasts pushing inland. Englandaposs south-western coast is forecast to be hit by mph to mph winds, which will reduce to mph to mph further inland. A band of rain will also sweep in from the West, pushing into the North East by the late morning, the Met Office said.  Temperatures on Boxing Day will be mild, reaching C in the South West and up to C in the midlands. The Environment Agency has also warned of potential flooding across England, due to further wet weather later in the week.  flood warnings are in place across England, as well as  flood alerts, while  warnings are no longer in force.  The agencyaposs flood duty manager Carol Holt said: Following wet weather over the past week and with more rain forecast, there is a continued risk of flooding in large parts of England over the festive period.

UK  day weather forecast Tuesday  Dec - Saturday  Dec This Evening and Tonight: Rain and showers clearing all but northern Scotland with winds easing for many, particularly the southwest. Chilly, particularly for the west, southwest and far northeast with frost and fog patches. Wednesday: A fine Christmas Day for most after a cold start with fog patches slow to clear.

The Queen and her relatives come together to celebrate the festivities at their Norfolk estate Sandingham, enjoying three days of family fun. And while their celebrations are obviously slightly fancier than the rest of us, lots of the traditions are surprisingly similar to ours. They open presents, sit down for a huge turkey dinner, have catch-ups and even watch the Queenaposs Speech. Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, George, Charlotte, Louis and other senior members of the family will all be there - but Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Archie are missing the celebrations this year. Weaposve had a look at what the Royals will be getting up to this Christmas. Christmas Eve Afternoon tea Members of the Royal Family arrive at Sandringham at dferent times, but once theyaposre all there and unpacked they gather for afternoon tea. Itaposs believed to be a formal occasion, with the men in black tie and the women wearing gowns and jewels. Opening presents To incorporate their German heritage into the festivities, the family used to open their presents on Christmas Eve as is traditional in the country. Shortly after they arrive they all lay their gts out on dferent tables, so each guest has their own little pile. Prince Philip oversees organising the gts and tells everyone when they can open them. However during a chat with Mary Berry Kate said that they now just open one present on Christmas Eve, and save the rest for the next day. The family exchange cheap joke presents, and in the past Kate bought Harry a aposGrow your Own Girlfriendapos Kit and the Prince got his granny a Leaposs a B****apos shower cap.  Christmas Day Breakfast The royals kick off the big day with breakfast, but many of the couples split up for the first festive meal. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady the women tend to eat in their rooms while the men sit together downstairs. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: On Christmas Day, the ladies generally opt for a light breakfast of sliced fruit, half a grapefruit, toast and coffee delivered to their rooms. The men on the other hand have a much heartier breakfast, usually including eggs, bacon, mushrooms, kippers and grilled kidneys. Church The public get to see the Royals when they head out to a traditional Christmas Day church service at St Mary Magdalene. Hundreds of well-wishers usually gather to see them as they walk into the building, and they often stop to have a chat on the way out. Trips to Church is the only time the Queen carries cash, and she normally pops either a fiver or a tenner in the collection pot - but it could be more at Christmas. Sources have said thereaposs a chance we might see George and Charlotte attending their first royal Christmas church service this year.  Christmas lunch The festive feast is the main event in most homes on Christmas Day, and itaposs no dferent for the Royals who site down to eat at pm. Former royal chef Darren McGrady revealed exactly what the Queen eats during an interview with Good Housekeeping . He said: After church, thataposs when they have a big lunch that includes a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. They stick with the same meal year after year. Sounds delicious!  The Queenaposs Speech Yep, thataposs right - just like the rest of us the Royal Family sit down and watch grannyaposs speech on the BBC at pm. Itaposs prerecorded which means the Queen can watch it back surrounded by her loved ones. Afternoon tea After the speech they all go off for a bit of free time, before gathering again for afternoon tea and a slice of Christmas fruit cake. Chats with the Queen According to former royal butler Paul Burrell, all the royals like to have a one-to-one chat with the Queen during the day, but thereaposs one popular time to do it. Before Princess Dianaaposs first royal Christmas, he advised her to try and get some quality time with the monarch when she was sitting at her card table.  Speaking to the Mail Online, he said: All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than le, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and theyaposre bouncing off the walls after four days. Itaposs like a pinball machine. They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, itaposs the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression. Itaposs what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. The best time to do it is when sheaposs seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and sheaposll always ask people to join her, thataposs your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what youaposre thinking and feeling. Dinner Before long itaposs time for ANOTHER meal, and the royal chefs put on an evening buffet for dinner. Former chef Darren McGrady said thereaposs a buffet dinner with - dferent items. Itaposs always a buffet with the chefs at the table carving.  Before they all tuck in the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the meat. Once heaposs done, the Queen gives him a glass of whiskey and they toast. Itaposs the only time the chef is invited into the dining room. He also revealed that the Queen has a real penchant for chocolate, particularly the dark and minty iety. Apparently she always has a chocolate treat on Christmas. Boxing Day The next day the family will head on on their annual Boxing Day pheasant hunt. Some of the family leave the estate to visit other relatives on Boxing Day. The Cambridges, for example, will head off to celebrate with Kateaposs family, where they enjoy another busy day of festive fun.

Chad spent six days looking for -month-old pup Nymeria, ing home early from work on some days to continue the search, posting on social media and driving around the area hoping to find a sign of his beloved pet. Nymeria had lost the sight in one of her eyes after being bitten by a stray dog when she was younger, but she continued to play and share food with the same dog as Chad described her as the most gentle dog heaposs ever owned aposwithout a mean bone in her bodyapos.She wore a large yellow collar with a huge tag containing her photo and her owneraposs contact details, as reported by the Sun Herald .Chadaposs search came to a devastating end when he looked in the postbox at his home in Mississippi to find Nymeriaaposs collar and a note sealed in a plastic bag. The typed message read: Iaposm sorry to inform you that your dog was shot and killed Saturday night while digging through my garbage. It did not suffer and I did not take pleasure in killing it. There is a county leash law which you should abide by so that I do not have to kill any more of your pets.Chad updated his Facebook page, where he had appealed for help to find Nymeria, to write an open letter to aposthe coward who shot my girlapos - hoping the post would be widely shared enough to reach the person who had done it. He expresses his anger that the person responsible wasnapost brave enough to tell him the news face-to-face, and that they allowed so many people to waste their time looking for the wolfdog aposwho was already deadapos. Secondly, you never gave me a chance to correct the problem, you never came to me and told me my dog was tearing up your trash, he said. The type of person I am, I would not only have picked it all up but would have made sure it didn’t happen again. You made reference to a leash law and unfortunately she was off for a brief moment . That gives you no right to shoot my dog without giving me a chance to make it right. It’s sad to think I have a neighbor of your moral character living so close to me that would do this. Do I hate you  No, I pity the person you are and those who have to tolerate you.  Only thing you did right here washer collar and let me know you had killed her. Chad hits out at the stranger for not ing his dogaposs body for a proper burial, and says he was just one week away from completing a fenced one-acre area for his dogs so he could always keep an eye on them. He finishes the message: I hope you feel good about your actions as they reflect the type of person you really are. I pray one day you come to realise what you have done and teach those in your household to be better.

Bulgarian born Baba Vanga has been dubbed the aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos for her predictions. Despite dying  years ago, those with a keen interest in mysticism continue to revere Babaaposs work, which some claim looks forward to  - the year she believed the universe will end. Right before her death at the age of  she made a series of predictions for the year . The most startling revelation is that Vladamir Putin and Donald Trumpaposs lives are in danger. The Russian president could reach the end of his mortal coil thanks to an assassination attempt made from within the Kremlin. Almost as dramatically, the US president will fall ill with a mysterious illness which will leave him deaf and with a brain tumour. Those with long memories may remember Baba foretold that Putin and Trumpaposs lives would be in danger last year, suggesting some kind of cosmic rollover.  Another recurrent theme in her predictions has been the destruction of Asia. Baba foresaw that “a big wave will cover the shore and people will disappear underwater” in what some interpreted as the destruction of Thailand by a huge tsunami in . The outlook in  is equally as bleak, with more tsunamis and earthquakes scheduled to hit the continent. A meteorite is also predicted to fall on Russia.  Perhaps the most ominous prediction of the clairvoyant was that the European continent could reach the end of its existence at the hands of Muslim extremists The Bulgarian suggested that extremists would use an arsenal of chemical weapons against Europeans”. Supporters of Baba are keen to emphasise how spot on she has been, with % accurate a phrase that regularly crops up in fan forums. According to baba-vanga, the figure is drawn from research conducted by Professor Georgi Lozanov - a former director of the Bulgarian Institute of Suggestology. Others point to her past successes as proof that she had foresight beyond that of a typical human.  In  she guessed that America would be hit by two apossteel birdsapos in a terror attack, in what was later interpreted as a reference to  . She said: Horror, horror! The American brothers will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing. Babaaposs big breakthrough had come a year earlier however, when she accurately predicted the sinking of Russian submarine the Kursk. Before cancelling Christmas and ordering a nuclear bunker however, readers should know that some questions remain around Baba and her predictions - some of which have been proved to be way off the mark.  Her prophecy that Europe would cease to exist by  was clearly wrong, unless seen through an incredibly generous Brexiteer lense. Babaaposs suggestion that the  FIFA World Cup final would be played between two teams beginning with the letter aposbapos was equally wrong. The nuclear war pencilled in for the years  to  also failed to materialise. Perhaps more damning is the seemingly non-existent nature of her prophecies. While Baba may have spoken or written down her predictions in Bulgarian, no credible version is available to view. According to a  Washington Post investigation, the few prophecies that can be traced back to their origins appear to come from Russian social media. When Bulgarian newspaper  Chasa interviewed Babaaposs neighbours, they said she had never predicted  , the sinking of the Kursk or the big war.

at Tannadice and then a poor - defeat on home turf the last time they met.And the former Hearts and Falkirk man is keen to put that right on Friday night as the two go head to head once more at the home of league leaders United.McGhee told the Tele: “We want to do ourselves justice this time.“We have to lay a glove on United – the last two times we didn’t.“In derbies you have to earn the right to play first of all and we’ve fallen short.“We need to put our own stamp on the game and then relax and play our normal game.“Derbies are always dferent.“It doesn’t matter how well you are playing or how well the opposition are playing, it’s just about who wants it most on the day.“Whoever executes the gameplan best and keeps the head normally wins the game.“Regardless of how many they’ve won in a row, it would be nice to win a derby, not only for ourselves as players, but also for the fans and the club. vw, px\"  “Eventhey had lost their last nine games, there would be massive pressure on us to win anyway.”McGhee admits that pressure has been on all season at Dens Park during some dficult spells.However, he expected nothing  after signing for the club in the summer.The -year-old is the club’s only ever-present in the league this season and is keen to maintain his consistent start to le at Dens Park.He added: “I’ve played every game which I’m quite proud of coming into a new club.“I’m delighted the gaffer has shown the faith in me to do that and I can’t thank him or the club enough for giving me the chance.“I knew coming to Dundee I had to up my game with the size of the club and the players I would be playing with.“I am used to that after playing at Hearts with the pressure there is at a club like that.“My aim was to take myself back to that level and I feel I’ve done that this season.“I need to keep moving forward, work hard and see where it takes us.”Dundee head into Friday night with two welcome wins at their backs and McGhee was delighted to notch a clean sheet in a - win at Partick over the weekend.“It was a good win down at Partick,” he said.“I think we could have scored more goals but we did play really well.“We created chances and I can’t really remember them having many, apart from when Kenny Miller hit the bar on the break.“It was a good performance and set us up to look forward to Friday night’s game.“It was a comfortable end to the game for us.“The boys worked their socks off which makes things easier for us defenders.“I didn’t feel threatened at all during the entire game which is pleasing – that’s not happened every week this season for us.“To get a clean sheet, too, is great for the confidence at the back to take into Friday night.“I think the last two games were among our best ones of the season, apart from the last half-hour against Dunfermline obviously.“It feels like we are starting to click and can try to get some consistency going, get points on the board, keep churning away and see where it takes us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Natural reforestation of this land increased carbon uptake by plants, leading to a  consequent decline in atmospheric CO and finally a decrease in temperature – the Little Ice Age.  This theory is supported by coincident changes in local pollen deposits and by Antarctic ice-core records revealing trapped air bubbles from this time period with low CO levels.Any lessons for today Unfortunately, today#s problems are on a completely dferent scale.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes. Half-time came giving a much-needed break to the players and spectators.Eilidh Cameron obliged with her customary goal a minute into the second half, however, Ardnamurchan replied  minutes later.The game was in the balance but Eilidh Cameron got the decisive goal on  minutes.The play continued to flow from end to end and at full time both teams had good reason to hold their heads high after providing such entertaining shinty for the crowd.Euan McMurdo, Shinty Regional Development officer, said: #Credit has to go to the players and coaches for providing such an entertaining match at a time of year when most people want to stay warm indoors.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The cringeworthy wailing that we are being ignored, that this is all an outrage, that somehow the panto Tory villains have done us in - itrsquos just embarrassing.In contrast to those in England , who are more positive, business people in Scotland are much less so. They cannot take the view that political uncertainty is behind us and start planning for growth.

That wonrsquot happen but what those who support independence fail to realise is that there are few really large businesses which are only active in Scotland, they have activities well beyond it and the choice of where investment goes is affected by political uncertainty. There are also few owners of large businesses in Scotland who are here all the time - they travel extensively, they might have a home in London or abroad as well as in Scotland, almost certainly some of their family will live outside Scotland.

Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing.

If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes.

But credit where itrsquos due.There was a sense of irony, then, when later that same day Transport Secretary Michael Matheson announced he will end ScotRail operator Abelliorsquos contract three years early, in . The Dutch operator, which took over the ScotRail franchise in , made big promises about train and service improvements up and down the network, from the West Highlands to the Borders. But its performance record has been woeful, with staffing issues in particular seemingly crippling the network, leading to delays, cancellations and overcrowding.Read more:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractNot all of these things were Abelliorsquos fault, however. The fragmented nature of the network since privatisation in , which sees the tracks owned by one company, the trains by another, leased to a third to operate, means ScotRail takes the blame for problems ndash signalling, bad weather, leaves on the line etc ndash it has no control over. But thatrsquos the way it goes. Understandably. frustrated passengers hit out at whoever is closest to hand, and that tends to be ScotRail and its staff.The blame game is an increasingly important part of running or overseeing a railway network, especially when passengers can take to social media social and complain in real time. So, although Abellio clearly failed to meet many of its targets, I donrsquot doubt that public pressure also played a part in the decision to end the contract early.And thatrsquos why Irsquom surprised Mr Matheson seems so keen on bringing ScotRail back into public hands, having already mooted setting up a public operator to bid against private sector rivals for the ScotRail contract. What makes him think the public sector will automatically do a better job than the likes of Abellio, which is itself owned by the Dutch state  Especially when itrsquos clear having control of the franchise is only part of the equation.

Even with a record turnout in , the number was five per cent short.To me this is the SNPrsquos biggest stumbling block.Willie Towers, Alford.IN an otherwise excellent article Alison Rowatappears to accept at face value the assertion that Tony Blair is accurate in his analysis of why Labour lost the  General Election. In fact Labour gained signicantly more votes in  than it did in  , , and . In  Jeremy Corbyn managed to attract ,, votes whereas in  Mr Blair got ,, votes.The problem for the Labour Party and indeed all of the opposition parties is that under the first past the post electoral system the Tories managed to hold on to their share of the vote from  and slightly increase this by entering into an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. The Brexit Party stood down all of their candidates in Tory-held seats which ensured that they held on to these despite a four per cent increase in vote share by the LibDems.The fact is that had Labour, the LibDems, and SNP agreed a similar electoral pact with each other by standing down candidates in their respective target seats they would undoubtedly have reversed the result of this election. In this scenario the Tories would have lost  seats to the combined opposition resulting in another hung parliament. In Scotland such an electoral pact would probably have resulted in the SNP taking three further seats from the Tories, including the seats of Alister Jack and David Mundell. Instead of ruminating over the consequences of a Tory-hard Brexit we would now be discussing how the coalition Labour LibDem SNP government was about to bring forward plans to hold a second EU referendum.All of the opposition partiesneed to learn from this defeat that in politics as in le cooperation against a common enemy is essentialvictory is to be achieved.John Smith, Dunblane.FOR some Christians the Christmas story is a myth, what matters being not that it is a factual account of historical events, but that it is a telling of the truths of the human condition. We believe it to be the very human story of a child born into the squalid conditions of poverty and homelessness, into a family of migrants. There are seemingly deliberate reminders of those at the margins of society with the presence of the shepherds, impoverished outcasts of their day.Our st century story is one of increasing homelessness, of more children growing up in poverty, of migrants made to feel unwelcome in spite of their contribution to our society and refugees fleeing hunger, destruction and persecution being shown insufficient compassion.

Support for independence hasnrsquot changed much, but neither has support for remaining in the UK and that means therersquos a good risk of Yes losing in . In private, many senior figures in the Scottish Government accept the only comfortable referendum will be when the polls are showing around % for Yes for at least a year. And many unionists would agree with that: % would be a ldquosettled will ndash   is not.:Letters: The SNP surely cannot be so lucky next timeThere are other reasons to doubt the SNPrsquos insistence on . We know some of their strategists think allowing Brexit to bite for a few years could drive middle-class Remainers to Yes. We also know the FM is asking for a  referendumin the knowledge a Tory No will be sent up from London, England, and in the hope the Tory No will build resentment in time for a referendum she has a better chance of winning.Question two: Do you honestly think the election result is a mandate for the referendum Here is what ldquoScotlandrsquos Right to Choose says about the SNPrsquos mandate: ldquothe people of Scotland have voted on manestos containing pledges on an independence referendum, and have elected a Scottish Parliament where a majority of the MSPs support such a referendum. It also says the current mandate was reinforced by the recent General Election.But is anyone buying that, particularly from a party that has always objected to the flaws in the UKrsquos electoral system  The Scottish Government says that ldquofor  of the  years since  hellip Scotland has been ruled by governments elected by fewer than half of Scottish constituencies. True. But you could just as easily say Scotland is ruled by an SNP government thatrsquos supported by less than half the Scottish electorate. You could also say the SNP won % of the Scottish constituencies at the general election even though they attracted only % of the vote.The point is that our flawed system is usually an inaccurate reflection of opinion, and yet the Scottish Government is behaving asitrsquos Gospel. As I said last week, thousands of unionist Scots voted SNP at the general election because they wanted Brexit stopped and their votes do not count as support for a second referendum .:Nicola Sturgeon demands permanent referendum power for HolyroodThe bottom line  I think most Scots would accept a referendumthere was evidence of a settled will, as there was in the s for devolution. But the number of constituencies a party has in a flawed system is not a good or definitive measure of public opinion, especially on something as important as the constitution. A flawed system produces a flawed mandate.Question three: Do you accept that Scotland leaving the UK could be harder than the UK leaving the EU The Scottish Governmentrsquos document says a vote for independence in  would allow the smoothest transition to an independent Scotland taking its place as a member of the EU. Ah yes. Smooth transitions. Open borders. The easiest trade deal in human history. See how easily the slogans of Brexiters become the slogans of Scottish nationalists.The reality is that Scexit looks way trickier than Brexit. The UK is a sovereign state which means it can leave the EU without having to decide its currency it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies.The same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make many choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit ndash on shared assets and debts for instance. All of this means Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the European Union.And thatrsquos before we talk about the border. The UK is going to be out of the single market and may restrict EU immigration. An independent Scotland, on the other hand, would be in the EU and would follow the four freedoms, including freedom of movement. Therefore, there would have to be checks at the Scottish border and no amount of Brexit-style reassurance from the Scottish Government is going to change that.And finally: do you believe a close result in a second independence referendum would be accepted as legitimate in Scotland A little bit more from Scotlandrsquos Right to Choose: ldquoWe are committed to an agreed, legal process hellip which will be accepted as legitimate in Scotland, the UK as a whole, and by the international community.Fair enough.

Brexit has taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin ndash ision, bitterness, chaos, anger, and the losers push for another vote ndash and thatrsquos surely what would happen after a Scottish referendum next year, especially with the polls as they are.

Led by Milton Friedman, and known as the Chicago Boys, they set about defining what makes a thriving economy. Low regulation, privatisation and the rolling back of the public sphere. Crucially, this would be an global project to be implemented by the International Monetary Fund, among others.This brand of rampant capitalism,which has come to be known as neoliberalism, was exported with profound and long-lasting consequences, and often through the use of force, and anti-democratic coercion.For Friedman and his ideological acolytes who became hegemonic in the s and s, greed was in reality the organising principle of the corporation, the executive, the shareholder and indeed all iniduals. In this way the sole purpose ndash the only task ndash of a corporate executive was to enrich their shareholders.In a wide-ranging critique of Friedman and the political representatives of the Chicago Boys who triumphed in the s and set the economic consensus for the ensuing decades ndash Thatcher and Reagan ndash Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr Joseph Stiglitz argues that this approach has been socially and economically disastrous.For Stiglitz, who disagreed but never the less respected Friedman, the approach led to intolerablelevels of inequality.

So the logic needs to be accompanied by something a little more doctrinaire.After all, when CEOs earn  times as much as their employees, a great deal of ideological pressure is needed to make this reality as sustainable one.That the Amazon is being cut down, or that Amazon workers earn pennies in comparison to its anti-union CEO: these can simply be rationalised as moral economic incentives that deliver for shareholders andfor society as a whole as wealth ldquotrickles down.Perhaps consumer capitalism is what people really want and that is really what defines us as human beingsndash like it or not.

Wersquove all ndash apparently ndash accepted our entry into a competition for the latest gadgets, cars or clothes. Especially at Christmas time.Little wonder then, that a recent YouGov poll showed that over a third of people were planning on taking out lines of credit to cover festive shopping. It is a quite dizzying cycle. One day the adverts are for the latest must-have products. The next about how much lower in price those products are in the New Year sales. And then, finally, we get the ads for debt helplines.And do we even want le to be commodied in this way  Last year a survey found that in the UK there were around  million unwanted gts. Perhaps thatrsquos this biggest trick of all. All of these products we are told we need, all of the ldquogreed is good dogma, and all of the short-term accumulation of profit doesnrsquot make us happy. In reality it does the opposite.It makes us anxious, adds to our economic stress, and damages our mental health. The never ending slew of useless consumer goods produces fantastic wealth, which is then systematically held back from society at large, often funnelled into off-shore accounts.In the US ndash international headquarters of the Chicago Boys ndash the greed-is-good logic is alive and well. What do General Motors, Netflix, Starbucks and Chevron all have in common  None of them paid a dollar in federal income tax last year. While millions will be worrying about the impossibility of affording health insurance this festive season.Such a social and economic system breeds a culture of inidualism, where the end of society, unless there is a photo-opportunity at a food bank, is finally realised. Fear and ision comes to trump solidarity and hope.But maybe that is just what we are meant to believe. Irsquove never bought into such a pessimistic view of humanity. Indeed ndash despite political events ndash Irsquom sure that the longing for sharing, looking after one an other, and community will overcome the ravages of late capitalism.This year, Glaswegians donated pound, worth of gts for over , children living at the sharp end of austerity and poverty. Foodbank drives are inundated, and the Clutha is opening its doors on Christmas Day for those who are without company, or homes. Thousands of acts of solidarity will take place this Christmas, none of them with monetary reward.Our society and our humanity is worth much more than that. So as this year comes to a close, and we look ahead to dficult times to come ndash for people and for the planet ndash never give up hope in our capacity for compassion. Nor, in the eventual victory of solidarity over greed. The coming years will need acts of kindness, support and yes ndash joy ndash as well as a clear sighted challenge to the economic doctrines that have passed their sell-by date."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-return-little-women","story":"Whorsquos in the new movie Meryl Streep and Laura Dern head-up the latest movie version of the classic American novel, that also features Emma Watson and Saoirse Ronan.Itrsquos not the first time itrsquos been on the big screen This is in fact the eighth film adaptation, with previous reworkings including a TV mini-series in  starring Maya Hawke that aired on BBC One, a  movie, starring Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale, and a  film featuring Katharine Hepburn.The new moviersquos already a hit It has been critically acclaimed in the United States, with the American Film Institute declaring it one of the top  films of  and the Hollywood Foreign Press granting it two nominations for the upcoming Golden Globes, including Best Actress in a Motion Picture for Miss Ronan, who plays the main character, Jo March.Its a true story Author Louisa May Alcott was inspired by her own childhood, as the semi-autobiographical Little Women tells the tale of the impoverished March sisters, Meg, Beth, Amy and Jo who live with their mother in New England while their father is working as a pastor in the American Civil War.

Whatrsquos sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and a simple majority should be allowed to win the next independence referendum using the same rules as those employed by the UK Government to drag Scotland out of the EU against its collective will.Dennis White, Lanark.YOU publish a letter from Stefan Slater in which he puts forward a view thatthere is ever to be another referendum on Scottish independence then the threshold for leaving the UK should be set at a two-thirds majority.I take the view that referendums have no place in our democracy as they are a blunt instrument and a cop-out for those iniduals we elect and remunerate handsomely to make decisions on a plethora of issues andwe disagree with their judgments we can show our displeasure at the ballot box.However, being realistic it seems we are on a path whereby the referendum will come into play more and more, so the suggestion by Mr Slater seems reasonable with an important caveat.Voting must be legislated to be compulsory and no longer should it be acceptable for circa  to  per cent of the electorate to abrogate their civic duty. As is the case for example in Australia, the electorate must either cast a postal ballot or attend a polling station or face a financial penalty ... spoiling your paper is quite acceptable but apathy is not.If implemented them any result achieved could truly be claimed to be the democratic will of the people.James Martin, Bearsden.IAN W Thomsonflags up some negative headlines for the SNP in The Herald over recent weeks and suggests that come the next Holyrood elections the SNP wont be \"so lucky\" and will be hoping for \"some kind of amnesia\" to afflict the electorate. However, as the SNP won  per cent of the seats at this months General Election, and as Nicola Sturgeon won  per cent of the vote in The Heralds own poll which which leader won the Scottish Leaders Debate, I think it highly unlikely that the Scottish voting public will be displaying any signs of amnesia next time they visit the polling stations and I doubtthey will forget that among many other achievements it is the SNP government which has delivered baby boxes, extra free childcare, free university tuition, free prescriptions, free personal care for those in need, regardless of age.The electorate know that the SNP is committed to putting Scotlands future in Scotlands hands, unlike the Tories who disdainfully ignore Scotlands clear vote to remain within the European Union, unlike Labours muddled policy on the EU which saw its votes melt in the sun, and unlike the LibDems and their two-faced position of being in favour of a second referendum on Europe, but denying a second vote on Scottish Independence. The SNPs success in winning this General Election in Scotland, as well as the two previous General Elections, the European elections last May, and the last three Scottish Parliament elections is nothing to do with luck, and everything to do with delivering for Scotland and honouring the wishes of Scotlands voters.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NICOLA Sturgeon insists her call for the right to hold a second independence referendum is now ldquounarguable. Yet when the  Scottish independence referendum was agreed it had the benefit of cross-party support, wide backing amongst the public wherever they actually stood on the issue of independence, and of course UK Government approval through the Edinburgh Agreement. The current strident demand for a rerun of the referendum has none of those benefits, and no prospect of that changing anytime soon.The calls for indyref come solely from the independence movement, and primarily from an SNP leadership desperate to maintain the momentum of its grievance driven agenda.Keith Howell, West Linton.NICOLA Sturgeonrsquos latest beef is that she has a mandate for a new referendum whereas Boris Johnson does not have a mandate for Brexit. She should consider the facts before whingeing about this: Mr Johnson is acting on the basis of a referendum result in which he was on the winning side Ms Sturgeonrsquos party demanded a referendum and lost it. It is clear which of them has a mandate, and it is not Ms Sturgeon. I write as a Remainer .Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD respectfully remind Brian McMillanthat, while Brexiters of all shades are constantly ramming down our throats that the UK voted to leave the EU, almost every second voter entering the polling station in June  voted to Remain. In the  independence referendum, a sizeable minorityvoted Yes but this doesnt stop No supporters from continually telling us the Scotland voted to remain in the UK. Im afraid that Mr McMillan is going to have to accept that these isions are real and here and unlikely to go away in the foreseeable future, despite Boris Johnsons view that we should all now move on and live in harmony.Jim Leslie, East Kilbride.ITS only a matter of weeks ago that Prime Minister Johnson was suffering among the biggest Commons defeats ever recorded: now he has a substantial majority, a weak and ideological split official opposition party, and he is crowing loudly on his dung heap. This is all on the back of the small margin of an increase in the Tory vote of . per cent, hardly a huge public endorsement of his policies. While we must wait a while to see how Mr Johnsonrsquos ldquopromises play out, I suspect another one per centwill be cheering loudest, and the new Tory ldquoBlue Wall in the north of England may find they have bought the proverbial ldquopig in a poke.But he is pressuring Channel  and the BBC, threatening to interfere in the judicial system, making voting more dficult and misrepresenting England as the UK. That small margin of one per cent is allowing him to dig in for the long run, and as we see with Donald Trump, may be dficult to dislodge.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon is on record as saying the time for another referendum would be when the polls showed  per cent in favour over a sustained period. This is because she knows thatshe loses again that it is game over for decades. The reality is she doesnrsquot want another referendum soon as the polls consistently hover around  per cent. All her strident demands are being made for two reasons. The first is to keep her supporters buoyed up and the second is that she will be able to use the inevitable refusal to hold a referendum from Boris Johnson as an excuse to scream and shout about the poor downtrodden Scots, hoping to stir up anti Westminster feelings in Scotland.She constantly refers to the people of Scotland being dragged out of the EU against their will. Twenty-eight out of  Scottish council areas voted No to independence in  with my own area, East Lothian, voting  per cent No. Are we all to be dragged out of the UK against our will Donald Lewis, Gford.AS a director of a not-for-profit community sports club I am required to be a part of an interview  to select employees. If on doing due diligence on the applicants and verying their CV we find a history of racist comments and lying causing the loss of virtually every previous job, we would not be acting with corporate responsibilitywe included them on the short list. If we were foolish or incompetent enough to appoint such a person we would be hauled over the coals by stakeholders and rightly so.However when we translate the scenario to a national level this is exactly what the voters of England have done. I have heard the excuse \"But I like Boris\" and that is fine. Most of us know a lovable rogue but we would never consider putting them in charge of our finances. To quote Malcolm X, who  years ago said: \"If you arent careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing\". How prescient.David Stubley, Prestwick.SINCE the election, there have been lots of strong feelings and Scottish independence crops up a lot.There was a wave of Scottish nationalism after the war. Huge meetings in Glasgow, and one heard about Naomi Mithison and Wendy Wood.I was  and thought there was confusion in that ordinary people were reacting in a way that SNP leaders seemed to ignore. We all though ldquoOh good, an independent Scotland would be a socialist Scotland.But SNP leaders never said this and still donrsquot. For many of us, all we want to know about anybodyrsquos politics is how right or left they are. SNP people never tell you, and so I have no interest in anything they say.The first Scottish assembly in Edinburgh had a Labour majority and we thought it would stay like that. Then they changed to SNP majorities, no good to me.None of them ever say whether they are left or right-wing.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Smales said: “We’re delighted to be able to bring one of our hi-tech taps to Kirkwall, rounding off our first full year of installing Top up Taps across Scotland.#We want to make it easier for Orcadians and visitors to stay hydrated on the go and enjoy our great tasting water whenever they are out and about.“We’re encouraging everybody to top up from the tap as much as possible and get into the habit of carrying a refillable bottle with them when they leave the house. As well as the health benefits of drinking more water, it also saves you money and helps reduce waste.”Since the first tap was launched in Edinburgh in October , more than , litres of water has been drunk from Scottish Water’s expanding collection of Top Up Taps — the equivalent of , standard ml single-use plastic bottles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Instead the overcast sky and sodden turf served to make her pensive mood more sullen. Then it happened. The moment that changed her Christmas beyond all her most fevered wishes…“First Minister, there’s a call for you,” said her Deputy Permanent Secretary, “it’s the Prime minister, he wishes to speak to you with some urgency.” “Really  Whatever for  He’s already made his sham post-election courtesy call. Unless he’s offering me an independence referendum I’d rather be at the dentists or in AE than speak to him again.” The First Minister’s contempt for Boris Johnson was biting.The DPS did not relent, however. “His Permanent Secretary was most insistent and said he would put the Prime Minister through immediately, he’s holding on the line now”.“Oh, all right then, I’ll take it in the drawing room, but make sure it’s recorded, I’m not having him saying one thing to me and leaking a dferent story to the English media.”She strode off to her favourite antique sofa, sat down and picked up the receiver, “First Minister here”, she said in an intentionally clipped tone asshe had been rudely disturbed.“Good morning First Minister, I am so glad we can speak, I have some serious news I must impart to you before anyone other. I do so hope it will make your Christmas brighter and bring great jollity at this joyous time of year,” said Prime Minister Johnson.Indferent already, the First Minister decided to be curt in reply, “I don’t have a great deal of time, I was just going to do some last minute Christmas shopping…”But before she could say anymore the Prime Minster spoke over her, “I’ve decided to be your personal Father Christmas. I received your letter to Santa, that formal request for a Section  Order, and after some more thought, I’ve discussed it with my Cabinet and it is agreed. You can have your Christmas wish, you can have the referendum. The procedures are already in hand and I shall be announcing it to the country immediately after this call.”Sturgeon was for once, momentarily lost for words. The pause was interrupted only by Boris Johnson saying, “First Minister, are you still there, did you hear me, I am agreeing to your request for a referendum.”Full of mixed emotions ranging from bewilderment to anger, and worry to puzzlement, Sturgeon gathered herself. There must be more to this she mused only last Friday Johnson had called and ruled out any referendum, so why the change of heart, was there a concealed plan  There’s always a concealed plan, she thought, for she always concealed her own intentions behind a wall of spin and knew Johnson did the same.“Well it’s good to know you now see things my way,” she said “the Scottish people demanded a referendum in the general election and it’s only right we should have the choice to decide to have one.” She chose her words carefully but they still came out through gritted teeth. Sturgeon did not want a referendum at all, her real wish was to nurse a sense of grievance about being denied a referendum. Johnson knew her game and Sturgeon now knew Johnson knew it. He was calling her bluff and enjoying the moment almost as much as hearing the election night’s exit poll that told him he had won. Sturgeon would now have to find ways of delaying the actual vote until after the Holyrood elections in , and would have to find some new grievances, and fast.“Oh don’t misunderstand me First Minister” Johnson went on. “When I say there shall be a referendum I mean of course I am recommending it be held under the strictest of terms. Such a constitutional matter is reserved to Westminster and I shall be announcing it must take place within the next six months so there is an end to constitutional wrangling and you can get on with the day job.”“Now that we are getting Brexit done I am intent on healing the country’s deep wounds. I want to build one nation in harmony and at peace with itself. We cannot go on being set against each other – and that requires me to address your wish for Scottish succession that ides Scotland, as much as it needs me to heal the Brexit ide across the UK”“Accordingly we must have the Scottish referendum by May next year and it will be based upon the register used for the general election. All Scots, by which I mean those people living in the rest of the UK or around the world who can show they were on the Scottish general election register in the last fteen years, will be entitled to a postal vote. I’m sure you will agree it is important that as many Scots are given the franchise in such an important decision.”“The question will be set by the Electoral Commission using the terms to “leave or remain” in the United Kingdom, as that phrasing is known to be the least pejorative and most balanced.” Prime Minister Johnson paused to let the First Minister respond.“I don’t find those arrangements at all acceptable, we shall not submit to any imposition. My Scottish Government shall decide who votes on what question and when.” Sturgeon said in full-blown anger, her face screwing up as she spat the words out. Her fists had instinctively clenched and the pencil in her right hand snapped.The Prime Minister was ready for this and replied, “As I said, I am announcing my decision to the country from Downing Street in a few minutes. If you wish to reject this very fair offer that can allow the Scottish people to move on from bitter ision and rancour it will be on your head. I shall leave it for Scots to judgeyou have the people or only your party at heart. Have a Merry Christmas.” The line went dead.It was now pouring outside Bute House.

Whether it’s cheesy festive tunes on the radio, TV adverts trying to sell you the perfect gt or a Christmas tree twinkling in a neighbour’s window, there is no getting away from reminders of seasonal cheer.But for so many older people, Christmas is anything but cheerful. Maybe this was the year they lost a beloved spouse and face Christmas alone for the first time. Or their daughter is visiting her in-laws so they won’t see her or the grandchildren again this year. Or December  is just like every other day, spent in the company of the TV without a phone call or a visit but, more acutely painful, because everyone  appears to be celebrating with family and friends.Around , older people in Scotland say Christmas is the loneliest time of the year. The festive holiday, with its emphasis on cosy family gatherings, brings back memories of happier times, spent with family and friends who are no longer around.: Scotsman launches campaign to tackle loneliness – leader comment: Loneliness kills: experts say isolation can be fatalAge Scotland research has found at least , of over-s in Scotland will sit down to dinner alone on Christmas Day. That’s more than twice the capacity of Hampden Park. A quarter of those asked in a survey admitted they were not looking forward to the festive season and one in ten will spend the day on their own.This is more than a set of sad statistics. Loneliness kills. It is a public health epidemic which is as dangerous to a person’s health as smoking  cigarettes a day. It increases the risk of stress, heart disease, anxiety and depression and doubles the risk of developing dementia.Stoically endured lonelinessPeople who are lonely or have few social interactions are predicted to be more at risk of suicide, more likely to suffer falls and have a  per cent increased risk of mortality. And as our population ages, faster in Scotland than the rest of the UK, it is becoming a crisis.Loneliness can affect anyone of any age, but older people who have experienced bereavement, retirement, ill health or children moving away are particularly vulnerable. The over-s are among the worst affected, with  per cent saying they dreaded Christmas. They are also the age group most likely to be widowed or live alone.What is stoically endured for the rest of the year is brought into sharp focus when everyone  seems to be surrounded by loved ones.Loneliness is a widespread but well-hidden problem. There is still a stigma about being isolated that prevents people asking for help. Age Scotland estimates that there’s at least one chronically lonely older person living on every street in Scotland.It’s easy to feel helpless when confronted by the scale of problem. But there are opportunities to help. Age Scotland’s Share What You Love campaign invites people to commit to spending time with an older person to share a hobby, a meal or even a favourite TV show.Across the country, older people’s groups, supported by Age Scotland, are doing great work organising lunch clubs, music appreciation groups and dementia-friendly gatherings. The volunteers who run these groups play a vital role in reaching out to older people on their own and drawing them back into the heart of their communities.Chatty ChairsMen’s Sheds are another initiative giving older people a place to meet, share their skills, have a chat and a coffee. Regular “shedders” say they feel less isolated since joining their local Men’s Shed. In Jedburgh, the team from the Jed Shed has come up with a simple but effective way to encourage people to talk. They have put a bench in front of the town’s historic abbey with a plaque that reads Happy to Chat. Anyone who fancies a natter can sit down and enjoy some company.A similar venture in Glasgow’s intu Braehead Shopping Centre, which offers Chatty Chairs for older people who want to sit down and talk to someone, has proved popular with shoppers.Our helpline and Community Connecting service can offer free advice and support to older people wanting to spend time with like-minded groups. The helpline is also available for the families of older people, to give information that might assist an isolated relative reluctant to seek help for themselves. There are plenty of ways Scotsman readers can help too. Striking up a friendly conversation with an older person at a bus stop can make someone’s day. Pop in to see an older neighbour who lives alone, just for a cup of tea or offer to pick up shopping for them. At this time of year, many older people are confined to their homes because of bad weather and so little daylight. Even getting to the shops in winter can be an ordeal for older people and by the time spring comes around, they have got out of the habit of leaving the house.Volunteering is another great way to get involved. Our Age Scotland volunteers work across the country, bringing older people together and fostering a sense of among isolated iniduals. We are delighted that The Scotsman has joined Age Scotland’s campaign to shine a light on this problem at Christmas. But it is important to remember loneliness doesn’t disappear on Boxing Day.Let’s make  the year of connecting with isolated older people in all our communities.for the Share What You Love campaign – and tell us what you enjoy doing with your older friend. Working together, we can help to tackle the scourge of loneliness.Brian Sloan is chief executive of Age Scotland.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter.

If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"belfast woman jacqueline kavanagh spending christmas battling seas around australia","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One suggestion is to make it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.Mr Eastwood believes politicians minds should be focused on nurses giving up their Christmas with their families to care for patients, families worried about welfare cuts and young people who have left Northern Ireland for better prospects.\"Christmas offers us a moment to reflect on the year thats passing and how we, as political leaders, have sought to improve the lives of people across the north,\" he said.\"Our minds should be focused on the nurses and health service staff who will again give up Christmas with their families to care for those in need.\"Theyll do so under immense pressure and without pay parity this year. We can do better for them.\"We should be called to act for the most vulnerable, struggling to provide for their families, who face the loss of welfare mitigations in a few months. We should do better for them,\" the Foyle MP added.\"And we should yearn to stem the flow of talented young people from our shores, leaving empty seats at Christmas tables across our communities, because theyve been forced to seek opportunity where. We must do better for them.\"Mr Eastwood said January will mark three years since the collapse of Stormont and political parties have an opportunity to restore not just the Executive but the publics faith in politicians.\"If this moment passes us by, it will be a long time before we get another,\" he said.\"The SDLP will do everything in our power to secure a resolution that delivers for public sector workers, resources our hospitals and schools, provides opportunity and hope to our young people and defends the most vulnerable.\"Meanwhile, Mrs ONeill said that Sinn Fein is committed to the restoration of the political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement on the basis of equality and respect.\"There is a real opportunity to successfully conclude the talks and have a sitting Assembly and Executive to address the crisis in our health and public services,\" she said.\"Progress and resolution is imperative. There is an overwhelming appetite in the public for good government formed without further delay.\"Sinn Feins focus is firmly on achieving an agreement to the outstanding issues and getting the political institutions back up and running and working for everyone in the new year,\" the MLA added."},{"url":null,"title":"numbers of people accessing methadone up 600 in 10 years in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a number of reasons,” he said.“Firstly they show that more and more people are seeking treatment for heroin addiction, which is positive, but they also show up the failure in drugs policy to trying to get iniduals into treatment programmes.“There is simply not enough resources being put into the services a recovering addict needs, le skills, counselling to address underlying mental health issues

one addiction with another and some addicts will argue that methadone is harder to detox from than Heroin.“You’ll also note that the age profile of those on methadone is rising indicating that people are on methadone years and not enough is being done to help iniduals beat their addiction.”Dr Garrett McGovern, an addiction specialist in Priority Medical Clinic, says that the numbers of those using

bpanews_feb-ea-f-d-aabb_EmailChimpanzees have a sense of rhythm and like to move to the beat, according to a new study..pushScientists have found that listening to music prompts the primates to perform rhythmic movements such as swaying, hand-clapping and foot-tapping.The researchers say that understanding more about the predisposition of these great apes to music could shed light on how humans came to appreciate melodies.Dr Yuko Hattori and professor Masaki Tomonaga, of Kyoto University in Japan, studied seven chimpanzees who were exposed to six two-minute piano compositions for six days.They found that while the music was being played, the chimps swayed their bodies and bobbed their heads and, sometimes, went as far as clapping their hands and tapping their feet.The team also found that male chimpanzees were more likely to respond to the tunes by being more vocal and swaying rhythmically for longer durations compared with their female counterparts.In their paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers noted: “Given that humans do not have such a sex dference in musical ability, higher sensitivity to sound in male chimpanzees may have been acquired after chimpanzees erged from the common ancestor shared with humans.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A male chimpanzee making a rhythmic display at the enclosure in the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University “This may also be associated with their patriarchal society, where male chimpanzees often collaborate to protect their territory and group members.”To understand more about their musical inclination, the researchers selected the chimpanzee most responsive to the music.They then exposed the animal, called Akira, to additional musical sessions, with four two-minute experiences for  days.The researchers found that both random and regular beats induced rhythmic swaying in Akira.The movements were more pronounced when Akira was standing on two feet rather than on all fours, which the researchers believe could be down to the chimpanzee having a greater flexibility in the bipedal posture.In addition, Akira also stayed longer in the area where music was playing, indicating that the chimpanzee actively sought musical stimulation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The chimpanzee enclosure at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University According to the authors, the findings point to a foundation for dancing in a common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.The team wrote in the paper: “In humans, listening to music induces rhythmic movement, suggesting a close connection between the auditory and motor areas in the brain.“These results suggest that prerequisites for music and dance are deeply rooted and existed in the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, approximately six million years ago.”Meanwhile, in a separate study also published in Pnas, scientists have found that chimpanzees share tools with each other and teach their fellow beings new skills so they are able to perform complex and challenging food-hunting tasks.Researchers in the US say that this act of sharing tools and skills in chimpanzees is similar to that seen in humans."},{"url":null,"title":"monkeys enjoy specially baked mince pies ahead of christmas at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Most of the Christmas Eve visitors appeared to be local residents, with foreign pilgrims seeming to make up a modest portion of the crowd.Still, the celebrations capped the most successful year in history for Palestinian tourism, according to tourism minister Rula Maayah.Bethlehem, located just outside of Jerusalem, has invested heavily in tourism. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A Palestinian Scout marching band parades during Christmas celebrations It has built new hotels and tried to ersy itself by offering culinary and cultural destinations in addition to its traditional holy sites.Ms Maayah estimated that some , pilgrims were staying overnight in Bethlehem’s fully booked hotels this Christmas. Tourists were also staying in other West Bank towns, such as Ramallah and Jericho, in addition to Jerusalem.In all, she said the number of foreign tourists visiting the West Bank this year is estimated to reach . million people, up from  million last year.Christmas festivities are typically a boost for Bethlehem’s flagging economy and for the Holy Land’s dwindling Christian population, which has shrunk over the decades as people fled conflict and searched for better opportunities abroad.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Christian pilgrims from Nigeria pray inside the Grotto of the Church of the Nativity “Our message this year is that Christmas is a message of joy,” Ms Maayah said. “But of course we are celebrating Christmas while we are still under occupation. “We hope that we will celebrate Christmas joyfully next year with the end of occupation so that we could celebrate like all other nations in our independent country without occupation.”The Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born, was set to host Palestinian dignitaries and pilgrims from around the world for a midnight Mass.Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the head Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, had crossed an Israeli army checkpoint from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, where he was greeted by prominent members of Bethlehem’s Christian community.

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service.

Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area.

It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb.

Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork.

In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord.

Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast.

In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

Will you get to write to everybody in time Probably not, but the great thing about the magic of Christmas is that I can see every letter written to Santa, eventhe children forget to put it in the post. Will you be hungry I am always hungry with having to travel all around the world. Sometimes I get a chance to get a little bite to eat, but a glass of milk and a sandwich is always great. I have been told by Mrs Claus to keep off the sweets, but maybe just one or two. Rudolph says that the reindeers are happy with some water and maybe a carrot, but don’t worry, as they are all well fed before they leave the North Pole. Last words to the children of Derry Make sure and be on your best behaviour. Listen to your parent or parents and remember that some presents are so very expensive, but please enjoy the ones you get. I have seen children in Africa and other poorer countries, who are not as lucky as the children in Derry.And always remember that there are other children out in the world less well off than you.  Ho! Ho! Ho! and a big Happy Christmas to all the readers and advertisers of Derry Now.  May  bring you lots of joy, happiness and good health.

This time of year is always one for reflection, and as I look back on  I do so with a sense of pride at serving as your Mayor for the last six months, particularly as the first person from Strabane town to do so. I have experienced so much in my political career, but this has been – and continues to be – one of the most rewarding and enjoyable roles that I have ever held. From when I first took on the Mayoral chain in May, I have had the pleasure of taking part in engagements across our entire District, and even further afield. In those many engagements I have met new faces aplenty from our community groups, schools, charities and all the local organisations who make a positive contribution to our society. So many times I have sat back in awe of the talented, kind, inspiring people that we have here, and that have allowed Derry and Strabane to keep growing as somewhere we are proud to call home. These are people who do so without want for praise, who work tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, and I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to them. We have continued to embrace ersity, and all cultures, ages, religions and orientations have been celebrated this year. A particular highlight for me has been engaging with both the younger and older members of our District. I have visited several of our primary and secondary schools and seen for myself the many wonderful young people with whom our future is in very safe hands, while my regular Mayor’s Tea Dances have been thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve heard so many stories, had so many laughs, and enjoyed a few spins and twirls on the dancefloor along the way!Another element of great pride for me has been the money raised for my two chosen Mayor’s charities – Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre, Strabane. They are two charities close to my heart and representing issues – women’s rights and mental health – that I feel are very prevalent in our society. I have always tried, and will continue to try, to raise awareness of the wonderful work that they both do, and it brings me real joy to know that it has made a positive impact for them. Once againm  has been an award-winning year for the District, with Brooke Park given the prestigious ‘Green Flag’ status for the third year running, while, for the first time, we were victorious in winning the Small City category at the Britain in Bloom awards. Congratulations to everyone who helped us achieve those successes, they were certainly well-deserved. On a regeneration front we have continued to move in a positive direction. In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This time of year is always one for reflection, and as I look back on  I do so with a sense of pride at serving as your Mayor for the last six months, particularly as the first person from Strabane town to do so. I have experienced so much in my political career, but this has been – and continues to be – one of the most rewarding and enjoyable roles that I have ever held. From when I first took on the Mayoral chain in May, I have had the pleasure of taking part in engagements across our entire District, and even further afield. In those many engagements I have met new faces aplenty from our community groups, schools, charities and all the local organisations who make a positive contribution to our society. So many times I have sat back in awe of the talented, kind, inspiring people that we have here, and that have allowed Derry and Strabane to keep growing as somewhere we are proud to call home. These are people who do so without want for praise, who work tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, and I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to them. We have continued to embrace ersity, and all cultures, ages, religions and orientations have been celebrated this year. A particular highlight for me has been engaging with both the younger and older members of our District. I have visited several of our primary and secondary schools and seen for myself the many wonderful young people with whom our future is in very safe hands, while my regular Mayor’s Tea Dances have been thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve heard so many stories, had so many laughs, and enjoyed a few spins and twirls on the dancefloor along the way!Another element of great pride for me has been the money raised for my two chosen Mayor’s charities – Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre, Strabane. They are two charities close to my heart and representing issues – women’s rights and mental health – that I feel are very prevalent in our society. I have always tried, and will continue to try, to raise awareness of the wonderful work that they both do, and it brings me real joy to know that it has made a positive impact for them. Once againm  has been an award-winning year for the District, with Brooke Park given the prestigious ‘Green Flag’ status for the third year running, while, for the first time, we were victorious in winning the Small City category at the Britain in Bloom awards. Congratulations to everyone who helped us achieve those successes, they were certainly well-deserved. On a regeneration front we have continued to move in a positive direction. In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates. The site at the Ministry of Defence base will encompass four pitches, a MUGA and an administration and exhibition museum centre.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you. Itrsquos best done before the night is out.ldquoAlso, I say that having a bit of good manners helps, to say thank you and to appreciate what we do for each other..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick man.jpg","title":"Downpatrick man in roll of honour  ","story":"FORMER Downpatrick and Ireland cricket captain Alfie Linehan was included in a prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who died during .He was among  from around the world listed as lsquospecial peoplersquo in BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme broadcast at the weekend.They included England goalkeeper Gordon Banks and racing driver Niki Lauda as well as another cricketer mdash one of Englandrsquos greatest fast bowlers, Bob Willis.Alfie died in June after suffering dementia and contracting cancer.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

They were due to meet the architects this week, but instead were sent a written report on the progress being made.The council clerk, Mr Seamus Byrne, read the report at a council meeting on Monday and said he expected a completion date early in the new year. In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

He said that in the light of the ldquoBrexit catastrophe, people stood up and put the interests of people in the constituency to the fore.Conceding that he expected his vote to decease, the ing MP said that he was delighted to top the poll, highlighting the need to get Stormont up and running again.ldquoIt is important that we have locally devolved institutions.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so. Some of my friends voted SDLP this time which wonrsquot happen in an Assembly election.Mr Brown said many would have suggested that Alliance hit its electoral ceiling in  and firmly believes there is much more to come from his party locally.

And while the roads are comparatively clear of traffic, there are public transport successes too. Some train and bus services around Belfast are so popular that park and ride can barely cope.Employment levels are high, the many restaurants are bustling, and Belfast is a vibrant capital city, that comes into its own with the popular Christmas Market in the centre.The Province is, and has long been, a good place to live and that is why Ulster folk have such a strong attachment to home, and did even during the Troubles.We wish our readers a Merry Christmas and happy new year.

If this is the first time you have subscribed to emails from JPIMedia Ltd, the publishers of Belfast News Letter, please check your inbox to very your email address.  .html.valA Greenisland man will be on duty on Christmas Day helping to operate a charity helpline service.Adrian Somerville, practice manager with the NSPCC adult Helpline, is working at the base in Belfast, along with some of his team. The helpline, which is available on    or email help@nspcc.org.uk, is open throughout the festive period.Adrian said: “Abuse and neglect does not stop just because it is Christmas. Children continue to be at risk over this period and it is essential that the helpline stays open to take calls and online contacts from people who are worried about the well-being of a child or children. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “In emergency situations over the holidays, the NSPCC Helpline shares information with police and children’s services to protect children who may be at immediate risk of harm.It is also important that the helpline remains open given that at Christmas, ongoing situations within families can escalate due to stresses linked to this time of year, which can put children in danger.”The -year-old started working with NSPCC in March  as a Childline volunteer counsellor. Prior to that, he worked in a French customer service team in Belfast because he wanted to make the most of his French and European Politics degree from Queen’s University and then moved to a role in sales. However, after completing a six-month course in counselling at Belfast Met, he realised that this he wanted to change his career path and work as a full-time counsellor.He added: “In June , I qualied as a counsellor and started a new role of helpline practitioner and then was promoted to practice manager with the NSPCC adult Helpline. Before starting to work with the NSPCC, I didn’t know they offered a service to adults who were concerned about children and young people but it’s a vital part of the organisation because it’s a place adults can contact by phone or online to get advice or share their concerns about a child – anonymouslythey wish.”“The team is staffed by professional practitioners with backgrounds in jobs like teaching, healthcare and social work who know how to spot the signs of abuse and what to do to help. Parents and carers also call us with all sorts of questions such as what to do about bullying or how to keep their children safe online while professionals such as teachers and doctorscontact us for information and guidance.”“Other issues we hear about over Christmas includeneglect due to being left home alone, parents being under the influence of alcohol and or drugs whilst having children in their care, or children being exposed to domestic abuse. However, the job is so rewarding because all too often you can hear the sense of relief from our callers because we reassure them that they have done the right thing by getting in touch and voicing their worries and we let them know that action will be taken.”Adrian is looking forward to the festive season but won’t be having his own celebration on Christmas Day because he will be at work.He said: “I am extremely lucky as my husband has always been very understanding, right from the very first time I volunteered to work a sht in Childline on Christmas Day.

Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Search for missing man called off as body recovered from Belfast Lough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"New overdraft rules come into force from today -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
