In 2018 the National Transport Authority (NTA) announced a public consultation and said it would be completed by 2027 if it succeeds at the planning stage.In October this year the Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan stated that he could not guarantee that Link would be finished by 2034.The project was included in the National Development Plan at a cost of at least €3 billion to deliver a “sustainable, safe, efficient, integrated and accessible public transport service between Swords, Dublin Airport and Dublin city centre, but no completion date was included.Speaking at the PAC on Thursday morning, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) chief executive Peter Walsh said that he too could not give a completion date for the projection.The TII is in charge of building transport infrastructure projects in the State.Mr Walsh said €83 million has been spent on the Link project to date on the most recent iteration of the projection. That figure does not include fees relating to the earlier versions of the metro.He estimated that if the Government gives the go-ahead in this quarter, planning permission will be sought in the second quarter.The planning process will take at least two years, it will be followed by a two to 2½ year procurement process and then the construction would take between eight and nine years.“Across north Dublin people have lost complete faith in metro because it is a 20 year saga,” he told the committee.“The people of North Dublin are now facing a situation where at best it will be 2035 for a project which the Government is willing to fund now.“It is hugely frustrating because the Government haven’t made a decision to delay this project by 10 years, but it looks like it will be delayed by 10 years.“Not really,” Mr Walsh responded. “I take your word for you if you are frustrated.”“It is reasonable that people are frustrated by that?” Mr McAuliffe added.“People’s frustration is not something I can really comment on,” Mr Walsh said.Mr McAuliffe reminded Mr Walsh that a timeline for the project was produced in 2018 and TII was supposed to have produced the rail procurement order in the third quarter of 2019, but “failed at the first hurdle”.“Was it a realistic timeline ever or was it not resourced to the point where you could deliver it within that timeframe?” Mr McAuliffe asked.Mr Walsh said the timeline announced in 2018 was “probably optimistic. It has taken time to deal with the issues that needed to be dealt with”.Mr McAuliffe asked him why the TII could not commit to a timeline for the project. Mr Walsh stated the planning process, possible judicial reviews and procurement process were outside the power of his organisation.Mr McAuliffe said in giving no deadline for the project, it would be impossible to hold others to account for it. “It is effectively a doubling of the length of the project. We compounded the disappointment of people by a timeframe that was not realistic.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics politics after the pandemic","story":"Opposition parties are still putting pressure on the Government over the so-called “champagne party” in the Department of Foreign Affairs on the night Ireland was elected to the UN Security Council two years ago, but will the incident have any lasting political impact?

Photograph: Brian LawlessPAFirst Minister of Northern Ireland Paul Givan is expected to announce his resignation by the end of the week, a senior Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) source has said.It comes amid the party’s protest against the Northern Ireland protocol and follows his colleague Edwin Poots’s decision to order a halt to agri-food checks at Northern Ireland’s ports.It is understood that senior DUP figures are meeting later to confirm the timing of Mr Givan’s resignation statement, which could come as early as Thursday, according to PA news agency.The resignation of the First Minister would automatically remove Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill from office.In those circumstances, other ministers in the administration could still remain in place. However, the Executive could not make any significant decisions.That would prevent the coalition from agreeing a three-year budget – a spending plan that is out for public consultation.A planned official state apology by Mr Givan and Ms O’Neill to victims of historic institutional abuse, scheduled for March, may also not happen.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has repeatedly threatened to bring down the Stormont institutions in protest against the so-called Irish Sea border, introduced as part of the post-Brexit protocol.Post-Brexit checksMr Poots issued a unilateral direction on Wednesday evening, instructing officials to stop the agri-food checks at midnight. However, there has been no confirmation from Stormont officials whether they intend to comply with the order.DUP rivals at Stormont insist Mr Poots’s direction is unlawful and civil servants are obliged to follow the law at all times.The European Commission has said the decision by the DUP Minister of Agriculture Mr Poots creates “further uncertainty and unpredictability for businesses and citizens”.An EU spokesperson said: “The European Commission has been working tirelessly with the UK government to address practical challenges related to the implementation of the protocol. The decision by the Northern Irish Minister for Agriculture is therefore unhelpful.“The European Commission will closely monitor developments in Northern Ireland pursuant to this announcement.”Vice-president of the European Commission Maros Sefcovic is due to meet UK foreign secretary Liz Truss on Thursday afternoon to continue talks on the protocol.“He will recall that controls on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain are a key element of the protocol,” the spokesperson said. “They are necessary for Northern Irish business and citizens to continue to benefit from access to the single market for goods. They are also necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.”Belfast PortLorries were still being received at a Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs checking facility in Belfast Port earlier on Thursday morning.Several vehicles entered the facility after the ferry arrived from Cairnryan in Scotland at 6am.A staff member declined to confirm whether the agri-food checks required under the protocol were continuing.The picture is further clouded due to the fact some of the port checks have been delegated to local council staff, while UK Border Force personnel also have a presence at the facilities. It is unclear what would happen to their roles if the agriculture department staff withdrew.Mr Poots’s direction only relates to the sanitary and phytosanitary checks required by the protocol. The customs procedures on Irish Sea trade are unaffected by his instruction.Announcing the move on Wednesday, Mr Poots said legal advice he had sought on the issue supported his view that he was entitled to stop the checks.The UK government has said it will not intervene in what it has characterised as a matter that falls within the Stormont Executive.Government critics dispute this contention, highlighting that the UK has a duty under international law to abide by the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"poots s order to halt post brexit checks breaches international law","story":"The North’s Minister for Agriculture has ordered that post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland’s ports are to be halted from midnight tonight.

Asked if the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) would follow the Minister’s order, a spokesman said: “The Minister has received senior counsel advice and has issued an instruction on that basis.”Lorries were still being received at a Daera checking facility in Belfast Port earlier on Thursday morning. Several vehicles entered the facility after the ferry arrived from Cairnryan in Scotland at 6am.A staff member declined to confirm to the PA news agency whether the Northern Ireland Protocol checks were continuing.Announcing his ordering of a halt to the checks, Mr Poots told reporters on Wednesday that “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval” and therefore the advice “concluded that I can direct the checks to cease”.“I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on December 31st, 2020, from midnight tonight.”He said he would prepare a paper for the Northern Ireland Executive’s consideration “in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward”.Move condemnedThe move was strongly condemned by the Irish Government and by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party, who questioned the legal basis for Mr Poots’s action and said it was more about politics than attempting to find a solution to the issues around the protocol.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said such a move would be “a breach of international law”.He said the protocol was part of an international agreement, and “to deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty would be a very serious matter indeed”.“It would be essentially playing politics with legal obligations,” he said, and urged that the negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the protocol should be allowed to continue.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill described it as a “stunt” and an “attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law”.It is understood the UK government has been in touch with the Northern Executive and is considering the details, including the legal position. A UK government spokesman appeared to indicate it would not seek to intervene, saying “the operation of checks” was a matter for the Executive, adding that there were “significant problems with the protocol which urgently need fixing”.UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is to speak to European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Thursday, the spokesman said."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boriss betrayal revolutionary brexit mandate now almost total","story":"This is the week a Government that began with such promise finally lost its soul. Its great policy relaunch is a tragic mush, proof that it no longer really believes in anything, not even its own self-preservation. Conservative supporters, keen to move on from Partygate, were desperate for a comprehensive package of conservative ideas to enrich the North, relaunch Brexit and pave the way for an electoral resurgence. It was not to be.Michael Gove’s levelling-up blueprint is a grotesque disappointment, a list of buzzwords and targets masquerading as strategy, its pseudo-intellectual veneer and cod history intended to camouflage the fact that it essentially advocates the very same nostrums that ultimately destroyed Labour.A proper conservative approach to levelling-up would focus on schooling, and the heart-breaking results of the white working class. It would investigate family policy and the values crisis. It would create dozens of libertarian pro-business areas, run by development corporations, with almost no taxes and regulation. It would target cheaper energy. It would liberate an extra one per cent of Britain’s landmass for house building. It would tackle the failed monolith that is the NHS. It would not see spending on public transport as a panacea. It would reject targets, subsidies and bureaucracies. It would break with socialism.Instead, Torsten Bell of the Left-wing Resolution Foundation, Britain’s most influential economics think-tank despite our nominally Tory administration, describes Johnsonian levelling up as a fusion between George Osborne and New Labour. “The agenda combines the devolution of the former Conservative Chancellor with the last Labour government’s biggeractivist central state reprioritising spend towards deprived areas”, as he puts it.A central problem is that too many Tories now have a vested interest in pretending that the form of devolution practiced in this country has been a success. This is the very reverse of the truth.Competition between local jurisdictions works, but only if set up correctly. Britain’s flawed model encourages bailouts from Westminster, grants power without fiscal responsibility and encourages municipal socialism. It doesn’t incentivise local leaders to improve competitiveness, or to think carefully enough about spending projects.Eurosceptics were always opposed to Labour’s flawed devolution: The North East Says No campaign, which defeated John Prescott’s devolution drive in 2004, was a dry run for the Brexit referendum, and included figures who went on to work for Vote Leave.The Tories also have not answered a fundamental contradiction: why do they want to make everywhere like London, given that our capital voted Corbyn and Remain? Left to its own devices, London would self-destruct, imposing punitive taxes and chasing away its value-creators. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is at it again, threatening to shut roads and tube services if he isn’t bailed out. We need more Canary Wharfs, created before devolution, and fewer City Halls.In the US, the Republicans don’t want to turn the whole of America into New York or San Francisco – they look instead at Texas or Florida. We need to replicate the brilliant bits of London, its ability to create jobs and wealth, without the socialism and cultural Left-wingery. If the Tories really believed in local accountability, they would break London up into several competing entities, not create yet more dysfunctional, statist, subsidy-hungry, rotten boroughs all over the country.If the establishment technocrats are getting everything they want, the Right has been left with almost nothing, including on Brexit. The scale of the betrayal is staggering. The Brexit white paper is one of the most shameful economic policy documents ever produced by a Conservative government. Margaret Thatcher’s Bruges Speech, Christopher Booker’s Mad Officials, Brian Hindley’s Better Off Out, the Open Europe deregulatory reports, Business for Britain’s Change or Go: all targeted over-regulation. Yet that powerful intellectual movement, built over decades, has virtually zero presence in the Remainers’ Brexit being delivered by Johnson.There have, of course, been major changes on immigration and foreign policy, and the vaccination success would not, in practice, have happened had we been part of the EU. That alone means that it was worth it, though the agricultural reforms are flawed. The decision to allow Hong Kongers to settle would also have been politically impossible had EU free movement still existed.But when it comes to the economy, the Government’s policy barely differs from Theresa May’s Brexit in name only. The authors of the 2016 Treasury attacks on Brexit have triumphed: they argued that there was very little in Britain’s tax, spend and regulatory structure that needed to be changed, and, staggeringly, Johnson’s government now agrees.All of which brings us to energy policy, another case study in extreme failure. A sensible government would urgently accelerate its nuclear plans by creating a powerful agency modelled on the vaccines taskforce. As a temporary solution, such an administration would also push to extract more oil and gas, including by fracking.Instead, a government that no longer believes in markets will now simply pretend that prices are much lower than they are. The Treasury will lend billions to energy companies to allow them to moderate price rises customers will then pay higher bills in the future to ensure the Treasury (hopefully) recoups its money.The furlough and bailouts that accompanied Covid – necessary evils given state-mandated lockdowns – have perverted our politics, undermining self-reliance and normalising handouts.That wail you hear is the cry of Toryland: among the true believers, the long-marchers, the Eurosceptics and the free-marketeers, there is sorrow, anger and despair.

It is the first time a university cancel culture row will be heard in court.The row has seen fellows at Cambridge pitted against academics from Oxford University. Prof Lawrence Goldman, a Jesus alumnus and an Emeritus Fellow in History St Peter\u0027s College, Oxford, opposed Jesus\u0027s application. Opponents have called Prof Nigel Biggar, a Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at Oxford, as a witness.For opponents, attempting to remove the memorial represents an oversimplification of history and denies students the chance to think for themselves.But the college has taken the view that it represents a celebration of Rustat that is incompatible with the chapel as an inclusive community and a place of collective wellbeing.Rustat (1608-1694) was a courtier to Charles II and an investor in the Royal African Company (RAC) and the Company of Royal Adventurers, both slaving enterprises.He commissioned the memorial himself when he was already a significant benefactor to the college.Supporters of retaining the monument, including Dr Goldman, have argued that the totality of his life should be considered, not just his investments in slavery. Among his many other donations was a contribution to the reconstruction of St Paul\u0027s cathedral.Reverend James Crockford, the chapel\u0027s dean, who is responsible for the historic building, believes the memorial is a barrier to (students\u0027) participation in the chapel, the hearing was told.He told the court that there were students who did not attend the chapel because they “find it distressing to enter” and others who attended but “feel disquieted and discomfited by the presence of the memorial”.Being questioned, he was asked Do you think that church should always be a safe space? and he gave an adamant yes.But Justin Gau, the lawyer representing opponents to the memorial\u0027s removal, said: We shouldn\u0027t remove the difficulties life throws at us in a chapel, should we?.Mr Gau also suggested that adding context to the memorial to Rustat would be enough to stop it being distressing to students.For some unchurched undergraduates, he said, seeing images of Jesus, a crucified man, a dead man who had been tortured, might also be disturbing, if they didn\u0027t have the well-known context of Christianity.Mr Gau raised the role of slavery in the Bible, saying: Where, for example, in the gospels is slavery condemned?Were the memorial not to be moved, the Rev Crockford said, some of these students would be a “lot less ready to participate in the life of the chapel” and that it “would do untold damage to reputation of chapel within college” and its role in non-religious events.Historic England has warned that its removal would harm the significance of Jesus College Chapel.In 1671, Rustat donated £2,000 (approx £450,000 in today\u0027s money) to Jesus College for the education of the orphan sons of Anglican clergy.His investment in the Royal African Company is believed to have been £400. He is better known, however, for serving Charles II for 18 years, including in exile in Europe and during the English Civil War.The decision to attempt have the plaque removed came after the college set up a Legacy of Slavery Working Party (LSWP) to pursue critical self-reflection on the long-term legacies of slavery and colonial violence.The group of eight academics and two students recommended that the memorial be contextualised and its history acknowledged.The LSWP was also behind the return in 2021 of a large bronze cockerel looted from Benin City in the 19th Century.As the chapel comes under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Ely, the college has had to petition a consistory court for permission to remove the plaque.The hearing is taking place in the chapel itself, with representatives and witnesses regularly gesturing towards and turning around in their seats to look at the memorial.The college wants to place it on permanent display elsewhere in the college alongside “contextualising” material.Alumni have also written in support of the college\u0027s application, including witness Amatey Doku - a former Cambridge Union president who was part of a group that led a five-year campaign to hand back Jesus College’s Okukor Bronze, one of the Benin Bronzes.Mr Mark Hill QC, representing the college, told the court that “This is nothing to do with erasing, cancelling or in some way nullifying the existence and the name of Tobias Rustat”.The Right Reverend Stephen Conway, the Bishop of Ely, told the hearing that the memorial needed to be removed so that current students were not reminded of the ways in which their forebears were tortured and dehumanised.Mr Gou and Mr Goldman, who is also representing the petitioners opposed, both questioned witnesses as to why the memorial could not be contextualised in situ.Sonita Alleyne, the master of Jesus College and the first black master of any Oxbridge college, told the hearing that adding context “wouldn’t take the memorial out of a position of veneration”.Mr Gau said Mr Rustat was a generous benefactor of the college and that, despite his very small involvement in the slave trade, there was now a black female master of the college.Ms Alleyne replied: How much sin do you need to have before you come off the wall?Defenders of Rustat have previously insisted that only a small fraction of his wealth ever came from slavery and that he was not directly or actively involved in it.Speaking in the hearing, Mr Gau said that students had made incorrect statements about Rustat’s involvement.Mr Gau referred to a phrase often repeated in students\u0027 emails: It\u0027s totally wrong for the statue of someone who was so heavily involved in the horrific crimes of slavery to be glorified in the heart of our community.And he said one email saying Mr Rustat made his money from slavery and caused immeasurable human suffering was incorrect.The Rev Crockford replied: It\u0027s my understanding that he did make some of his money from slavery.A student\u0027s email dated December 19 2020 said Mr Rustat amassed much of his wealth from the RAC, which Mr Gau said is simply not true.Another email from an undergraduate expressed strong support for the removal of the memorial, and claimed Mr Rustat has been clearly demonstrated as a very active slave trader.Mr Gau said there was no demonstration in any document that Tobias Rustat was any sort of slave trader.The Rev Crockford said: Not perhaps in the narrow definition of the word.The hearing will continue on Thursday.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict: Russia and China working to \u0026#39offset\u0026#39 Western sanctionsIslamic State leader killed in US raid in SyriaEnergy price cap rise: The Key points and how Rishi Sunak will help struggling householdsWatch: Italian navy officer who led cadets in viral TikTok routine cleared of bringing forces into disreputeChina \u0026#39subjected Indian teenager to electric shocks\u0026#39 after abducting him from disputed borderMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"plaid cymru demands end quirky names farm called hakuna matata","story":"Plaid Cymru has demanded an end to “quirky” non-traditional names after a farm named “Hakuna Matata” replaced the original Welsh title on an Ordnance Survey map.Sara Davies bought a plot of empty land, originally named Banc Cornicyll, near Gorslas, Carmarthenshire, in 1997.She built a house on the land and named the property with the Swahili phrase, which means “there are no troubles” and is used in the Disney film The Lion King.Now it has emerged that this change means the original name no longer appears anywhere on the Ordnance Survey map.Speaking to Wales Online, Mrs Davies said that the name, Banc Cornicyll, had disappeared before they had purchased the land in 1997, although it is listed on documents recording the sale still on the land registry.She added: We went to the Post Office, and said we were a new-build house.They said there was no registered address for the land so we could choose to call it whatever we liked.Obviously Lion King was popular at the time, some of my husband’s friends had been working in South Africa and knew that ‘hakuna matata’ wasn’t just a Disney term but genuine Swahili and therefore it had a meaning to it.”Despite Mrs Davies saying she would never have changed the name if she knew there was a historic alternative, Plaid Cymru warned that there was a growing “trend of anglicising names”.Plaid Cymru’s rural affairs and housing spokesperson, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said: “Wales has its own language and culture. This is no clearer imprint of this than in the unique place names of many homes, farms and places across the country.“As part of safeguarding the language, there must be an end to this trend of anglicising names, and the false belief that having quirky or anglicised names makes somewhere more palatable for others.“Our place names, be they houses or fields, tells a story, a story that is unique to this corner of the world. That rich heritage is a treasure that must be valued and protected.“There must be mechanisms in place, whether that’s through planning or legislation, to help protect the language, and to reflect the valuable history of locations in Wales.”Solicitor Simon Chandler, who helped create a scheme called Diogelwn, which aims to protect Welsh names, said a lot of people simply don’t understand the importance of place names.He added: “It is important because a house name or a place name is like a time capsule.“It tells us something about the history of the land and every time we lose one of those we lose a connection with the land and the past.“A lot of people who buy houses don\u0027t necessarily understand the significance of the name.”Mr Chandler’s scheme wants those who intend to sell property to include a clause in the contract which would block buyers from changing the name.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict: Russia and China working to \u0026#39offset\u0026#39 Western sanctionsIslamic State leader killed in US raid in SyriaEnergy price cap rise: The Key points and how Rishi Sunak will help struggling householdsWatch: Italian navy officer who led cadets in viral TikTok routine cleared of bringing forces into disreputeChina \u0026#39subjected Indian teenager to electric shocks\u0026#39 after abducting him from disputed borderMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"afghan christians have abandoned","story":"A strange and ancient verse in the book of Deuteronomy, 26.5, has long puzzled scholars. It says, “a wandering Aramean was my father” and is at the centre of vexed and energetic Rabbinic argumentation. One obvious meaning, however, is that the Hebrew people were themselves a migrant people – as the Bible clearly indicates. Migration is, of course, part of the human story to be found in the history of the British Isles as well as the Middle East, and everywhere where there are communities of people who suffer conflict, or natural disaster.But the displacement of millions of people in recent times is unprecedented, and the sheer numbers of those risking their lives to cross the Channel even on cold mid-winter days tell a story of desperation that is experienced all over the world. Many people fear that as the world fragments into conflict and climate change places pressure on resources, migration may spiral out of control.Today a new Fund is being launched in the name of the great 20th-century wartime leader, Bishop George Bell, specifically to support persecuted Christian pastors who are refugees. George Bell famously helped Lutheran pastors who opposed Hitler and had to flee for their lives. He, together with other British humanitarians such as Sir Nicholas Winton, recognised a need and acted upon it. There are still times today when Government inaction means that private iniduals have to act in the wake of a crying need.In response to the refugee crisis, former prime minister Gordon Brown said: “We’ve got to act for moral reasons but also it’s in our own self-interest to do so.” This reminded me of Archbishop William Temple’s dictum that the art of government is the art of so ordering life that self-interest prompts what justice demands. Both are right – allowing the situation to get worse is irresponsible.Another point to note is the fear in stable societies that we might be unsettled by the consequences of allowing large numbers from other cultural traditions to settle among us. I recognise the worry which, to some degree, we all share. Clearly those who join us must recognise that they need to embrace the values, traditions and history of the host nation, just as the hosts will allow the customs of the migrants to have a place among us.We are enriched by the presence of those who have joined us in recent decades. I hope the UK will give a firm moral lead as nations respond to the crisis facing the world today.To take one example, Afghanistan is now recognised by the Open Doors charity’s “watch list” as the worst place in the world to be a Christian. In spite of the pleas of organisations working with persecuted Christians, who face the death penalty for apostasy under the country’s strict interpretation of shariah law, the Government has not taken any steps at all to allow Christians to claim asylum in the UK. We have been awaiting a long-promised announcement from ministers on how they plan to include persecuted religious minorities in resettlement schemes.Barnabas Fund Freedom of Information requests to the UK Home Office found that in the Syrian resettlement scheme, Christians were consistently underrepresented in spite of the fact that they clearly faced violence and persecution. A tiny percentage – just 0.2 per cent – of the Syrian refugees accepted by the UK in 2017 were Christian. Underlying such shameful statistics was the Home Office’s apparent admission in its own equality assessment that the effect of its policy was to “disproportionately advantage” Muslims.Several hundred Afghan Christians, including pastors and converts, are currently in hiding in neighbouring countries. They are waiting to see whether they have a place on the UK Government’s resettlement scheme.The George Bell Memorial Fund will help them flee danger, despotism and violence, and travel to safety – whether they land on British shores or elsewhere. Sometimes it takes brave humanitarians like George Bell to stand up against even our own Government and bring the persecuted to safety.George Carey is a former Archbishop of Canterbury.

I’m not going to reject that thrill I had.”However, she went on: “Since then I’ve come to see a greater complexity to this, and in particular how the spotlight in these kinds of things is not just on Colston or any other unacceptable subject of statuary. I think the spotlight also comes down to us.“As I reflected back on my own thrill, I also realised I was sitting there with my smartphone, tweeting away and enjoying the moment, and had it crossed my mind that my smartphone was made in conditions - I don’t know if you want to call them modern slavery - but we know the exploitative conditions in which the things we rely on are made.“And I came to think that, in some ways, Colston and our feelings about him also had to work as a challenge to us.”Prof Beard said she wondered if our failure to consider what happens in foreign factories “is much the same as Colston’s sense, that we don’t really see things that are happening a very, very long way away”.She added: “Maybe we ought to look harder at ourselves… As well as deploring Colston, we might look at our own weak spots and we might wonder, I suppose, if our heroes will be toppled long after we’re dead, in a couple of hundred years’ time.“What are our faults, that will bring opprobrium onto us?”Last month, four people who admitted toppling the Colston statue walked free from court after a jury agreed that they had committed no crime.Prof Beard’s two-part series, which begins on Thursday on BBC Two, looks at art that has “challenged the political and social status quo”, including works banned by the Nazis and religious imagery.“These debates are not new. As long as there have been works of art, there have been works of art that people wanted to destroy or not see or pull down,” said Prof Beard.“We need to be a bit careful about thinking we invented the statue wars.”More from NewsIslamic State leader killed in US raid in SyriaRussia-Ukraine conflict: Russia and China working to \u0026#39offset\u0026#39 Western sanctionsEnergy price cap rise: The key points and how Rishi Sunak will help struggling householdsWatch: Italian navy officer who led cadets in viral TikTok routine cleared of bringing forces into disreputeChina \u0026#39subjected Indian teenager to electric shocks\u0026#39 after abducting him from disputed borderMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen would not abdicate voluntarily say royal experts","story":"To mark the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, The  hosted a panel of leading Royal experts on Wednesday night to discuss the moments that define her 70-year reign. Hosted by Camilla Tominey, Associate Editor at The , the discussion touched on the fallout from “Megxit”, the ongoing sex abuse case against Prince Andrew, and the future of the Royal Family.Royal biographer Penny Junor said the Queen has “always put the monarchy ahead of everything else”.Historian and professor Suzannah Lipscomb agreed and described Her Majesty’s attitude as “duty first and self second”.Discussing the response to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepping down as senior members of the family and the US court case against the Duke of York, Professor Lipscomb said the Queen has shown “integrity”.“I think it does show her protection in the end of the institution, of the family.”The panelists agreed that the Queen would not abdicate “voluntarily”, but said that Prince Charles is an “extraordinary man” who inspires genuine affection from a “huge number of people”.On the future of the monarchy, Prof Lipscomb said she believed it will be “slimmed down” to focus on the line of succession but that questions have arised about how different a man on the throne will be in contrast to the Queen’s “maternal presence”.Sustaining that relationship between the UK and the Commonwealth would really be a way of sustaining her legacy,” Prof Lipscomb added.“That\u0027s been really her greatest achievement, and she cares about it so very much.”Ms Junor said: “For the monarchy to survive, it has to be seen to be useful and fulfilling a purpose and not costing the earth and just to be worthwhile and for people to be able to relate to it.”The Queen, throughout all the cultural and political change that has occurred throughout her 70-year reign, has been an “absolute constant anchor in the midst of these seas”, Prof Lipscomb said.She said that the monarch will be remembered for her constancy, the Commonwealth, the longevity of her reign and her emphasis on reconciliation and unity.Ms Junor added: “I think she will be remembered as the mother of the nation.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict: Russia and China working to \u0026#39offset\u0026#39 Western sanctionsIslamic State leader killed in US raid in SyriaEnergy price cap rise: The Key points and how Rishi Sunak will help struggling householdsWatch: Italian navy officer who led cadets in viral TikTok routine cleared of bringing forces into disreputeChina \u0026#39subjected Indian teenager to electric shocks\u0026#39 after abducting him from disputed borderMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"raf scramble typhoon second day response aircraft approaching","story":"The Royal Air Force has launched Typhoon jets after undisclosed aircraft approached what an RAF spokesman described as the UK\u0027s area of interest, a day after jets responded to four Russian strategic bombers nearing Britain.It is understood that the jets flying in the UK area of interest are Russian.

Michael Gove alluded to this example of self-publicising 14th-century paternalism in his announcement yesterday of the Government’s “levelling up” proposals. The idea is that by bringing together innovators in one place, the Medicis unwittingly instigated the Renaissance.Mr Gove believes that by applying a similar model in England, left-behind parts of the country can be brought up to up to the standards of living seen in more prosperous regions. Boris Johnson, will also hope that investment directed towards these areas will be similarly badged to leave no doubt in the so-called Red Wall constituencies as to its provenance. Levelling up is the Prime Minister’s Big Idea for the parliament, but showing voters the benefits before the next election scheduled for 2024 will be a difficult task.Attracting entrepreneurs, businesses, arts venues, good schools, effective transport and the rest to areas that have hitherto struggled is clearly to be commended. The issue is how to do it. Top-down dispensation of taxpayers’ largesse to regions that for decades have relied disproportionately on the public sector for jobs is not the answer, although yet more public money was Labour’s demand, as it always is.The plan comprises a dozen pledges enshrined in statute to be achieved by 2030, with targets to reach certain benchmarks for improving outcomes. The political architecture to bring this about will involve greater devolution and the appointment of regional mayors with the powers to drive the agenda. As a former mayor, Mr Johnson clearly sees merit in this approach provided the right person is in charge. A mayor can act as a barrier to investment and development by pursuing anti-business policies. In London, and soon in Manchester and Bradford, “green” motoring charges are more likely to drive commerce away, not encourage it.The analysis of the UK as top-heavy is correct: London and the South East have a greater dominance in this country than almost anywhere else. But this is a function of the decline of manufacturing and the rise of services, not of state interventionism. If there is to be a renaissance in the regions they need competitive tax policies, freeports, deregulation and less, not more, government.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict: Russia and China working to \u0026#39offset\u0026#39 Western sanctionsIslamic State leader killed in US raid in SyriaEnergy price cap rise: The Key points and how Rishi Sunak will help struggling householdsWatch: Italian navy officer who led cadets in viral TikTok routine cleared of bringing forces into disreputeChina \u0026#39subjected Indian teenager to electric shocks\u0026#39 after abducting him from disputed borderMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"7 false misleading claims boris","story":"  or misleading claims Boris Johnson made today in fiery PMQs clashAt one point the Prime Minister repeated a  claim about jobs just hours after a data watchdog begged him not to.

The CPS said he had no involvement in the decision. Meanwhile, he claimed it was wrong for the PM to insist the Tories are the party of low taxes at a time when heaposs squeezing working people to the pips. Things were so tense, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle had to warn MPs not to accuse the PM of lying, which is unparliamentary.In his replies to Sir Keir, Boris Johnson earned roars of support from his own MPs as he trumpeted employment, GDP and wage figures.But perhaps he got a little carried away in his wording. Here are seven things he said that are either outright , or don’t stack up in context.  There are ‘more people in work than before the pandemic began’ This claim had been branded incorrect by the Office for Statistics Regulation just a day earlier in a letter to No. Director Ed Humpherson said the PM was referring to people on payrolls, but this excludes many self-employed. Mr Humpherson told Downing Street: The number of people on employer payrolls does not include everyone in work. ONS publishes data on the number of people in employment. The data for January – March  estimate that .m people were in employment compared with .m people in employment for September – November . It is therefore incorrect to state that there were more people in work at the end of this period than the start.  Tories are ‘lting the Living Wage - which this party introduced’ Tory Chancellor George Osborne introduced the National Living Wage in , but this was a rebranded version of the National Minimum Wage for over-s. That means the National Living Wage is, legally speaking, the same thing as the National Minimum Wage - which Labour introduced in . Importantly, the NLW is lower than the ‘real’ Living Wage which has been promoted for years by campaigners as the amount that meets everyday needs. The real Living Wage is currently £. or £. in London - compared to £. for the government’s National Living Wage, which will rise to £. in April. ‘In spite of all the dficulties we’ve faced, we have now got the fastest growth in the G. Absolutely true’ Technically yes, the UK’s GDP is forecast to grow by .% in  - the highest of any G country. But that is not the full picture - it also fell by .% in  according to the IMF, the worst of any G country. That means it’s now bouncing back faster too. According to the House of Commons Library, UK GDP was still down by .% in July-September  compared to pre-pandemic levels. This was the second-worst of any G country, behind Canada, Italy, Germany, the Eurozone, France and the US. The Commons Library also warned these figures are not % comparable across countries due to dferences in how output in the education and health sectors is calculated. ‘We’re getting , people off welfare and into work through our Way to Work plan’Tory ministers have set a ‘Way to Work’ target to help , Universal Credit claimants into work by June.But despite the PM’s boast, it’s thought the plan is only to get , people into jobs - not off Universal Credit. Sources told the Mirror some of those people are likely to continue claiming, at least in the short term, as around two-fths of UC claimants already have a job. They remain eligible for benefits because their wages are too low. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote a letter in April  ‘suggesting we could secure PPE supplies from a theatrical costumier and we could get ventilators from a professional football agentapos Ms Reeves did write a letter, and the firms it mentioned did include one behind ‘historic re-enactment clothing’ that was offering to make - gowns a week. However, the context is that she passed on the details of  firms that were offering to supply PPE - without actually endorsing their work.Instead her letter told Michael Gove : “You and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have.“But as they have not received a reply after contacting the Government, I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them.” Labour insist she was simply raising concerns about the number of firms at the time that were not getting a response.  Keir Starmer ‘would have kept us in lockdown’While he didn’t specy this time, Boris Johnson has repeatedly made this claim in relation to December  when Omicron surged.The Labour leader welcomed additional measures to curb Omicron rates before Christmas  - but he had never called for a lockdown. At one point Mr Starmer said: Weaposve got a government that are hinting at further restrictions but theyaposre more concerned and tied up with party management at the moment than it is with public health. The question on my lips and I think on the publicaposs lips is where is the prime minister One time Keir Starmer definitely did demand a lockdown was in autumn  - and Boris Johnson eventually caved and obeyed those calls a few weeks later. ‘We’ve opened Freeports across the country just in the last few days’Eight successful bidders for Freeports were announced at the March  Budget.Since then they have been working up their plans. Teesside opened in November and Thames in mid-December. But when we asked the government today, we were told the other six are yet to open. Neither the Mirror nor officials we asked could find evidence of new Freeports opening in the last month or so.

Here, we take a look at some of the governments promises - and what they really meanMichael Gove in Westminster today Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByJason BeattieHead of politicsRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsThe governmentaposs levelling up plans have been slammed as devoid of new ideas. Ministers said the missions include “improving wellbeing in every area” of the UK, a devolution deal for every part of England that wants one, and bringing public transport connectivity across the country “signicantly closer to the standards of London”.Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove also raised the prospect of the House of Lords moving out of London. “I think it’d be a really good thingthe House of Lords were to meet for at least part of the time in Glasgow or in York,” he told Times Radio. But Labour said all of the pledges so far have been recycled pots of money and not what we were promised.Here, we look at some of the things announced by the government, and give our verdict on what they really mean.  Schools They say: “By , the number of primary schoolchildren achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and maths will have increased.”Our verdict: The government has set a new goal of ensuring that % of schoolchildren will have reached the national standard, but in , the figure was %.Ministers have identied  communities for intensive additional support and they are largely outside of London. Quite how “intensive” this support will be delivered is also not clear.  Housing What they are promising: Improve the quality of rented homes and bring in the National Landlord Register to aid tenants. The green belt will be protected and first-time buyers will increase.Verdict: Alicia Kennedy of the Generation Rent campaign group welcomed the National Landlord Register and pledge to end no-fault evictions.But there is no extra money to build more affordable housing. No is stoking the property market by helping people get a foot on the ladder rather than investing in social housing. Mayors What they say: “By , every part of England that wants one will have a devolution deal with powers at or approaching the highest level of devolution and a simplied, long-term funding settlement.”Our verdict: Critics have hit out at the Tories’ piecemeal approach to devolving power so far, with cities having more controls than neighbouring areas, as well as the benefit of mayors such as Andy Burnham acting as national champions. The fear now is that doing deals with each area in turn could achieve the opposite of an “end to the postcode lottery”. Health and wellbeing What they say: By , the gap in Healthy Le Expectancy between local areas where it is highest and lowest will have narrowed, and by  HLE will rise by five years.Our verdict: The latest ONS data showed that the UK overall had seen the first fall in le expectancy in  years. Researchers recently found a -year gap between the le expectancy of a man living in Kensington and Cha and Blackpool. The Health Foundation says the Government “faces a massive challenge”, with funds needed to tackle smoking, obesity and NHS improvement.Crime What they are promising: By  homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime will have fallen, focused on the worst-affected areas.There will be , more police officers on our streets by  and a £million Safer Streets Fund to improve the environment and cut offending in high-crime areas. Verdict: There is a question mark over whether these targets can be hit. Under the Tories police officers fell from , to ,.Despite a vow to recruit , more, there are now ,. In the year to March  there was a % rise in homicides and % rise in kne crime. Latest figures show fewer than one in  crimes are solved. Transport What they say: “By , local public transport connectivity across the country will be signicantly closer to the standards of London, with improved services, simpler fares and integrated ticketing.”Our verdict: Towns and cities outside of the capital require dferent transport solutions to the economic powerhouse that is the UK’s capital, with buses and creaking rail lines badly in need of investment.The Government says the plan will take in £.billion for city regions UK-wide and £bn for the integrated rail plan. But already, promises of £bn for bus services appear to be roughly half of the cash promised, with ministers to focus on “bus improvements in areas where this can make the most impact”. The £bn integrated rail plan, meanwhile, has been watered down with the key £bn plan for Leeds to Manchester to be delivered through upgrades on the existing transpennine track, rather than a new line through Bradford.  Sports and culture What they are promising: A £bn Culture Recovery Fund for museums, theatres, cinemas and heritage groups. More Arts Council cash to go outside London. Extra support for grassroots sports.Verdict: All of these measures have been previously announced. The Culture Recovery Fund was part of the pandemic package to help venues during lockdown.While more money from the Arts Council will go to regions, its budget has not been increased. The £m for new football pitches was unveiled last June. Broadband What they are promising: By , the UK will have nationwide gigabit-capable broadband and G coverage, with G coverage for most of the population.Verdict: Not only a re-announcement – it’s actually a delay. Ministers already said they were investing £billion in G coverage, aiming to have it across most of the UK by . Now it’s . MPs on the Public Accounts Committee warn the goal of full coverage does not include more than , remote homes.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHouse of LordsHealth Trust Inc.Andy BurnhamMichael GoveEnergy billsFirst-time buyersLe expectancyPublic transportCrimePoliticsLevelling Up WatchDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes after the price of wholesale gas quadrupled over the last year, worsened by the threat of a Russian war in Ukraine. At the same time the Bank of England has raised interest rates to .% from .%, making mortgages more expensive.Chancellor Rishi Sunak today announced a three-pronged fightback with a £ Warm Home Discount, £ off bills and £ off council tax. He said: “Without government action this would be incredibly tough for millions of hard-working families. So the government is going to step in to directly help people manage those extra costs.”  But furious critics said it’s not enough. Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, declared: “We now have the Klarna Chancellor - get it now and pay later.” So what has been announced today and are you eligible  Here is the move explained.What is the rise in the energy price cap in April The average household’s energy bills will rise by £ a year from April , regulator Ofgem has confirmed. Those on default tarfs paying by direct debit will see an increase from £, to £, - or %. Prepayment customers, many on benefits, will be worse hit with an increase of £ from £, to £,. The move will affect  million households and follows a £-a-year rise only in October. It will affect default tarf customers who haven’t switched to a fixed deal and those who remain with their new supplier after their previous supplier exited the market. Those on fixed deals will continue to pay what they do now, but will see their rates soar by the time they move to a new fixed deal. What has Rishi Sunak announced today The Tory Chancellor announced a three-pronged approach to make up for about half of the energy bills hit coming in April. More or less all British households will get £ off their energy bills in October in a £.bn scheme, but then have to pay back this discount over five years. Around % of households in England on the lowest council tax bands will get a £ rebate in April, which won’t have to be paid back. And finally, a £-a-year Warm Home Discount will be extended to more people in England and Wales and raised by £ a year from October.Who is eligible for the £ off energy bills and how do I get it All domestic electricity customers - around million households - will receive a £ upfront discount on their bills. Energy suppliers will be loaned the money to do this by the government, and apply the discount “from October”, said the Treasury. Indications are that you won’t have to do anything to claim the discount and it will be applied to your bills automatically. But about % of pre-payment customers - who top up at the shop - will get something “more manual”, such as barcodes or QR codes through the post. Customers will then have to pay back the £ discount at a rate of £ per year out of their bills, in the five years from  to . Rishi Sunak said the £ discount will apply in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland will have the funds to choose to do the same thing. The full details of how it’ll be paid - and paid back - have not yet been worked out and the Business Department will run a consultation. Who is eligible for the £ off council tax and how do I get it All households in England that are in council tax bands A, B, C or D will get a £ rebate off their council tax bills for one year. The government says this covers around % of all the households in the country. The rebate will be made directly by councils in April, when they issue bills for the next year, as a one-off credit on your direct debit account. Some households do not pay by direct debit. The Treasury claimed councils “will be ready to process their claims in April”. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it will not apply to second homes or empty homes. We are still waiting for more details. Unlike the £ discount on energy bills, the £ off council tax will not have to be paid back. This policy will only apply in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive funding to replicate the movethey wish to.You can check your council tax band here.Do I have to pay it back The £ discount off energy bills in October does have to be paid back, at a rate of £ per year for five years from . The £ rebate off council tax bills does not have to be paid back - but there is a sting in the tail. Council tax bills will still rise this year, at % for many authorities, and is likely to rise again in April . That meansthere’s no rebate next year, people will feel a big rise in their pockets all at once.What other help was announced today The Warm Home Discount Scheme will be raised by £ to £ in October, and eligibility will be extended to about , more households than now. That will expand the scheme to .million households in total on a permanent basis - but only from next winter. Currently you’re eligibleyou’re on a low income and meet a criteria from your supplier, or you get a Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit. Under the expansion, more people will be assigned as being eligible for the discount by their supplier, which is done using a complicated formula. The Warm Home Discount Scheme applies to England and Wales. Meanwhile, there is help for some people who will slip through the cracks of the council tax discount announced today. The Treasury said there’ll be £m of discretionary funds for people who are vulnerable or on low incomes, that either do not pay Council Tax, or pay Council Tax for properties in Bands E-H. Does it go far enough  Furious critics, unions and Labour say it does not.It only funds half the rise in energy bills, £ of the £ has to be paid back, and it ignores all the other rises heading down the track in April. National Insurance is rising, inflation is sending prices in shops soaring, and student loan repayment thresholds and tax thresholds are being frozen. Labour MP Chris Bryant branded it “puny” saying: “£ isn’t going to touch the sides for my constituents in the Rhondda. “Gas and electricity up for the average family in my constituency by £. Fuel up by £. The average weekly shop up by £.“ Universal Credit cut by £,. National Insurance up by £. And frozen tax allowances by him will cost another £. That’s £, in a constituency where the average wage is £,. That is really going to cause hardship. £ doesn’t even touch it.” What were the other suggestions Rishi Sunak rejected Labour had called for the % VAT rate to be cut on energy bills, but Rishi Sunak said this would “disproportionately benefit wealthier households”. “There would be no guarantee suppliers would pass on the discount to customers,” he said, “and this would become a permanent government subsidy on people’s bills.” Others, including the Resolution Foundation and Labour MP Stephen Timms, raised the idea of raising benefits to target the poorest instead of the chosen plan.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves slammed the use of council tax - as some rich people live in Band D homes while poorer bigger families can live in Band E, partly because bandings are outdated.She said: “That will mean many of the poorest households will not get extra support while some of the richest do. And it’s people living in the north and the Midlands who’ll lose out most. “The hypocrisy, the day after the government’s Levelling Up White Paper, is obvious.” Rishi Sunak defended his decision not to only announce temporary help for families - much of which will have to be paid back out of future bills. He said: “It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy articially low. “For me to stand here and pretend we don’t have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest. “But what we can do is take the sting out of a signicant price shock for millions of families by making sure the increase in prices is smaller initially, and spread over a longer period.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TaxCouncil taxEnergy billsInterest ratesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Treasury insiders denied that Mr Johnson had set a precedent that other ministers should follow.  They said Mr Sunak had felt it was important to be visible and supportive of the Government on the day Sue Gray published an update of her report. The Chancellor later attended a crowded meeting of the Toriesapos backbench  committee in a show of solidarity with his beleaguered boss. And he led Treasury questions in the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday.  Mr Sunak, who was one of the only ministers wearing a facemask on the frontbench, tested negative before the Commons statement.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, sitting on Ms Patelaposs other side, later tested positive for Covid and was forced to miss her trip to the Ukraine with the PM. The legal requirement to stay at homeyou have a positive case in your household is no longer in place.But official NHS guidance still “strongly advises” people to limit close contact with others in crowded spaces and work from homepossible.It states that they should limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces. The advice adds that people should work from homeyou are able to and wear a face-covering in crowded places. A spokesman for Mr Sunak said: The Chancellor has followed the legal requirements to the letter. “He has taken daily lateral flow tests and has limited his social contact where possible, whilst also ensuring that he is able to continue to conduct important Government and Parliamentary business as the public would expect.  Just last month, No  announced Mr Johnson was unlikely to be seen in public for a week after a member of his immediate family, later revealed to be baby Romy, tested positive for Covid. The PMaposs official spokesman said he would heed official guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact, he told reporters. He’ll be working from No , doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No  and indeed inside No  as well, having limited contact with others in the building, and conducting meetings online.” However, Mr Johnson faced accusations he was hiding behind the illness, as it came while he faced intense scrutiny over his attendance at a BYOB garden party in No  during lockdown. The PM cancelled a visit to a vaccination centre in Lancashire, where he would have faced tough media questions, while a Downing Street press conference was also axed.

While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared. I get it, and I will fix it! He says he is taking personal charge, and setting up the Office of the Prime Minister. So who was in charge of his office for the past three years  Where is the drunken boozehound who careered around Downing Street Friday night drinkathons, encouraging staffers to let off steam with a long chug on the vodka bottle  Who allowed the culture of recklessness and lawlessness, at the heart of a government that was criminalising the same sins in others  Which leader has led his party to a disgrace worse than Windrush or Grenfell or Orgreave Bring me his head! bellows Boris from the Despatch Box. I will slay this beast, the same way that I would have slain Jimmy Savile,only I didnapost think that investigating historical sex abuse was money spaffed up the wall!Other things he has taken personal control of include Brexit, social care, test and trace, the energy crisis, the ministerial code of conduct, the saving of Owen Paterson, and funding for his gold wallpaper. The fact he took personal control of the vaccines may have something to do with the fact that  million people donapost want them. How many times has he taken charge, only for things to spin out of control  How many times has he shaken up the civil service, only to be rattled himself  Read more The nation is now watching the Conservative Party the same way as the rest of the street watches a victim get out of the police car, andto their abuser. They drag with them a whole country into this deranged, gnarled, unhappy misgovernment, back to the man who wonapost promise to publish the full truth in the House of Commons, where he might be held in contempthe failed to, but will promise it in the bar, to the MPs he has lied to for years, and who have been brainwashed into thinking such a promise is a concession rather than a repetition.Meanwhile the PM only appears in public when the public can be kept away from him. Abba tribute bands are raising their prices for satin satire. Andyou want a three-word slogan to describe where we are, it is simply: another fine mess. The PM or his we may get a fixed penalty notice pictures may or may not emerge. He may be out on his ear, or he may convince enough MPs to give him one more go. Itaposs irrelevant, because the fallout of this radioactive scandal will last to the ballot box and beyond it reaches into homes and hearts, to the guts and spines of millions to whom the words aposToryapos and aposPartyapos are now as repugnant as the fact that people like Leshie had their pain doubled and then dismissed by a man whose charm has long since been spent. The Tories got drunk on power, picked a man who can be fooled by a cake, and then dithered about whether to let him keep hurting the rest of us. They cannot see what the rest of us can: their party is over.

The only way to solve the problem was to dig up the ground floor of the Hampshire house and remove hundreds of metres of bamboo rhizomes. The home insurance claim for the damage was apparently more than £,, reports the Express.Japanese Knotweed is famously a nightmare, but experts have said bamboo can be just as baditaposs left to grow unmonitored. The roots of bamboo can travel up to a whopping  metres and they can break through all sorts of surfaces, from bricks and drains to cavity walls and patios.  aposRunningapos ieties of bamboo like the one found at the Hampshire property are particularly prolic as they send lateral shoots out underneath the ground which can sometimes pop up on neighboursapos plots. Founder and MD of Environet UK, Nic Seal, told the Sun: Through no fault of their own, the homeowners have suffered signicant financial cost, stress and inconvenience, being required to vacate their home for several months. The truth is, most bamboos are invasiveplanted directly into the ground and left to their own devices. He added that the Hampshire case was the worst case of bamboo encroachment heaposd ever seen in this country. Experts advise itaposs best to choose a clumping iety of bamboo rather than a running iety to avoid spreading problems like these. Those buying bamboo should also plant it in a pot instead of in the ground and make sure to trim it frequently.

This will not be tolerated.Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcallingImage: Getty Images AlloyopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Feb |commentsIt probably seems like a small thing, at best. At worst, a waste of time and resources. It’s not though. It’s important. A tiny triumph. A baby step in the right direction. Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcalling – “targeting people who are shouting things from their vehicles at women girls. This will not be tolerated.” Last week they stopped a van after the occupant yelled at some women who turned out to be plain-clothed police officers. Oh to have seen his face. He was reported for a breach of the Public Spaces Protection Order and is likely to be issued with a £ fine or taken to court, which is another way of saying that he was left in no doubt that THIS IS NOT OK. That’s apparently what men need to be told, reminded of, in no uncertain terms, so they’re one hundred per cent clear. No, it’s not just a bit of harmless fun that we need to lighten up about. It’s horrendous. Scary. Humiliating.  Maybe this concept is confusing because we’re living in an age of sharing, honesty, and talking about everything. Mostly that’s great, but somewhere within this, a simple truth has got lost. Sometimes, it’s good NOT to talk. Sometimes, you need to shut the hell up. Perhaps we need a massive advertising campaign, public service announcement telly commercials and posters everywhere to clearly inform everyone once and for all: Stop telling women what you think of their bodies. Especially when they haven’t asked, which is pretty much always. There are no Thought Police – anyone is free to think whatever they like. The opinions inside someone’s head can’t hurt anyone . The problem comes when they’re broadcast out loud to the woman you’re thinking them about, be it on the street, online, or on a radio show, like that fool who talked about Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay. What you think of the woman’s body is irrelevant, by the way. Evenyou believe it’s a compliment, still keep it to yourself. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but most women do not feel flattered and delighted when a stranger gives them positive feedback about a body part. We feel embarrassed, and frightened. And we’re taught to ignore this behaviour – apart from in Bradford, it’s up to us to deal with it ourselves – to put our heads down, walk quicker, in case the situation escalates.We’re luckywe are only verbally harassed. Even online, where the threat of physical violence is removed, these kind of comments are dangerous, and unacceptable. They perpetuate the belief that women’s appearances are fair game for discussion and debate. That our bodies are anyone’s business but our own. They also ensure that the practice of speaking about women in this way seeps down to future generations, continuing the cycle. It has to stop. As the fight to make our streets safer for women goes on, catcalling being taken seriously in one city in the UK is just a drop in the ocean. But at least it’s a start. Maybe those TV ads aren’t a bad idea – and it’s obvious what music they should be set to. Ronan Keating, You Say It Best, When You Say Nothing At All.

James Bradshaw, , says the builder, who heaposd hired to add a two-storey extension to their house, would only work five-hour days and when confronted about his shoddy workmanship brazenly quit saying he didnapost want the stress .The couple agreed to pay almost £, to the builder, who came recommended by a family friend, for an extension to accommodate their growing family, a job that was supposed to be completed by August . But after months of issues and delays the builder vanished in September, leaving James and his family £, out of pocket and living on a building site. The -year-old says he has since had a surveyor assess the work that had been done, who concluded that it needed to be completely demolished and restarted due to structural issues. When James contacted a solicitor he was advised not to bother taking the builder to court as he wonapost see a penny of his hard-earned savings again - evenhe wins the case.  The sales director has now shared photos of the mess heaposs been left with in a bid to warn other conscientious and decent peopleapos not to fall victim to cowboy builders. James, from Wolverhampton, said: The reason we were having the extension done is because weaposve had a daughter and we have three children living with us already - my son and my fianceaposs two children. We were having the extension done to create two extra bedrooms and to extend the kitchen and dining room to have a bit more space for the kids. It was shocking from day one. He never did a full week, heaposd only turn up two to three times a weekat all and heaposd turn up at :am and leave at pm. Every time the building inspector came to review the work heaposd done it kept getting failed so he had to redo lots of it. Eventually I said to him aposyou need to come in for a meeting because this just isnapost good enoughapos. As he walked through the door he said aposIaposm going to give you your money back and you can get someone  to complete it because I canapost get it done and I donapost want the stress anymoreapos. He only offered us £, back and I just said aposyouaposre a joke and youaposll be hearing from our solicitoraposs. He left our house in the state itaposs in and we havenapost spoken to him since. Itaposs been a nightmare. Itaposs put a lot of strain on mine and my partneraposs le and caused a lot of devastation for our family. Weaposd been saving the money for about  years and weaposd got a loan to help as well which weaposre still paying back at the minute.  The two-storey extension was supposed to create two extra bedrooms and an extended kitchen and dining area within  weeks, for an agreed cost of £,. By the time of their final meeting in September - two months after the extension was supposed to be finished - there was only an incomplete single-storey and a plank of wood blocking where the back door used to be. The following month, an independent building survey confirmed that what was built was plagued with structural issues and needed to be completely demolished and restarted, despite the parents already forking out a whopping £,. The report found that the walls were out of square in numerous places and either had a cavity that was too wide or cavity ties that were too short. This means they werenapost fully tied in and didnapost provide full stability. It also noted that the entire structure was at risk of damp due to multiple issues, including mortar breaching the wall cavities, and aposlazy workmanshipapos was evident in the internal brickwork, where a broken brick aposlooked to have been jammed in placeapos. Overall the report concluded: Considering the overall condition of the build we would recommend that it is removed down to foundation level and the structure started again. Demolishing the work alone would cost an additional £. In light of this, James sought legal advice to try and claw back some of his hard-earned savings back to be able to recty the nightmare build.  But the dad says that his solicitor then delivered the devastating news that although he would definitely win in court he would never see a penny of the £, again because the builder could simply close the business down due to not having the funds to repay it. James said: I had a meeting with the solicitor and said aposdonapost tell me what I want to hear, tell me the honest truthapos. Her words were aposthe only person that wins in this is the solicitors because we get paid either way, itaposs going to cost you £, to £, to go to courtapos. She said aposyou will win in court but his solicitor will advise him to shut the company down because he hasnapost got the money to pay it back so you wonapost see a pennyapos.Two days after we received the court letter it came up on Facebook that the company was closed so I think heaposs already shut it down. Weaposve looked into his history a bit now as well and heaposs well known for opening companies and shutting them down - I think this is the fourth company heaposs done that with since . The family had new builders start at their home last week to demolish the unstable structure and restart the extension. But at a new estimated cost of £,, they can no longer afford to get much of the project done. The heartbroken dad hopes that by warning people about the dishonest and unreliable cowboy he fell victim to, he can help other families avoid the same fate. James said: Thereaposs nothing we can do now, we just have to bite the bullet that weaposre not going to get anything from it because the system doesnapost support this kind of thing. Weaposve got new builders in now but because weaposve wasted so much money we can only afford to get the shell done and weaposll have to do the inside stage by stage. The new quote to put right and finish it is £, because thereaposs been a huge increase in prices of building materials and labour as well as the extra work of demolishing it.

There are currently , new daily symptomatic coronavirus cases in the UK on average, based on test data from up to three days ago, which is an increase of  per cent from , reported last week. Of those, those who were vaccinated with at least two doses made up , of the new daily symptomatic cases in the UK, up from , new daily cases last week.The study also shows that in England  in  have covid, with  in  in Wales and  in  in Scotland.  It also reveals that cases are now rising in all age groups, but the rise is much smaller in the + age groups, particularly in the older, more vulnerable + group, the increase is very small. According to the data, ZOE estimates that  per cent of people experiencing new “cold-like“ symptoms are likely to have symptomatic Covid.Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE COVID Study app, said: “While the bad news is we are again approaching , new cases a day, it’s encouraging that recorded hospitalisations, ICU cases and deaths are still coming down as Omicron is less severe in a vaccinated population.With a lag of several weeks between infections and hospitalisations, we’ll continue to monitor this rate closely in the coming weeks. We saw a similar rebound and second peak during the Delta wave as people relaxed more and children went back to school. It seems many are, again, preempting the end of the Covid- pandemic.It’s much too early for this.High case rates will likely be with us until late spring before the warmer weather and the summer holidays help reduce infections again.He addd: Over the past few weeks, the UK governmentaposs confirmed cases data has begun to move further away from ZOE’s findings. There are a number of reasons for this. The biggest factor is the change in testing behaviour that has happened this year. ZOE Contributors are now logging more positive LFTs in the app, and fewer PCRs. LFTs no longer have to be confirmed by a PCR so are often not being logged with the government, so confirmed case data is missing thousands of LFT results, leading to massive under-reporting. This subtle but important change in behaviour, highlights the importance of having multiple methods to track COVID in the population and shows the power of the citizen scientists that log with ZOE every day. The way ZOE collects and analyses the data means our data is always ahead of the other national surveys that are just beginning to show rises.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AppsEducationCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Prosecutor Sara Anthony told Cheltenham Magistrates Court that a year ago Awdry was disqualied for le from owning, keeping, transporting or being in any way involved with dogs. The ban was imposed in February  at Gloucester Crown Court after Awdry and two other defendants were convicted for selling puppies without a licence, and failing to meet the needs of the animals. The puppies were kept in squalid conditions at Awdryaposs home and were poorly looked after. Awdry and his two accomplices were estimated to have made £, from puppy farming over four years. Yesterday, Ms Anthony told the court that the Forest of Dean District Council was tipped off that Awdry was still using dogs for work and had been seen transporting his dogs about, shortly after his dog ban was imposed. On April ,  at .am two members of the councilaposs street warden team were in the Bream area and were travelling along Oakwood Road when they spotted Awdry in a white Nissan vehicle beside a five bar gate,” Ms Anthony said. “They both had a clear view of a black and white Collie sitting on the front passenger seat. They watched Awdry turn the vehicle around and drive to the other side of the field and park alongside an outbuilding. They both saw Awdry unload two Collie dogs from the vehicle and usher them towards the outbuilding. Awdry was then observed ing to his vehicle without the dogs. Awdry drove down Highfield Close and disappeared from the area. The street wardens checked the outbuilding and observed that the two dogs were inside. While the wardens were making notes of what they had just witnessed Awdry ed in his van accompanied by his we. He parked beside the outbuilding and opened the door while Mrs Awdry encouraged the dogs into the vehicle from the passenger side. Awdry ed to the vehicle and drove off. On the second occasion the district council was contacted by PC Katherine McDay who was driving in a marked vehicle from Coleford to Bream on May  last year at around pm when she noticed Awdryaposs Nissan van on the B near the area of Bream Cross. She noticed a large amount of sheep coming from a field opposite. Pc McDay travelled past the Nissan and turned around. While she travelled back towards the van she noticed that Awdry was driving and his we was in the passenger seat with a black Collie dog on her lap. As Pc McDay passed she noticed that the dog was released out of the passenger door and it began herding sheep along the road. A short while later she noticed Awdry drive away from the area and saw that the sheep were no longer visible. The dog had its head out of the passenger window. Clive Rees, defending, said: I feel that Awdry did not fully understand the rules surrounding the disqualication order. He was under the impression thathe had somebody with him who was responsible for the dogs he would be complying with the terms of the order. Awdry had already transferred ownership of the dogs to his we. He has kept dogs all his le and, being a commoner, he has the right to roam sheep on the common. He frequently gets calls from police to remove them from the road, eventhey are not his own sheep. When the order was initially issued Awdry would get his we to drive his van with the dogs. However over the past few months Mrs Awdryaposs health has deteriorated and she has recently lost much of her eyesight and most of her hearing. Mr Awdry has become her carer. Awdry started the order with good intentions. His son has now taken over the responsibility for the dogs. Whoever saw the dogs, there was no mention of them being concerned about the animalsapos welfare. In the future Awdry will have to come to terms about not looking after sheep in future. He realises now that he is in a serious position. He should have known the position when he was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court. Awdry pleaded guilty to breaching a disqualication order imposed after conviction on two occasions. On or around April ,  at Lydney, having been previously disqualied from keeping dogs he transported two black and white collie dogs inside a white Nissan white van, and on May ,  he transported a black and white collie dog inside the same van whilst directing  sheep to exit a field and move along the B Rd heading towards Bream. Presiding Justice Major Paul Adey sentenced Awdry to six weeks imprisonment for the two offences of transporting dogs and activated the  week suspended sentence consecutively. We note that the dogs are no longer in your and Mrs Awdryaposs ownership, a move which should have been undertaken  months ago, said the magistrate. “We also acknowledge that the dogs have not been mistreated whilst they have been in your care. The justices ordered that outstanding court costs of £, and the £, costs of yesterdayaposs case must be paid by Awdry by th April this year. After yesterdayaposs hearing Forest of Dean District Councilaposs Animal Welfare Member Champion, Councillor Nicky Packer said Our Street Warden team do a fantastic job year round of ensuring that animals in our district are looked after properly, and that those who mistreat or cause harm to their animals are held accountable.” This verdict should stand as testament to this. A ban on keeping dogs means exactly that. If, as in this case, it isnapost followed, our Street Warden and Counter Fraud and Enforcement team will enforce it. A council spokesperson added The prosecution was undertaken by Forest of Dean District Councilaposs Legal Services team working with the Councilaposs Street Wardens Team and Counter Fraud and Enforcement Unit .

A -year-old man, who was found at the scene by officers, remains in custody after being arrested on suspicion of arson. The man was also taken to hospital for treatment on Tuesday. Gazing upon the destruction on Wednesday, parents whose children currently attend the school and former pupils spoke of how the fire has devastated a whole community. Ex-pupil Valerija Balinskaite, , said she broke down after hearing the news.  I was in tears, she said. It was awful. I live just a five minutesapos walk from the school. I saw a video of the fire and it just broke me. I have so many happy memories from the school. Grace Berry, whose seven-year-old daughter attends the school, said: It is just devastating for the community. It is devastating for the kids and teachers to wake up to these circumstances. But it is a strong community and I am sure it will pull together and pull through - these things tend to bring people together. Derek Barlow said the school is widely considered as iconic in the local area, and many of the people living nearby graced its hallways when they were younger. My we went there and I have had two children who have been to this school, he said. It was a bit gut-wrenching watching it last night. My we was sending me photos of it . She was very upset about it and the community is very upset about it, actually. The community is absolutely devastated about it - this school is iconic.  Headteacher Mr Mungo Sheppard said that emergency services had managed to save quite a bit of the building. I have no idea how quickly we can get back in, he continued. We have completely lost four classrooms for our year , ,  and  children. The direct fire damage has spread no further than that, so we have been able to save quite a lot of our school. It is devastating for these children. They are in tears because they canapost come to school today and they do not know what they are going to come back to. Mr Sheppard added that some children may have to be educated at other sites while repair work takes place at the school. Leader of Calderdale Council, Cllr Tim Swt, said: It was heartbreaking to hear the news yesterday evening about the fire at Ash Green Community Primary School.  My thoughts are with all the staff, parents and of course the pupils who usually attend this school. We know how much disruption our schools have faced throughout the Covid pandemic, so itaposs particularly upsetting that Ash Green and the local community is now facing a further period of upheaval. The school is working hard to make sure children are well supported and plans are being put in place to minimise disruption for pupils as much as possible. We are working closely with the school to support this and to assist with the recovery process going forward. Ten fire engines and one aerial ladder  were used to subdue the flames.A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police said: Enquiries are continuing today into the fire at Ash Green Primary School in Mixenden.A -year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of arson is currently in custody.

This comes as a quarter of motorists said they were unsure of the rules around parking on pavements,Manchester Evening News reported .New laws around parking on pavements are one of many coming into power this year. And as well as facing fines, drivers caught breaking the new laws could be hit with points on their license too.  Some of these changes are still under consultation in England and Wales, but it is believed that local councils will have more power when it comes to fining reckless parkers. However, parking on pavements is already illegal in London and some other parts of the UK. Scotland’s rulings are expected to come into force in . Whilst some drivers may wrongly think parking on the pavement is fine, and barely an offence, the paths are there for the safety of pedestrians. If blocked, pedestrians might be forced to walk around in the road, which is jeopardises their safety.  Alex Kindred, car insurance expert at Confused, told the MEN: “What may seem a small inconvenience to some, might be a huge hindrance to others. “But it’s important to remember that pavements are there for the use and safety of pedestrians only, and therefore should be respected by all other road users. “However, without a clearer understanding of the law around pavement parking, it’ll be hard to implement fines to drivers who break the rules.

The issue can be particularly dangerous for children and those with disabilities. A number of changes were made in the Highway Code recently which aims to protect all road users from unnecessary danger.  One of the rules involved pavements and the potential danger cyclists and pedestrians face when travelling down them. Rule  of the Highway Code states: “When using an electric vehicle charge point, you should park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for pedestrians from trailing cables. “Display a warning signyou can. After using the charge point, you shouldcharging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to pedestrians and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Highways England\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fearless pilots once used the base, which was built in , to help defend some of the biggest cities in England during the war.Some of the site continued to be used decades after the fighting but much of it has been left to decay for years, reports Yorkshire Live.During WWII, the airfield was home to ious aircraft from Hurricanes, Mosquitoes, Blenheims and Beaufighters to Typhoons and Mustangs. It also housed a fast but flimsy wooden aircraft called the de Havilland Mosquito which was only in service for a matter of months before being disused.  The base was tasked with defending some of the great industrial cities of northern England from German bombers at the beginning of the war. Some of Britainaposs very first night fighters flew out of the Yorkshire base with some paying the ultimate price to protect the nation. The site also hosted a signicant amount of squadrons including the firstRAF aposEagleapos Squadron of American volunteers, the first all-Canadian RAF Squadron, and the first all-Polish RAF Squadron.  Photographer Bearded Reality captured a series of pictures which show what is left of the base some eight decades later. The images offer an insight into what le would have been like for those who spent time there over the years. In a YouTube video, he shows some of the rooms that were covered in graffiti and taken over by nature including an old bar and kitchen area.  Debris hung from the ceilings while some of the flooring has collapsed. After the war ended, RAF Church Fenton was used as a frontline fighter station in the defence of northern England to the late s. Since then it has been falling apart and simply left to the elements. Initially, the station continued to be used after the war and its role changed to pilot training by .  But it was finally shut down for good in  by which time a number of its buildings had already fallen into disuse. The video shows Daniel and his companions running at dferent points after hearing other people in the building. At the end of the video, Daniel tells viewers: “That was RAF Fenton, AKA Leeds East Airport. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get into the tower because security rolled up right beside us. “The place is creepy but an amazing explore.”  After posting the video on YouTube, some viewers asked Daniel for more information about the site but he told them the buildings he visited were now gone. One wrote: “Cool abandoned place in Leeds I will be going there to paint.” Daniel replied: “The place is unfortunately gone but was a super cool place.” Another added: “Sad to see, flew here a couple of times as an air cadet.” Daniel responded: “Ohh thats amazing thank you for sharing and yes itaposs a shame itaposs gone.” Someone  said: “I’m so glad I subscribed to this channel.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World War NazisPhotographyPlanesFrontline Fighters\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old mum of two - who is a full-time carer to disabled son Tommy, aged  - has now lived without heating for more than a month.“Itaposs really upsetting because I feel like a failure of a mother. I can choose between keeping my house warm at the moment and feeding the kids. “And the kids need to be fed but they need to be warm, it’s quite upsetting. No one should have to choose between feeding or eating.” Beth is one of the . million UK householders whose heating is powered by oil as her home in the rural hamlet of Dartshill, Somerset does not have a mains gas supply.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Her problem started as the cost to heat her family home, which she rents, rose sharply - from £ to £ for  litres, to fill less than half the tank.The cost of living crisis has left the mum, Tommy, five, and Gabby, three, forced to share a bed each night.They have a tiny electric heater to warm the bedroom they share, but in the evenings, they can see their breath in their living room when the temperature drops. Desperate to keep her children warm, Beth bundles them up in jumpers and scarves at home - but Tommy, who is autistic, struggles to wear the outfits. She says: “We’re wearing a lot of extra layers and having to sleep in the same bed to keep warm. “I shut the bedroom door to keep our body heat in but as soon as we got downstairs, it is freezing and we’re all shivering. “It’s a very old draughty cottage, I woke up the other morning around  am to find ice around the windowsill. “We’re wearing a lot more clothes, which means a lot more washing and a backlog of clothes as we wait days for things to dry. “It’s also a choice when it comes to hot water -the kids have a bath, I can’t have a shower as well.” She added: “I have no money and I’m worried about the kids getting ill because it is so cold. “February and March can be the coldest months so I needed to get something done quickly.” Tommy, aged five, is “very delayed” and has to wear specic clothes, meaning he doesn’t like wearing the extra layers.Beth is unable to work after becoming his full-time carer due to his severe epilepsy and the family rely on Universal Credit to get by.She previously tried to get a loan but was refused as she still owes around £ from the last loan she received. “I’ve tried everything. I even tried to get a grant in my local area but I heard nothing back,” the mum said. She also claims disability allowance to support him, who spent nine weeks in hospital in , suffering constant seizures. He has to wear a helmet to protect himselfhe falls, and mum Beth is on constant alert for his seizures. “Because of his epilepsy and autism, he is very delayed, and he doesn’t understand why we need to wear these extra clothes,” added Beth. “So trying to keep him warm it’s really dficult, he’s used to having heating and now we don’t have it. “It’s very frustrating for him.”  The desperate mum recently turned toGoFundMeto help cover the £ bill - where one kindhearted stranger donated £ anonymously.The hike in the price of oil comes amid a cost of living crisis with Beth’s rent recently rising by £ per month - a rise she will struggle to cover. Struggling Brits are bracing for further financial turmoil this spring - with tax rises, wage cuts and soaring bills set to batter household budgets further.The cost of living crisis could see families suffer a £, a year average hit, The Mirror exclusively revealed today - in a further blow to families such as Bethaposs.Low-income families are set to be the most affected by the crisis - with no spending they can cut back on. She said: “We scrape by every month, it’s dficult. With Universal Credit, I don’t knowthey’ll cover the rent increase. “As a single mum on benefits, £ is a lot of money. “Tommy’s school is about half an hour away so I do an hour-round journey every day to get him there. “It got to the point where I was desperate for heating and I just had to set up a GoFundMe page.” She plans to donate any excess to the Daisy Garland charity, that supported her family while Tommy was in the hospital.Donate to Beth’sGoFundMehere.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsOil pricesSingle mumEpilepsyAsperger’s syndromeEnergy bills\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tests continued tonegative and the family felt nobody could explain what was wrong with him. Brian was found aposunable to moveapos on May  last year after bending down to wash his hands. Little did we know that our world was about to be blown apart, Alyson said. My dad suddenly was unable to move and we had to call an ambulance. It came to light that my dadaposs femur and hip had split open but there was no logical reason for this he hadnapost banged himself or had a fall. On the May  after much investigation it came to light that my dad had myeloma and was very poorly. He wasnapost even awake so I couldn’t tell him how much I loved him and that he had to fight. The next day, Alyson said she had to discuss a do-not-resuscitate order with her fatheraposs consultant. What a shocker, she said, we only found out about the cancer the day before and he only came into hospital  days before that. How can things be this bad so quick  May  was one of the worst days of our le, Alyson continued. We got a call to say come in, Dad wasnapost going to be pulling through, and would not make the weekend. To this point we had all been restricted to seeing my dad because of Covid but now we were allowed to be by his side. I cannot emphasise what a shock this week had been to us all. How quick the tide had turned in our le. What I can tell you is from my own point of view the heart-breaking pain I felt, Iaposd never felt pain like it and it was like I could not breathe and my world had crashed into a million pieces.  Sadly, a lot of families go through this journey leading to their diagnosis. Another reason why knowledge, awareness, training and earlier diagnosis is so important. Myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that occurs in the bone marrow. It currently affects more than , people in the UK. On average,  people are diagnosed with Myeloma every day in the UK. Alyson said: My dad had fallen sick in October  and despite many tests ran nothing came to light. Even a few weeks before May st, Dad had more tests done and still nothing had shown up, even in the blood tests for cancer. Going back through my dadaposs medical history it is now thought that his myeloma could go back  years when it was at the apossmoulderingapos stage but right up to him being hospitalised nothing ever came to light. The myeloma had remained undetected. Another reason why a better diagnosis system needs to be found. Despite being told he had just days to live, Brian went home in July - a day that Alyson says is one they never thought we would see. Brian is said to have responded well to chemotherapy - but the damage done to his body cannot be reversed. He is on chemotherapy every day to give him some extra time. Another dficult side to Myeloma is that it does y from person to person and besides the cancer, myeloma can come with many other complications. For my dad it is his heart and lungs. Now Alyson and husband Alan, who run Alan Yates Music, are planning to do weekly gigs throughout March this year in a bid to fund the research into a cure for Myeloma.Alyson is immunocompromised, meaning her immune system is extremely weak and she is at higher risk of contracting Covid-.Myeloma may become curable but funds are required for that and funds are required to help those in today’s society where there isnapost a cure, she said. She said she wanted to support Myeloma UK to help fund research into a cure and to raise awareness of Myeloma so “it doesn’t happen to anybody . We went through a horrendous journey as a family and the thought of another family going through that… I just can’t”. Myeloma UK is the only organisation in the UK exclusively dedicated to Myeloma and its related conditions. They rely almost entirely on voluntary donations and fundraising. Their ultimate goal is to find a cure for Myeloma and until then aim to help every patient live well with the diagnosis for as long as possible.To find out more about myeloma and the work of Myeloma UK click here.

Production of popular items such as Fruit Pastilles, Toffee Crisps and mini eggs will be moved to Nestle plants in the Czech Republic, Poland and Bulgaria. While other items will be produced in Halax.  The factory, which first opened in , makes all the Rolos in the world and also produces a range of sweets that includes Caramac and Munchies. GMB national officer Ross Murdoch said: “Closing this profit-making site and shting production to Europe is completely unacceptable. This will have a devasting impact on workers and their families. “Meanwhile transporting finished products from sites in Europe back to the UK - where they are consumed - will result in signicant additional road and sea miles increasing pollution and environmental damage.  “GMB and Unite will now speak to members in Fawdon and find out what they want to do next. We will give them whatever support and resources they need to fight this.” Joe Clarke, a national officer at Unite the Union, said: “Unite and its membership are bitterly disappointed that alternative proposals to keep the site within Nestle Fawdon open have been rejected.  “We are currently seeking further information in relation to the proposal, and we will enter into dialogue on next steps imminently.” A Nestle spokesman said: “The consultation around the changes we proposed in April  is still ongoing. “We said from the outset that we wanted to provide adequate time and space for these discussions and it is only right that they are held directly with our employees and trade unions and not in public.

And itaposs believed he has already started getting ready to take over and has been to a number of trusteesapos meetings. Measuring , sq ft, Althorp House boasts  rooms and a portrait gallery. Following Dianaaposs death in  she was buried on a small island on the wider estate in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake.  Although the monarchy has now changed to put sons and daughters on an equal footing in terms of ascending to the throne, British primogeniture law has not been changed for peers such as dukes and earls.This means Louis will inherit Althorp rather than his oldest sister Kitty, who married -year-old businessman Michael Lewis in a grand ceremony in Italy last year.In a previous interview, Kitty, , said: Primogeniture can be a tricky topic because as times are changing, attitudes are as well. Weaposve grown up understanding that itaposs Louis to inherit, and Louis will do an incredible job. Meanwhile, her father Earl Spencer suggested it would go against the tradition of Althorp House to overlook his son. He said in : I would be totally relaxed about Kitty inheriting it, but...I chose Kitty it would be against all the tradition that goes with Althorp.

It was bought for just £ in  by the airportaposs chief executive Suzannah Harvey when British Airways retired its fleet early due to the pandemic, and has been a labor of love ever since. Suzannah said: I paid a pound for her, and we have a certain obligation to maintain it as is practical for public use. The company has had to spend nearly £, getting her prepped and ready here, but I think itaposs money well spent and it preserves her for future generations.  Most of the original structure has stayed the same but the transformation has included stripping out the economy section to create the events space and turning the gallery into a bar. A full rewiring with custom lighting has been done while it also took one man a whole week and a half to give it a good clean inside and out. Suzannah described the renovation process as a “long old slog”.  “She came into us in October , and at the time I rather naively thought weaposd have her up and running by the following Easter,” she said. Weaposve had such tremendous support from everybody. All the contractors, all the people that have volunteered who are current BA  engineers - and here we are finally. “Sheaposs ready and sheaposs good to go. The Negus entered the British Airways fleet on  February , operating , flights - flying for , hours over nearly  million miles.  Its last passenger flight was from Miami to Heathrow on  April, .Anyone now wanting to host a party onboard will have to pay more than £, an hour but Suzannah said they had been inundated with enquiries - including from Netflix.Suzannah added: The vision has finally come to fruition, with overwhelming support from volunteers including current BA engineers and half a million pounds of investment later, Negus  is finally ready.  Preserved for many years to come and future generations, Negus is the only bespoke events  in the world. Cotswold Airport is family owned and operated and is the largest privately owned airport in Europe having a runway only m shorter than Bristol International.

The laced brownies were allegedly stored by staff after they tried to deliver them to an empty home and there was noaddress on the parcel, according to posts on Instagram.It is not clear how the postman came into contact with the treats, which were kept inside a box labelled aposEdibles by Pablochocobarapos.

Text accompanying the Instagram Stories clip — which was later uploaded to TikTok by a dferent user — explains why the brownies had been eaten: We had a delivery of them with noaddress and the house was empty and they were in our office for a month so we opened them and they got given out. They were eaten between .-.am. The viral video has received over , likes on the app as Londoners found it hilarious that their postman had ended up in such a state.

Despite the backlash, headteacher Brian Mulheran, of the Citipointe Christian College, has doubled down and given parents an extra two weeks to sign their children up. The contract was sent to families last Friday and said the college will only enrol the student on the basis of the gender that corresponds to their biological sex. It also asserted that homosexuality, along with bestiality, incest and paedophilia, was sinful. One teacher, who also has a student at the college, has already resigned saying young people within the LGBTQ+ community deserve to feel safe while at school. Helen Clapham Burns was also a teacher at the school in Carindale, Australia, but quit on Monday saying she couldnapost continue to work for a school that would do that to children.  Mrs Burns said: Iaposm heartbroken. I feel like Iaposve let them down that Iaposm having to leave. But I have to let those queer kids know that there are Christians out there that love them and arenapost hiding behind Bible verses and are letting them know that they are safe with me. As an educator, my priority is to make sure that each child that I interact with feels safe. When a child tells us, with tears in their eyes, that they donapost feel safe, what are we doing  Mr Mulheran made a video for parents about the contract. In it he said he had listened to their concerns and wanted them to make the right decisions for themselves. The declaration of faith has been in place for the whole of last year, he said.  We want families to consider this ethos so that they can make the right decisions for themselves. He added: We have always held these Christian beliefs and we have tried to be fair and transparent to everyone in our community by making them clear in the enrolment contract. We are seeking to maintain our Christian ethos and to give parents and students the right to make an informed choice about whether they can support and embrace our approach to Christian education. Citipointe does not judge students on their sexuality or gender identity and we would not make a decision about their enrolment in the College simply on that basis.  A group of parents has said they want to file a complaint to the Human Rights Commission, arguing they were not consulted about the contract and that the college was discriminating against students on the basis of sexuality and gender identity. One parent who is asked not to be named said: The contract they put out is so blatantly damaging to anyone within the school who identies within the LGBTQI umbrella are not of their highest concern. But nor is anybody  who believes in standing up against this kind of discrimination, because the contract makes it clear that any kind of act that goes against this belief is something that can be disciplined. Federal Member for Moncref, Angie Bell, told ABC Radio in Brisbane she disagreed with the college lumping students who are unsure about their sexuality or unsure about their gender identity ... with the likes paedophiles and adulterers. No school child should be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, their gender identity, their pregnancy status, or their relationship status, which are the four elements that are in that section of the Sex Discrimination Act, she said.Religious organisations also have the right to practise their faith … without a doubt … notitaposs done in a discriminatory fashion. This is not  anymore … this is a new year, this is a new decade, this is a new Australia and there is no room.

But when she started dated one of the worldaposs most eligible bachelors, Prince Harry, she was determined to keep things quiet while she worked outhe was The One.The couple successfully kept their relationship a secret for five months, flying between Canada and London to see each other, enjoying cosy nights in at his Kensington Palace cottage. But they knew it was only a matter of time before their perfect, private bubble burst. When news that Harry had been secretly dating the Suits star was leaked, they had only a few hours to prepare before it appeared on the front pages.  But the realisation that this was aposher new leapos, terried Meghan, claims royal journalists, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. In their unofficial biography Finding Freedom, the authors share details of what happened on the night the couple were told their time in hiding was up.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. They wrote: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours. They had little time to think because there was only a couple of paparazzi in Toronto but it wouldnapost be long before photographers flew in from New York and LA, all hoping to get that first picture of the happy couple. Harry was inundated with calls from staff who encouraged him toto London as soon as possible since he had a smaller security team than normal. But, he refused to leave. Scobie and Durand claim that while Meghan was nervous about what was to come, she was relieved that the secrecy and lies to friends and family would be coming to an end. They said: Prior to meeting Harry, the only times she experiences cameras were on a set or on a red carpet. The security was necessary. Shortly after the news broke, a photographer from an LA-based photo agency had scaled the fence into her back garden and waited for Meghan by her car, hoping to get a picture before she headed out to run errands. Meghan was terried and called the police. aposThis is how itaposs always going to be, isnapost it apos, she said to a friend.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Lalia, a mixed-breed dog, has been living on the streets of Cario unable to use her back legs.

The animal welfare organisation, who work with sick, injured and disabled animals worldwide, wants to rehome Lalia in the UK - and already have a flight booked for her. However, as she has received no online interest from any potential owners, her spot on the plane might remain empty at take off.A statement on Twitter reads: “Laila will miss her flightwe donapost find a suitable foster this week.“She cannot thrive in a shelter environment - she really needs a home.” Lalia is currently being fostered in Egypt - but is ready to travel as soon as a new owner comes forward.

She would rather not live with children or cats. “Shelter le is particularly dficult for dogs like Laila with disabilities, so we really would like for her to travel as soon as possible.  “She is incontinent and will require bladder expression three or four times a day.

I’m a mum working from a wobbly table in the kitchen. So I was surprised to find out there is one thing we agree on: our attitude towards ­children and gadgets.Earlier this week the Manchester United star revealed his -year-old son Cristiano Jnr – who presumably could have anything money can buy – isn’t allowed a phone, despite constantly pestering him for one.Ronaldo warned of the dangers of being “obsessed” with technology and shared a story that most parents with young children will know only too well – little ones demanding phones. Speaking about tech, Ronaldo said: “Definitely it helps a lot. It helped me and the people here, all the world, and I think we have to take advantage of that but we shouldn’t be obsessed with it.”  He went on: “My oldest child is going to be  years old soon and he asks me every time, ‘Daddy, can I have a phone, can I have a phone, can I have a phone ’ I say to him, ‘Cristiano, you have time.’” I can’t believe he’s been able to hold out for so long. My six-year-old asks, on an almost daily basis,he can have a phone, insisting all his friends have one. The answer is obviously no – he’s far too young and I know most of his friends don’t own one – but nonetheless it is a source of contention. The few times I’ve given him my smartphone to play games or watch a show on, there’s a full-blown meltdown when it comes to getting it back.  When I think about ­children and gadgets, I often recall the words of Steve Jobs, when he was askedhis kids loved one of his greatest inventions: the iPad.He said: “They haven’t used it. We limit the amount of technology our children use at home.” See, even the great Jobs didn’t let his kids loose on gadgets. Technology is important but it’s far better for kids to be creative, make up their own games and, where possible, play outside. That’s what childhood should be about, not being glued to a screen. So now when my son whines, I have the perfect reply. If it’s good enough for Ronaldo’s son not to have a phone, then it’s good enough for you.

People working as cashiers in supermarkets and discount shops are often faced with disgruntled customers, and anyone who has worked a retail job knows exactly how tough it is.But thanks to one woman on TikTok, those of us who donapost work in these positions can now see what itaposs like firsthand, as former Wilko employee Holly Laing has dedicated her account to sharing the funniest and most irritating customer interactions sheaposs had while on the clock. Posting on her account @holly_laing, the experienced shop-floor worker revealed her biggest pet peeve when it comes to customers is the number of mistakes they make while paying - and one particular incident saw her running after someone who had walked out before their payment was processed.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Holly revealed the introduction of contactless payments has become a nightmare for cashiers, as people will tap their card and begin walking away before the till has accepted their payment - which can lead to complicated matterstheir card is declined. Acting out the experience in one video, Holly told the fictional customer that their shopping came to £, and the shopper - who was also played by Holly in the sketch - said: Right cheers. Contactless  Thanks. After tapping their card, the customer walked out of the store, leaving Holly to chase after them to get them to come back and try to pay again. She said: Hey sir  Excuse me, sir ! You didnapost pay properly, it didnapost go through. Do you want to just put your card in the machine this time  Hollyaposs videos have also touched on how annoying it is when customers attempt to hand cashiers their card to pay instead of just using the pin-pad themselves, as well as a more recent pet peeve that has arisen since the Covid- pandemic, with people being warier than ever about using cash.The woman explained in another clip that when customers do decide to use cash, they sometimes ask the cashier to put the change directly into their wallet because they donapost want to touch it. Impersonating the customer, Holly said in her video: Oh ... would you mind just putting it back in [my wallet]  I just donapost want to touch it. To which Holly then fumed: Donapost pay with cashyou don’t wanna touch it! Hollyaposs videos have been resonating with her , followers, and many commenters who also work in the service industry shared their own irritating interactions with customers. One person said: The worst thing is when you ask them to insert their card the second time but they tap anyway andit doesn’t work. While another added: Someone sneezed in their hand then used that same hand to give me the money... And someone  posted: I once had to chase after a customer and he went into another shop.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTokViralFunny ha ha viralWilko\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But one man on Reddit has revealed he lied for five years about his own engagement, as he told his family he had proposed to his now-we during a romantic meal a few months after heaposd actually got down on one knee. The reason he lied  Because heaposd actually proposed during his own sisteraposs wedding. Sharing his story anonymously, the man explained his sister had enjoyed a lavish destination wedding five years ago that her husbandaposs parents had paid for and the location was so romantic he decided to pop the question to his girlfriend - and then hide it from his family.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. He said: My sister got married five years ago. Her husbandaposs parents were quite rich and they paid for a destination wedding for five days. They even paid for the flights and the stay for all the immediate family members. Back then, that was hugely romantic and it felt like a fairytale. Although we are doing much better financially now, back then I was sure that I would never be able to do something like that. I didnapost even plan to do this, but I was caught up in the moment and asked my girlfriend to marry me. She said yes but we did not say anything to anyone. I did not want to step on any toes. A few months later, I brought an engagement ring and we told everyone that I had proposed after a romantic meal at home and that was that. However, the cat was let out of the bag five years later when the family went on holiday to the same location, and the manaposs we spilt the beans to his sister while drunk.  He added: A few months ago, we went on a vacation to the same place my sister got married. It was my sister, her husband, her two kids, me, and my we. We were getting drunk and having fun when my we told them that I had proposed to her outside this very restaurant all those years ago. My sister was p***ed and she stormed out. My we feels guilty for letting the cat out of the bag. My brother-in-law also feels that it was cheap of me to use his parentsapos money for a proposal. The man said his sister is now refusing to talk to him - but he thinks she should let it go. He said: Itaposs been weeks and my sister is still cold towards us. I told her it happened years ago and to just let it go. She said that she is hurt, and that was supposed to be her fabulous wedding. She says that the place and time is now memorable to us as the place we agreed to get married and that it will never be remembered as the place she actually got married. She was very mad that I hurt her feelings and now I am just asking her to let it go. Commenters on the Reddit post were largely on the manaposs side, as they said he would have been out of lineheaposd proposed in front of his sisteraposs wedding guests, but doing so discreetly was fine. One said: Normally I’d say youaposre the a**hole, but you didn’t do it publicly in front of everyone. You did it privately. Nobody had hurt feelings until now. While another added: I came in here expecting to say you were in the wrong, but in this case, I think your sister is making too big a deal of this. And a third posted: Your sister is acting immature. Your secret proposal does not in any way affect her marriage or memories. Sheaposs being dramatic and causing hostility for no good reason because no actual harm was done.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditProposalsengagedMarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tanisha Clay @tanishaclayyhas spoken on TikTok about having always wanted children, and how one day she decided to allow herself the pleasure of looking at baby clothes before starting her own baby closet - now sheaposs expecting her own little one. The TikToker is encouraging other women who want children one day to do the same, promising nothing will go to waste as any unused items will always get passed onto friends and other expecting mums.  Okay hear me out. If youaposre a girl who wants a baby one day, maybe not today, just one day, just hear me out, because I have a tip that is going to bring you joy and a lot less of a headache later, she told her followers. If you’re the kind of girl whose eyes light up when you walk past the baby section, let me just tell you why you should stop walking and go in. Tanisha asked her followers whether theyaposd ever been to a baby shower and seen the mum-to-be opening present after present of newborn baby clothes, but what happens when the baby is too big to fit in the newborn clothing, she asked. Instead, the mum-to-be came up with her own plan, which she started long before she fell pregnant herself, called the baby closet. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Rule number one is that the item needs to be gender neutral, she explained. Rule number two is thatit’s for a boy I need to be able to pair it with a bow to make it fit a girl. Tanisha went on to say rule number three is that anything she canapost use when she has her own child should be passed on to someone  at a baby shower. There’s actually a fourth rule in that it has to be sized three to  months. No newborn, she added. Tanisha said she always shops baby clothes when theyaposre in the sale, making the exception when she finds something thataposs just too cute to pass up. I do not purposely go looking for baby clothes, I let the baby clothes find me and it has brought me so much joy and anticipation while me and my husband are waiting for the right time to have a baby, she added. The TikToker told her followers about the baby closet back in August last year, however she has since revealed that after a long time trying, she and her husband are now expecting their first baby. Huge congratulations Tanisha, and what a well dressed baby you will have.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Itaposs therefore somewhat unsurprising that, after breathless anticipation leading up to the launch, McDonaldaposs fans have been sharing their thoughts about the Chicken Big Mac Burger and whether or not it could ever live up to the instantly recognisable flavours of the OG.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Many reviews have so far been pretty positive, with ious happy customers hailing it in turn as a triumph,a banger, and the best thing since sliced bread. One particularly enamoured Instagram user wrote: I’ve been waiting for this day for so long that when my boyfriend suggested having the new Chicken Big Mac for dinner, of course, I wasn’t going to say no, It’s a solid   for me. It tastes incredible and needed to become a permanent addition to the menu.However, some have noted that itaposs quite a messy burger, with one person tweeting: chicken big mac is v delicious. but the chicken burgers are not the right shape for that stack. Absolute chaos eating it. All layers sliding. Another gave the gloried mayo chicken meal a so-so   ranking, remarking that their initial hesitations of the meal being a little dry do still stand, with the burger needing something extra to give it flavour and moisture. In a bid to combat said dryness - and in a move which could well help those grappling with the aforementioned sliding layers - one TikToker has advised their followers to dash the dry top bun, emphasising no one needs that in their lives. In a video that has since been viewed more than .K times at the time of writing, TikTok user Laura Crawford could be seen removing the seeded top bun before flipping the middle bun on top.Laura has declared the hack to be the best way to eat the Chicken Big Mac, and plenty of her followers are certainly interested in giving it a go. One even suggested replacing the top bun with a layer of fries, which may well be a step too far for some Maccies purists. Of course, numerous inevitable comparisons have been made to the beef Big Mac, with one huge fan asserting that ya don’t f*ck about with a classic. Others have argued that Big Mac sauce is much more suited towards beef than chicken, with one tweeting that it overpowers the chicken a bit. Another reflected that the burger would be better with the original McChicken sandwich Mayo in instead of the Big Mac sauce. However, in his recent review, the Mirroraposs Kyle OaposSullivan found that the sauce went very nicely indeed with the burger, writing: Just like any Big Mac, the first thing you taste is that creamy special sauce and it works incredibly well with the chicken. I was concerned about the Chicken Big Mac being too dry but to my surprise, it was moist enough and lashings of sauce were a bonus. Those keen to form their own opinions on the burger everyone is talking about will need to get down to their local drive-thru sharpish, with the temporary item only making a fleeting appearance on the menu up until March .

According to this mum, the party is due to take place this coming Sunday at an activity centre with a climbing wall, with the kids heading for some food afterwards.Taking to Mumsnet, the surprised mother explained that they accepted the invitation some weeks back, and have already bought a present and card.However, she was left a little taken aback after being sent an unexpected message from the birthday childaposs parent less than one week before the big day.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Calling upon her fellow mums for advice, she said: Weaposve been sent a message yesterday from birthday childaposs parent last night which says that all children under eight must be supervised by an adult each, which is ok with me I donapost mind stayingbut that in order to stay and supervise we have to buy a full-price adults ticket, which costs £! Wondering whether this was a usual request - especially when made so close to the big day - the slightly peeved parent admitted that it seems a bit of a cheek to me! In the comments, she went on to explain that it is only a small party of maybe eight or so children. All of the kids are under the age of eight, except for the birthday child, meaning all parents will have to stay and pay.She added: I suspect most parents were planning on staying regardless as theyaposre quite young but I donapost think anyone would have expected to fork out £ for the privilege! Many commenters completely understood her reservations, with one user even advising that she would call the place myself and check, addingtrue I would withdraw and do something  instead. Another confessed theyaposd be pretty shocked by that! wondering whether the parent has only just realised the cost oritaposs a case of poor communication from the venue.

Soon-to-be mum-of-two Ashlee recently celebrated her gender reveal, where family and friends gathered to see her pop a balloon to reveal whether her unborn baby would be a girl or a boy. Ashlee @dinkymisspretty , from the United States, already has a son, so was absolutely overjoyed and overcome with emotion when she popped the balloon and saw pink confetti flying in front of her face, signalling sheaposs having a baby girl - or so she first thought. Posting a clip to her TikTok, Ashlee showed the moment she burst the balloon at her gender reveal, andyou look closely you can see the confetti coming out of the balloon is actually blue, but at that exact moment, her mum decided to shoot a cannon of pink confetti right in her face.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Itaposs hard to understand why any mum would want to play with her own daughteraposs emotions like that, especially when theyaposre pregnant. Ashlee can be seen jumping up and down with joy at seeing the pink confetti, only for her face to turn to thunder when her little boy came over to tell her what her mum had done. Clearly you can see I wanted a girl so bad and in that moment I felt like I hit the lottery, the mum says in the clip, adding: Then here comes my son making me realise its really another boy. I was p***ed. This is the only one I can actually be okay with the parent being mad. Cause why play like that, one follower commented, to which Ashlee responded: Right, I wasnapost mad it was a boy I was mad they had me think it was a girl. Another added: Now see this reaction is valid because you can’t play with a pregnant woman’s emotions like that. I’m sure you’ll have a beautul baby boy though.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

One woman has been left scratching her head over what could be inside a safe she uncovered recently in her new home.A TikTok user named Liz, who posts under @imthefookinlizardking has gone viral online after sharing a clip of her discovery.Posting on the video-sharing app, they explained: I bought a house in November and just found a hidden safe in the floor. The house was built in the late s. How the heck do I open it  She went on to explain that she found the safe while hoovering the carpet, as she noticed little frayed pieces on the floor.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Liz has since messaged several locksmiths and the company that originally made the safe to find outthey could help her open it. Lots of locksmiths told her that they would not mess with a floor safe. More than six million people have since watched the video and are desperate to know whataposs inside the safe. After speaking to numerous people, the TikToker was put in touch with a man named Jim, who is known for being able to crack dficult safe combinations. Liz made an appointment for Jim to come out and take a look at the safe, meanwhile social media users couldnapost help but speculate about what was inside. Some thought there might be a secret tunnel under the floor, while others joked the womanaposs dog looked suspicious like he knew more than what he was letting on. However, everyone was eventually disappointed to learn that the safe was empty. In a finale video on TikTok, Liz showed Jim opening the safe - only to find nothing inside. Tragic. Liz didnapost seem too upset though, knowing that she now had a cool safe under the floor she could use whenever she wanted.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The wreckage of the British explorer’s ship has been sitting on the seafloor in US waters for two and a half centuries, but was finally discovered after a two decade search by archaeologists.It was discovered in Newport Habor, Rhode Island, where marine archaeologists have been investigating a number of th century shipwrecks. The Endeavour laid in its watery grave there thanks to British forces. During the American War of Independence in , the Brits purposely sank the ship. The archaeologists have been on site since , and today, the Australian National Maritime Museum chief executive Kevin Sumption confirmed that James Cook’s vessel had been identied.  Speaking to reporters, Sumption said: “Itaposs arguably one of the most important vessels in Australiaaposs maritime history. “I am satisfied that this is the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australiaaposs maritime history. “Based on archival and archaeological evidence, Iaposm convinced itaposs the Endeavour. “Itaposs an important historical moment, as this vesselaposs role in exploration, astronomy and science applies not just to Australia, but also Aotearoa New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.”  However, one American expert who was involved in the discovery has said it is “premature” to definitely say this ship is the Endeavour. Dr Kathy Abbass, of Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project , called the report “premature” and was left frustrated, accusing the Maritime Museum of being “in breach of the contract” after it claimed the news to the public. She told ABC: “What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identication.  “RIMAP recognises the connections between Australian citizens of British descent and the Endeavour but RIMAPaposs conclusions will be driven by a proper scientic process and not Australian emotions or politics.” THe claims have been made that the shipwreck is the infamous Endeavour due to a number of reasons. The structural details and shape of the ship closely match historic plans of the Endeavour.  Specically, the construction of the keel on the bottom of the ship, and joinery on its bow at the front, are identical to those seen in th century plans. On top of that, theof the hull of the wreckage is almost identical to that recorded for the Endeavour. Also historical evidence suggested the ship was sunk in the area, along with four other British ships. However, only  per cent of the vessel remains and researchers are now working to protect and preserve what’s left.  Sumption added: “We will continue to investigate and look closely with maritime experts at Rhode Island about the future of this site and what should happen to this site but certainly protection is what weaposre working towards right now.” Researchers are currently finalising their report on the find, which is still ye to be peer reviewed and published. The Endeavour originally was launched in  under the name the Earl of Pembroke. It wasn’t until  that it was renamed and prepared for its scientic voyage to the Pacic.

The ship was later sold to private owners, and renamed as Lord Sandwich before it was sunk by the same nation it served.

The moving scene took place outside Rio Piedras Medical Centre in the Puerto Rican capital San Juan on the morning of February . According to the news site El Universal, the -year-old homeless man passed away in the night and the dog stayed by his side. The loyal pooch even remained on the bench as personnel from the Institute of Forensic Sciencestook the body away, gazing at the morgue vehicle as it disappeared from view. However, medical staff took a liking to the dog, and Dr Jose Antonio Herrera Dalmau reportedly decided to adopt the ownerless animal. He told the newspaper El Nuevo Dia: I have already made an appointment to see a vet because the dog has a leg injury. It is not broken, but it has an injury. The hospital doctor added that he was thinking of calling the pooch Leo. He said he was told about the dog by a colleague and went outside to take a look.The doctor, who says he is a dog lover, explained that Leo looks a lot like a pet pooch he had several years ago called Reina.

The two other hikers alerted mountain rescue and  responders found Brkic with North tightly curled around him for warmth. In a statement on Facebook, the Croatian mountain rescue service said: “Friendship and love between man and dog know no boundaries. “North passed without injuries, but his friend, a young mountaineer, was not so lucky. He curled up with him and warmed him with his body. “His loyalty did not stop even from the arrival of the saviour, he was one of us guarding his man for  hours.” Velebit is the largest mountain range in Croatia at nearly , metres above sea level. Mountain rescue have warned against taking dogs for hikes in poor conditions particularly during the winter months. Mr Brkic described his dog as a “real miracle”, reports the Express.

All of Argyll and Bute#s secondary schools were allocated up to  places on the programme.#Activities were delivered to achieve increased confidence, self-esteem and resilience, building le-skills, encouraging self-respect, introducing coping mechanisms, improving mental, physical and emotional wellbeing and developing aspirations for the future.#There were many outcomes achieved and positive impacts which included  young people taking part in outdoor learning experiences that challenged them.#Forty five young people gained SQA Health and Wellbeing awards,  young people achieved Dynamic Youth Awards and  young people achieved Hi awards.#Eighty per cent reported their wellbeing improved,  per cent increased their re-engagement with education and  per cent saw their choices and behaviour improve.#The report also gave an update on the No-one Left Behind employability delivery model which continues to operate in the area.The spokesperson added: #We continued working with learners through another year of Covid lockdown [in  ] and supported a further  people via online and non-face to face provision to help them develop their skills and move into positive destinations, improve their chances of employment, address barriers and challenges and gain accredited qualications.#This resulted in six learners entering further education and five people entering into employment. We continue to work with the other six learners who are still working towards positive destinations by the end of March .#PIC:Young people from across Argyll and Bute can achieve accredited awards and experience quality outdoor learning opportunities while developing personal and team skills.

And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

and the former toll-house in Belhaven is also still there today.Kirkhill Toll in Dunbar has been demolished, nor is there any longer a toll-house in Broxburn.There have been ergent opinions whether there was also a turnpike toll in East Linton, with some suspecting that there had been a mix-up with the undoubted toll-house in West Linton, Borders [still standing and the Olde Toll Tea House today].Both places were referred to just as ‘Linton’ in Victorian times, confounding the postmen and delivery boys for many years until the names were changed.A key source about East Lothian toll-houses and milestones is Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire.This map clearly shows a ‘Toll Barr’ just to the south-east of the village of Linton, situated at a crossroads to be able to charge toll in both directions.A toll in the vicinity of Linton is referred to already in Taylor  Skinner’s  Survey of the Roads.The next source is the  Itinerary of Scotland, which mentions Linton Toll-bar, just at the east of the village.Importantly, the name-book of the - Ordnance Survey [OS    ] lists the house as “A toll gate at which road dues are collected between Linton and Dunbar.“It is the property of the County road trustees, and is at present occupied by Gilbert Miller.”Thus it can be concluded that East Linton did, indeed, have a turnpike toll-house, probably dating back at least to the mid-th century when the tollbars were set up and the houses constructed along the main turnpike road.Like the other tolls mentioned here, it was a casualty to the railways being constructed, reducing road traffic very considerably and starving the toll-keepers out of existence in late Victorian times.But where is the old toll-house today There is no building on the main road past East Linton in any way resembling a toll-house, and the crossroads where it once stood has long since disappeared after a scheme to construct a bypass outside the village.Computerised super-imposition of a present-day map of East Linton onto Forrest’s  map indicates that the toll-house would be situated close to what is today Lauder Place.And, indeed, a stroll through those parts reveals the existence of the ‘Old Toll House’, accessed through a driveway from Lauder Place.A humble, single-story building just like the other East Lothian toll-houses, it has been signicantly extended at the back.By the present owner, it was identied as the former toll-house by the original deeds, which have since been mislaid.It would today have had a most tranquil situation, far from any of the major roads, had not the mainline railway been just a few feet away, with the trains roaring by with a deafening noise.When its present owner bought the old toll-house  years ago, it was in decent repair, albeit very small and cramped.Curiously, there was then a three foot square stone built room with a small window with iron bars, a prison cell perhaps, intended for people who refused to pay the toll But since the toll-keepers had no powers to imprison people, perhaps it was rather a whisky store, since the toll-keepers often doubled as low-level publicans It is also possible that the magistrates required a convenient holding-cell for local offenders before taking them to a burgh tolbooth.Since the ‘cell’ has long since been removed and the toll-house extensively renovated, with no original features remaining, we will never know.The East Lothian authorities built their toll-houses sturdy and strong, and the Old Toll House in East Linton is likely to stand for centuries to come.Jan

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media - the investigation will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.Hundreds of meetings between Scottish ministers and multinationals, wealthy iniduals and other influential organisations were left off the lobbying register in  due to loopholes in legislation, The Ferret can reveal. Analysis of Scottish Government ministers’ engagements in  shows that meetings, potentially of key public interest, were not in the register, including those between ministers and companies awarded multi-million pound UK and Scottish contracts to supply the NHS in the run-up to Covid-.  Read the full scale of unrecorded discussions here.Professional lobbyists, including former politicians, advisors and a former minister have met with Scottish Government representatives on behalf of clients  times since March , The Ferret can reveal. Scotland is home to dozens of public relations, think-tanks and consultancy firms, including several formed by or employing people who served in the upper echelons of government. Find out the whos who of professional lobbyists here.Questions have been raised over the power and influence of energy companies following analysis by The Ferret revealing how key sectors dominate Scottish lobbying. The Ferret categorised  organisations that lobbied Scottish Government ministers since the register was introduced in  to increase transparency. Read the full exclusive analysis here.Big business including oil and renewable energy, farming, fishing, finance and whisky dominated Scotland Office ministers’ meetings last year, analysis by The Ferret has found.   We looked at all external meetings logged in  by Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland, UK Government ministers for Scotland David Duguid and Iain Stewart, as well as Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, who was deputy Secretary of State until he resigned in May that year.   Read the full report exclusively here.The number of companies registered in tax havens investing in Scotland over the last decade has increased by nearly  per cent. Analysis of Scottish Government data by The Ferret found that in  there were  firms registered in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and British Virgin Islands operating, compared to  in .

They shared a flat in Glasgow before Russell’s move to Racing  in the summer of  and remain close. “I wouldn’t say he’s a maverick – I would say he reads the game dferently to pretty much any other  in the world,” said Price earlier this week, as he looked ahead to Scotland kicking off their  Six Nations campaign with an eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup clash against England on Saturday. Price and Russell will almost certainly be named as Nos  and  in Gregor Townsend’s team when it is announced at lunchtime today. “The space he sees and the skillset he has that enables him to pull off certain moves – the chips, the long balls, the passes – makes him unique,” Price continued.  “It’s just him. He’s a world-class . For me, my job is to try and help facilitate that as much as I can.  “He’s always looking for space. We’ve got a good relationship where we know what each other is thinking most of the time, which obviously helps.” When Price first broke into the Scotland team back in , there was concern in some quarters that he was too much of a free-spirit to play alongside Russell – but the -year-old has matured into an important leader of the side. That earned him his call-up to last summer’s Lions tour, and he believes the trip took his game to the next level.  Now he is determined to use his Lions experience to help Scotland make the leap from plucky underdogs capable of one-off victories against the top teams into genuine contenders for the Six Nations title. “You can pick up on things here and there, maybe little comments that players from other nations may have made while we were in South Africa about how they approach certain aspects of a game,” he explained. “That could be quite valuable – but that works both ways in terms of the opposition maybe knowing what some of us Scottish players could be thinking at certain moments.” The key to success in the Six Nations is no secret: it is a sprint rather than a marathon, so it is essential to start fast and then accelerate. With that in mind, Price believes Scotland can learn from last year’s campaign when they finished fourth in the table despite famous wins in London and Paris. “We had that great win at Twickenham, which was the first in  odd years, and we were in a great position the following week against Wales in terms of score-line, but they got it by a point come the end,” he said. “Ireland, again, was a three-point game. So, its just about putting it all together now. “Getting victories on the board in week one and week two puts you in a good position on the table, so thats what we will be trying to do,” he continued. “Thats what were doing in training now fine tuning and getting ourselves right for the first game because you cant look past the first game, its massive.  “If you get four or five wins then youre knocking at the door on that last weekend to see where you finish up. Hopefully  we can put it all together by drawing on the experiences from last year and the year before, then we should be in a good place come the last weekend.  “From an inidual and team point of view, having the confidence and the belief that we can beat these teams comes from the fact that we have beaten these teams. “The belief is certainly there thatwe can go out and implement how we want to play and our game-plan then we have the players, the ability and the skill level to come away with victories. “I dont know whether its arrogance, but its definitely a belief, a confidence. “Theres depth in every position now, which maybe has been lacking at times in the past, so there are no excuses because weve got it all there, weve got the training facilities, weve got everything in place for us to perform.  “Theres a lot of guys in good form who are looking to go out there and enjoy it and hopefully get off to the best start possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions. The success of DRS in Scotland, however, will depend on ensuring we get the details right, not just in our cities but in rural and island settings as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And that becomes the norm to live with, that stress and anxiety.”Mother-of-two Ms McMorrin said she became “trauma-bonded”, where it becomes normal to live with the trauma, and she tiptoed around trying not to upset her partner. vw,vw,px, px\"Ms McMorrin said she hopes telling her story will help other women in the same situation She said although the abuse was never physical, she wants to highlight the impact emotional abuse can have.“As a shadow victims minister, every week most days I speak to victims. Women who are in or have been in awful abusive relationships, unimaginable circumstances, and they’re treated appallingly by the courts, by the justice system,” she said.“It’s so important that for victims out there, the law understands that coercive emotional abuse is a very real thing that women face and take a long time to get over the trauma of it.”The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that among victims of domestic abuse, .% of women said they experienced non-physical abuse such as emotional or financial abuse.

Because he had affairs that he denied completely, would absolutely deny it to me and then delete the evidence.“Even after that I ask myself why I stayed. I don’t understand it myself, I don’t understand – why did I do that to myself and why did I do that to my children  And I don’t know that answer, quite honestly, but it took all my strength to leave.“It absolutely did, and I think that’s the nature of the weird state that you get into when you’re in a relationship like that.”Ms McMorrin said when she did find the strength to leave, she called a friend who told her she had to do it immediately.“She said, ‘you’ve got to Beyonce it. Imagine you’re Beyonce, you’ve got to go in there and you’ve just got to go. Don’t worry about everything, don’t worry about your stuff, don’t worry about your things. That’s material, you’ve just got to go’. And I did, that’s what I did,” the MP said.Abuse isnt always physical and can take many forms including emotional and financial.

You just need to say, ‘now I need to get out’, and go.“The other thing to remember is once you’ve gone it’s that that’s not the easy bit.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

These investments in clean energy will help grow the green economy and reduce Northern Ireland’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.”The Academy will be driven by a public-private partnership that includes Northern Regional College, Belfast politan College, Queen’s University Belfast, Ulster University and the University of Birmingham.A consortium of key industry players also involved includes Wrightbus, Energia, Translink, Firmus, and EP UK Investments.Speaking at the launch, Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Councillor William McCaughey said: “The announcement of this revolutionary Hydrogen Training Academy is welcome and timely, particularly as we heighten our focus on creating and sustaining long term economic recovery and growth in the aftermath of a global pandemic.“Mid and East Antrim is uniquely placed in Northern Ireland in terms of the key strengths and assets we boast in energy and cleantech that align with the ambition of net zero carbon targets. The Academy will support the development of the Ballymena area as a ‘hydrogen hub’ and continue to build upon our Borough’s reputation as a centre of excellence and the main focal point of the emerging Northern Ireland wide hydrogen economy.“I commend Council’s Elected Members and officers who, in collaboration with our public and private sector partners, have invested a huge amount of time and effort in bringing the project to this stage. I very much look forward to seeing the Academy grow and to witnessing the longer-term economic impact it will undoubtedly have in the coming years.“Today’s announcement along with future plans for investment in the iC Innovation and Cleantech Centre at St. Patrick’s Barracks and the recent announcement of pound million joint funding with QUB under the Northern Ireland Executive’s City and Growth Deals Complementary Fund for a Ballymena Integrated Green Hydrogen Hub further supports and cements our ambition.”Ian Luney, Commercial Director at EP UK Investments, said: “EPUKI is delighted to support Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, alongside other partners across the public and private sectors, in the development of the Hydrogen Training Academy in Ballymena. As the owners of Kilroot and Ballylumford Power Stations, we recognise the value of supporting innovation and training, particularly in emerging cleantech industries such as the hydrogen sector.“The production and use of hydrogen is part of our long-term vision for the Kilroot Energy Park. Upskilling existing and new employees through the academy will be crucial in enabling Northern Ireland to benefit from opportunities in a thriving hydrogen economy over the coming years and EPUKI look forward to contributing to that.”The launch of the Academy comes as Mid and East Antrim Borough Council welcomes the arrival of a new state-of-the-art training pod for the first cohort of trainees to use.Based at Silverwood Business Park, the H Gas Safe Lab is the first of two facilities for the Ballymena area and is targeted at the NI Gas Safe Register plumbing and heating industry to provide a competence testing space for work with commercial level equipment.The state-of-the-art facility is the first mixed-gas hydrogen-testing lab in the UK for Gas Safe engineers, with multiple systems to help reduce carbon footprints in houses and offices.Northern Regional College will house the second training facility focusing on the production of hydrogen through specialist training equipment. This facility will provide a technology familiarisation teaching space for all levels in the basics of green hydrogen.Graham Whitehurst MBE, Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force, explained how the Hydrogen Training Academy will play a “critical role” in training and upskilling existing employees as well as new trainees to a recognised professional competence standard required for the hydrogen sector.“Through the Hydrogen Training Academy and a range of other initiatives, led by our Manufacturing Task Force, Mid and East Antrim is cementing its position as a hub for SME innovation and commercialisation activity and a springboard for the future of the cleantech growth sector and industry.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1643818252873.jpg--covid_19___tue_2nd_february_figures.jpg?1643818252000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220202newscovid 19 wed 2nd february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

The former DUP leader said he had taken legal advice which meant he could order the checks to stop without the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive. His party are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had been agreed by the EU and the UK in order to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. However, unionists, who believe the arrangements are damaging to Northern Ireland’s position within the UK, have been critical. Currently, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Irelands ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and should not continue without the Executive’s approval. Today, Mr Poots said legal advice he had received confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitarychecks required approval from the Stormont Executive. This meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and that at a result a formal instruction had been issued to DAERA’ss permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on December ,  as of midnight tonight.

It is understood that an announcement could be made at around .pm this afternoon . The move means that deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle ONeill, also loses her position as the two roles are a joint office shared between Stormont’s two biggest parties. Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments. However, as there would be no First or Deputy First Minister in place, no new decisions could take place. That would mean that the current COVID- restrictions, including the wearing of masks would remain in place for the forseeable. Similarly, an energy scheme which would see , people receive a pound grant would be thrown into jeopardy while a scheduled apology for victims of historical abuse would be in doubt. Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. The SDLP’s Upper Bann MLA, Dolores Kellysaid the DUP’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland”. “Whatever community you’re from, whatever your background or beliefs, no one benefits from this cynical, and totally predictable, electioneering stunt,” she said. She added that the DUPs MLAs need to explain to people in our community, people who are struggling to cope with rising energy bills and to put food on the table, those and their loved ones who are facing an eternity on hospital waiting lists, people who are struggling to access a decent education for their children, why the DUP has done this at a critical juncture for politics here. The truth is that for the DUP, the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, she said. “This DUP drama has been concocted by Jeffrey Donaldson as a last desperate attempt to resuscitate their flagging poll numbers ahead of an Assembly election in May. We’ve come to expect shameless stunts from the DUP but putting ordinary people in the firing line is unforgivable. “People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. That has been the cycle of the last fteen years and it has delivered nothing but failure. It is time to break that cycle and offer people a dferent choice."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts upper newtownards road expected to remain closed for hours after pedestrian is knocked down","story":" Motorists have been advised to seek an alternative route for their journey.PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":true February   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Upper Newtownards Road is expected to remain closed for a number of hours due to a road traffic collision, in which a pedestrian has been knocked down.Motorists are advised that the Upper Newtownards Road in east Belfast has been closed in both directions between the Holywood Arches and the junction of the Beersbridge Road due to a serious road traffic collision earlier today .Trafficwatch NI tweeted: A pedestrian has been knocked down on the Newtownards at the Junction of Ravenscroft Ave. Emergency services are in attendance - Road users are advised to find alternative routes for their journeys.Diversions are in place are motorists are advised to seek an alternative route.Follow the latest in our traffic alerts below from @TrafficwatchNI, @BBCNITravel and @PSNITraffic.A Twitter List by BelTel  Most ReadPervert Davy Tweed at centre of alleged buried baby probe after wooden cross foundNI protocol crisis: Paul Givan’s resignation expected by afternoon and effective immediately amidst border crisis – of which Downing Street was unawareHalt to post-Brexit NI Protocol checks ‘matter for Executive’ as Brandon Lewis confirms UK won’t interveneMan found dead at lough was killed as associates didn’t trust him to stay silent, senior detective tells inquestChristine Frampton apologises for ‘insensitive’ tweet about politicians and suicideTop VideosPlayProtocol checks appear to continue in Northern IrelandPlaySinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd responds as Edwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsPlayEdwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsLatest Belfast‘Still no closure’ for family of Jenner Dornan six years on from her murder‘If elected, I’ll give £k of my annual wage to local community’, says Belfast businessmanRed-faced energy boss from Belfast who advised customers to cuddle pets to stay warmE-biker Frank Mitchell is lit-up about cycle to work challengeDire Straits’ love for Northern Ireland wasn’t dampened by terror alerts : ‘Belfast was brill... despite the bombs’LatestAshley Cole joins Frank Lampard’s coaching staff at EvertonJonny Gray starts as Scotland prepare to take on England in Six Nations openerMack Hansen to make his Ireland debut in their Six Nations opener against WalesKate joins Charles and Camilla for Docklands arts centre visitBoris Johnson backs down over Jimmy Savile claim aimed at Sir Keir Starmer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Executive Office NI FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJohn LarkinSam McBrideTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEdwin Poots acted to halt Irish Sea border checks after receiving legal advice from former Attorney General John Larkin, the Belfastunderstands.The development places the Executive in the remarkable situation where the current and former Attorneys General are in dispute and Mr Poots is acting on the advice of the former holder of that office.There has been widespread scepticism about why Mr Poots is moving now — three months before an election and after a threatened legal challenge from loyalist Jamie Bryson — to halt checks which he had previously allowed to proceed.But despite the politically suspicious timing of the DUP minister’s decision, the source of his legal advice points to this being a substantial legal dispute, rather than merely a political one.Mr Larkin, who specialised in constitutional law, was jointly appointed by the DUP and Sinn Féin to be the Executive’s chief legal adviser in  and was reappointed by both parties, holding the post for a decade. Prior to standing down in , he was made a temporary High Court judge and then ed to the bar.After his departure, the DUP and Sinn Féin could not agree on a replacement and so Brenda King was appointed interim Attorney General until June .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up On Wednesday afternoon Mr Poots received legal advice which he said was obtained from an unidentied QC. He said it told him that approval for the sanitary and phytosanitarychecks at ports had not been obtained from the Executive, that Executive approval was required and that “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval”. The DUP minister said the advice said that “I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval”.When Mr Poots previously sought to stop work on building border posts in September , Ms King’s legal advice to the Executive led Mr Poots into a rapid U-turn where he allowed the posts to be built.As reported by this newspaper on Saturday, Ms King’s firm advice at the time was that such action would be unlawful on multiple levels and civil servants would not have to follow an order to break the law. Although the situation now dfers from  in several respects, the core part of the dispute is essentially unchanged.On Friday the FDA, the union which represents senior civil servants, wrote to the head of the Civil Service, Jayne Brady, requesting that officials be given “clear unambiguous guidance in the event of ministers issuing reckless and potentially illegal instructions”.At issue are two conflicting interpretations of the legality of Irish Sea border checks. The DUP argues that in the absence of explicit Executive authorisation for the checks, they are unlawful because the Good Friday Agreement requires all signicant or controversial decisions to be cleared by the Executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBrenda King.

Speaking to RTE’s Morning Ireland programme, she said: It#s very unhelpful. We#re working tirelessly with the UK to find solutions.Ms McGuinness said she will speak with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic when they meet on Thursday.We#re working tirelessly to find solutions with the United Kingdom to specic problems and indeed have put forward very specic details, she said.I#m not sure what the purpose of this move is. Our clear position is that Northern Ireland is in a very unique and positive situation.Unfortunately, the news of this stopping of inspections,that#s what happens, is really, really unhelpful in us finding a way forward.The European Commission want to work through solutions and prevent unpredictability, Ms McGuinness added.It#s an absolute breach of international law. That is a major problem because we need to be able to trust each other.It#s very hard to know what the purpose of this is because it doesn#t help the businesses in Northern Ireland. The minister doing this overnight is ignoring the hard work, the tireless effort, that we are putting into finding those practical solutions for Northern Ireland, she said.The order to halt the checks has been criticised by Sinn Fein, who described it as a stunt. Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, of Sinn Fein, said the move was an attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law.Related topicsNI ProtocolMore On NI Protocol‘Northern Ireland business needs stability from protocol and political institutions’, says Danske boss Vicky Davies PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionPaul Givan’s resignation as First Minister will have far-reaching consequences on Stormont legislationNI protocol crisis: Paul Givan’s resignation expected by afternoon and effective immediately amidst border crisis – of which Downing Street was unawareWhat happens next  Your key questions answered after DUP minister orders Northern Ireland port checks to stop PremiumDUP#S Edwin Poots halting Northern Ireland port checks after legal advice from ex-Attorney General John LarkinMost ReadPervert Davy Tweed at centre of alleged buried baby probe after wooden cross foundNI protocol crisis: Paul Givan’s resignation expected by afternoon and effective immediately amidst border crisis – of which Downing Street was unawareHalt to post-Brexit NI Protocol checks ‘matter for Executive’ as Brandon Lewis confirms UK won’t interveneMan found dead at lough was killed as associates didn’t trust him to stay silent, senior detective tells inquestChristine Frampton apologises for ‘insensitive’ tweet about politicians and suicideTop VideosPlayProtocol checks appear to continue in Northern IrelandPlaySinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd responds as Edwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsPlayEdwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsLatest Northern IrelandJames Brokenshire’s widow speaks of love for NI in call for UK-wide lung cancer screeningYoungest first minister Paul Givan also expected to be shortest servingHauliers representative urges clarity over port checksResignation of First Minister is ‘gross betrayal’ of the people, claims SDLPInvest NI ‘fails miserably for Derry’, councillors claimLatestHow erse are this year’s Bafta film nominations James Brokenshire’s widow speaks of love for NI in call for UK-wide lung cancer screeningHomeowners struggling with rising mortgage costs urged to contact lendersGarda accused of leaking information on controversial golf society dinnerAshley Cole joins Frank Lampard’s coaching staff at Everton,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help.

Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday. His son, Neville, still has horses in training. The late Drew Reid also from Banbridge, rode many of Victorrsquos horses in point-to-points.A notable absentee at the entrance on Saturday was William McDowell, although he was present.

Focus is also given to what goes into building the sets, mapping the story, making the prosthetics, and generating CGI footage, and there’s plenty of interactive sections and photo ops.Visitors will easily become immersed on a tour that takes at least  minutes to savour.Although the show itself is known for its violent scenes, the good news for families is the tour is suitable for children aged five and up.Adult tickets cost £. and childrencost £.. Students, senior and family tickets are also available.Find out more at www.gameofthronesstudiotour——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Rev Kirpatrick related how he had actually been ready to retire this year but believed God directly guided him to take up the role of moderator.Pressed on declining church membership in a secular age, he said that he welcomed the process in that it reduced nominal membership and pressed those inside and outside the church to think carefully about their beliefs.He also related how Presbyterian membership in large parts of the Republic of Ireland is increasing. This he put down to “open” and “developing” churches adopting new formats to reduce barriers, community, a growing interest from people with “no faith”, a focus on hospitality and more emphasis on Jesus Christ as opposed to Presbyterianism.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe move was announced as the Conservative administration at Westminster prepared to publish its Levelling Up white paper.Prime minister Boris Johnson, who has come under fire as a result of the “partygate” allegations, will attempt to ert attention from the ongoing saga by insisting the “defining mission” of his government is to “level up” the country so people have “access to the same opportunities” regardless of where in the UK they live.Levelling up secretary Michael Gove is to invite Wales first minister Mark Drakeford, as well as his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon, and Paul Givan and Michelle O’Neill from Northern Ireland, to take part in the project, calling for the four nations to work together in the same way as they did in the Covid vaccine roll out.In addition, the Glasgow city region is to be one of three new Innovation Accelerator areas, and will receive a share of £ million of UK Government funding in a bid to encourage innovation and research and development work and boost local opportunities.Speaking ahead of the launch of the White Paper, the prime minister said: “From day one, the defining mission of this government has been to level up this country, to break the link between geography and destiny so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities.”He added: “The challenges we face have been embedded over generations and cannot be dug out overnight, but this White Paper is the next crucial step.“It is a vision for the future that will see public spending on RD increased in every part of the country, transport connectivity improving, faster broadband in every community, le expectancies rising, violent crime falling, schools improving and private sector investment being unleashed.”.removeThe prime minister declared: “It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK.”Mr Gove meanwhile described the UK as an “unparalleled success story with one of the world’s biggest and most dynamic economies”.However he stated: “Not everyone shares equally in the UK’s success. Great cities like Glasgow, Belfast, Swansea and Manchester, and proud towns from Aberystwyth to Armagh, to Bangor and Yeovil, have huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back.“Our ambitious plan to unite and level up the whole UK seeks to end that historic injustice and call time on the postcode lottery.”But he added: “We will only succeedall layers of government – UK, devolved, and local – work together.“We have seen through the success of the vaccine roll-out what we can achieve when we pull together.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPeople who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust NHS information, wear masks during the pandemic or follow the rules, Welsh research has found.Adverse childhood experiencesinclude neglect, mistreatmentand growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems.Parents separating or orcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of ACEs.The new study, published in the the open access journal BMJ Open, involved surveying , people aged  and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions .Experts looked at nine dferent ACEs as well as low trust in NHS Covid- information, whether people backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy .While  per cent of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, around one in five had suffered one type, around one in sixreported two to three, and one in reported four or more.The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid- information, to feel unfairly restricted by the Government and to support the end of mandatory face masks.The nine ACEs included in the study were: physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence and living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and or drug misuse, or a family member in prison.People were twice as likely to break Covid rulesthey had four or more ACEs compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four ACEs compared with none..removeMore than four ACEs were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing.Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at  per cent for those aged  to  with more than four ACEs, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccine. Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Unfortunately, this error was not noticed until later in the evening.“Once the capacity was reached, The Seagoe Hotel was unable to admit any further customers without breaking the law. We would like to publicly thank our door staff and events team who worked tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of all our guests and made the best of a very dficult situation. “We are devastated that this has happened. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused, and to make reparations Bingo Loco will offer, on top of a refund, complimentary entry into a future Bingo Loco of your choice @ The Seagoe Hotel. “We at The Seagoe Hotel will also provide each customer who were unable to gain access, a complimentary £ drinks voucher for a future Bingo Loco event. Bingo Loco will be in contact with customers that were affected. “Bingo Loco apologise for the IT error that led to this mistake and have made assurances this will never happen again. We hope to see you all again in the very near future and thank you for your patience and understanding.”CustomersPortadown  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCustomers go ‘Loco’ after IT ticket mix-up at bingo event le...NewsDelays expected as M reopens after incident near Moira...NewsPolice find ammunition in M vehicle check...NewsPerson caught red-handed dumping sofa in Portadown, as MP to...NewsPSNI alert after vehicles tampered with and money stolen in ...NewsMost PopularInk cartridges: how to save money on printer ink cartridge a...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...RecommendedValentine’s Day UK  flowers: roses, Lego, MS - best Feb...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Rev John KirkpatrickEach received the following votes:Rev John Kirkpatrick  votes: The Presbyteries of Ballymena, North Belfast, South Belfast, East Belfast, Dromore, Dublin  Munster, Iveagh, Omagh, Templepatrick and TyroneRev Dr Colin McClure  vote: The Presbytery of CarrickfergusRev Dr Trevor McCormick  votes: The Presbyteries of Coleraine  Limavady, Newry, and RouteRev Alastair McNeely  votes: The Presbyteries of Ards, Armagh, Derry  Donegal, Down, Monaghan.Having received the most votes from the Church’s  presbyteries, Mr Kirkpatrick will be the denomination’s th Moderator since  and its first from Portrush Presbyterian Church.Speaking about his election, the -year-old North Coast minister said, “I am genuinely surprised by what has happened, but very excited at the prospect of the story God is going to write from June and the months that follow. “As I continue to serve the Lord Jesus in this new role, I am looking forward to coming alongside our churches at this critical time, encouraging them as we move forward from Covid. I also look forward to building good relationships wherever possible, honouring Jesus and representing our Church across the island and further afield.”Born in in Limavady, Mr Kirkpatrick was brought up from the age of three in Ballymena. A third generation Presbyterian minister – his father had been minister of Balteagh Presbyterian, near Limavady, while his grandfather had also served in congregations in Counties Donegal, Tyrone and Antrim.Mr Kirkpatrick has been minister of Portrush Presbyterian for nearly  years, having served in the holiday town since . Prior to that, he spent nearly six years in Garryduff Presbyterian near Ballymoney, his first congregation. He was ordained in  as an assistant minister in Megain Memorial and Mersey Presbyterian Churches in East Belfast. When he became minister in Portrush, he also represented PCI in its partner relationships in Central and Eastern Europe until .Having attended Ballymena County Primary School and Coleraine Academical Institution, he went on to study farm management at Greenmount Agricultural College from -, with an agri career in mind. This led to three years of study at the University of Ulster’s, Coleraine campus, where in  he gained a BSc in Social Science and Environmental Studies. After spending a year working for the Department of Agriculture, in  he attended Belfast Bible College before starting his studies at Union Theological College for the ordained ministry of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the same year.Talking about his faith, Mr Kirkpatrick said: “With a father and a grandfather as Presbyterian ministers, you might say that I am not only ‘a son of the Manse’, but ‘a grandson of the Manse’ as well. While I came to a personal faith in Jesus at the age of nine, there was never an expectation that I would follow in their footsteps. But God, obviously, had other plans and I genuinely give thanks for the near  years I have spent in the ordained ministry.”Today he ministers to a congregation of around  families in and around the seaside town, which grows considerably during the summer months and at Easter. “I would describe myself as a ‘preaching pastor’, as I see the linked importance of preaching and teaching the Bible, coupled with pastoral care being the complimentary need to this.“The issues that we face at Portrush Presbyterian Church, or ‘PPC’, are set against the context of the st century, a secular society, but a hungry society. In my time in PPC we have reflected the wider cultural trends, which I am glad to say have been away from ‘nominalism’ and traditional church attendance, to a more committed church community living in a community where outwardly church is less important, but certainly not without value.“Primarily we love to share the Good News in all ways we can, but we know we must earn trust and respect. In this, we see the location of PPC as critical to a very wide community of visitors and friends, helped by street gospel distributions and other opportunities as cultural moments in the town provide s for evangelism. As Moderator, I want to translate the le and experience of ministry in Portrush, both church and community, to a bigger canvas, but with the same vision and pattern,” he said.Mr Kirkpatrick also explained that building relationships with the community, and serving the community, were both important. “We see our presence as a gospel one, building relationships with all where we can people and organisations are part of this involvement from our local schools, to the PPC’s shop in the town that connects with community in a dferent way and funds ious community projects. We also encourage our members to be active in the community in ious ways through the RNLI and REACH, for example, a community project which took on a greater signicance due to Covid.”With regards to the pandemic, he said that while the lockdown was dficult for so many dferent reasons, it also created an opportunity to try new things. “We did recorded services and streaming services. I did a daily devotional called ‘Side-by-Side’ and a video reading of several appropriate books such as ‘The hiding place’ by Corrie ten Boom, ‘To a dferent drum’ by Pauline Hamilton, and Elizabeth Kuhn’s, ‘Green leaf in drought’ as I wanted to encourage our people in their isolation.”Married to Joan for  years this summer, a palliative care nurse, they have four children and five grandchildren. “Thursday was baking day in our home during the lockdown when Joan baked. The following day I was able to deliver to folk as part of my rounds, giving me a chance to listen to them and pray for them on the doorstep, or in their garden. We’ve made every effort to be in church and have le back when we were given the chance. Thankfully we have a big building, which has meant we could welcome everyone back safely.”Thinking about his forthcoming year in office, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “For everyone, the last two years have seen all aspects of le, and Church le with it, turned upside down and the story still isn’t over yet. As time moves on, I hope and pray that we will be able to process the many painful memories that it has left behind. I appreciate that this will not be an easy, or a straightforward journey for everyone, as our stories are all dferent.“With this in mind, as Moderator, I look forward to visiting congregations, ministers and their families, seeing what they have been through, how they have coped, and ministering into that. Stepping into my predecessor’s shoes after two years will not be easy, and I pay tribute to Dr Bruce as he has led the Church through this time of national and global crisis. Whatever the year may hold, I am thankful to God, that I won’t be undertaking it alone, and certainly not in my own strength, for Jesus will be with me!”When Mr Kirkpatrick is not in the pulpit, or visiting members of his congregation, he says that he enjoys walking, reading, watching films and listening to an eclectic mix of music. His more active pursuits include a love of motorcycle sport, motocross and motorcycle racing. Since , he has been Race Chaplain to the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland. He also enjoys gardening and bee keeping.Mr Kirkpatrick will be officially nominated to this year’s General Assembly at its opening night in Belfast on  June when he will succeed the current Moderator, Rt Rev Dr David Bruce. Dr Bruce will continue in office as the PCI’s principal public representative until then.Presbyterian ChurchPortrushJesusIreland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCustomers go ‘Loco’ after IT ticket mix-up at bingo event le...NewsDelays expected as M reopens after incident near Moira...NewsPerson caught red-handed dumping sofa in Portadown, as MP to...NewsPolice find ammunition in M vehicle check...NewsPSNI alert after vehicles tampered with and money stolen in ...NewsMost PopularInk cartridges: how to save money on printer ink cartridge a...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...RecommendedValentine’s Day UK  flowers: roses, Lego, MS - best Feb...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The former DUP leader said he had taken legal advice which meant he could order the checks to stop without the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive. His party are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had been agreed by the EU and the UK in order to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. However, unionists, who believe the arrangements are damaging to Northern Ireland’s position within the UK, have been critical. Currently, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Irelands ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and should not continue without the Executive’s approval. Today, Mr Poots said legal advice he had received confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitarychecks required approval from the Stormont Executive. This meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and that at a result a formal instruction had been issued to DAERA’ss permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on December ,  as of midnight tonight.

It is understood that an announcement could be made at around .pm this afternoon . The move means that deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle ONeill, also loses her position as the two roles are a joint office shared between Stormont’s two biggest parties. Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments. However, as there would be no First or Deputy First Minister in place, no new decisions could take place. That would mean that the current COVID- restrictions, including the wearing of masks would remain in place for the forseeable. Similarly, an energy scheme which would see , people receive a pound grant would be thrown into jeopardy while a scheduled apology for victims of historical abuse would be in doubt. Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. The SDLP’s Upper Bann MLA, Dolores Kellysaid the DUP’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland”. “Whatever community you’re from, whatever your background or beliefs, no one benefits from this cynical, and totally predictable, electioneering stunt,” she said. She added that the DUPs MLAs need to explain to people in our community, people who are struggling to cope with rising energy bills and to put food on the table, those and their loved ones who are facing an eternity on hospital waiting lists, people who are struggling to access a decent education for their children, why the DUP has done this at a critical juncture for politics here. The truth is that for the DUP, the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, she said. “This DUP drama has been concocted by Jeffrey Donaldson as a last desperate attempt to resuscitate their flagging poll numbers ahead of an Assembly election in May. We’ve come to expect shameless stunts from the DUP but putting ordinary people in the firing line is unforgivable. “People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. That has been the cycle of the last fteen years and it has delivered nothing but failure. It is time to break that cycle and offer people a dferent choice.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efdccedeaac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adebdafbaedfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
