The Sea For Yourself campaign wants them to take pride of place on your plateFish and chips with a side order of mushy peas has been a Friday night tradition for generations. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded fish and chip shop in London in 1860 and dedicated takeaways have been serving customers ever since.Yet despite this heritage, if you choose battered cod, plaice or haddock to soak up your vinegar, it’s unlikely to have been fished from UK waters: the majority of the cod and haddock we buy is imported from the Barents Sea or around Norway or Iceland.According to the Sea For Yourself campaign, which is largely funded by Defra and aims to inspire the UK to eat seafood caught in UK waters, close to half of adults would buy more seafood if they knew it was caught locally. The good news is that if you’re keen to eat more seafood that’s been caught closer to home, there’s a wealth of alternatives to choose from.We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. The NHS recommends that we should all enjoy at least two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oil-rich variety.“Most of us are familiar with nutrition advice that encourages us to eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for optimal health, and it’s the same when it comes to seafood,” says Juliette Kellow, consultant nutritionist at Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to support the UK seafood industry and funded mainly by a levy on all first-hand purchases of seafood products in the UK, including imported seafood. “Many varieties of fish provide a range of B vitamins, which help fight fatigue for those of us always on the go.“Incorporating fish such as herring, coley or hake, and shellfish like crab and mussels into your diet is smart, as they provide a great source of protein and allow you to make the most of all the health benefits seafood offers.” When you’re trying to get more variety into your diet, it makes sense to try something new.Trying a wide variety of fish dishes instead of sticking to well-worn favourites supports UK fishermen, helps stocks stay sustainable and keeps your mealtimes creative – because of course, the real beauty of seafood is its endless versatility.Four in 10 of us claim we’d be more likely to cook seafood at home if we felt more confident using it in the kitchen, and whipping up a Friday night fish supper – whether you’re angling for a pile of battered monkfish bites, a plate of simply dressed devilled herrings or a steaming bowl of moules marinière – is a lot easier than you might think.If a fish and chip supper is non-negotiable on a Friday night, beer-battered dover sole is a delicious alternative to cod, while shellfish is a great choice if you’re bored with chicken and looking for an alternative source of low-fat protein.In warmer weather, go for fresh hake with seasonal asparagus and Jersey Royals, or a poached hake salade niçoise. For something a bit different, crab thermidor is surprisingly quick to make, while fish tacos made with coley goujons make the ideal bite for sharing in front of the TV. Fresh oysters on ice or spiced coconut mussels are perfect for impressing. When the weather cools down, there’s a wealth of winter warmers to choose, from roast hake with curried stew to smoked mackerel risotto.Plenty of seafood dishes are surprisingly quick to pull together. Monkfish and coconut curry takes about 15 minutes to prepare, while an Asian-spiced crab and noodle salad with black sesame seed dressing can be on the table in 10 minutes flat. Children love fish too, which is always a bonus when faced with picky eaters – coley goujons instead of fish fingers, or mackerel fishcakes made with mash are easy weekday crowd-pleasers.We all have a favourite fish, and when you’re seafood savvy it’s not hard to find an often-overlooked alternative to your usual choice – from soft, flaky flounder to firm, boldly flavoured sprats or rainbow trout.With so much choice, you may struggle to decide what to cook, but to make things a bit easier, Seafish has created a website so you can arrange for the best of UK seafood to be delivered to your door.

For this project she returned to her grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg to explore themes of memory, isolation and female identity across three generations of her familyThe images in this series address questions of claustrophobic spaces. They convey a sense of being locked down, however they were taken last year before the emergence of Covid-19. They were snapped inside my grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg, which for many years she has hardly left. As long as I can remember my grandmother’s world has conveyed a sense of being locked down. She leaves the flat once a week to get groceries and a TV guide from the shop directly below her apartment. In the winter she doesn’t leave the flat for three months because it’s too cold and windy outside, or too slippery.To keep entertained, Babushka cooks, washes dishes, mends clothes and watches TV. Under Russia’s coroanvirus lockdown measures she isn’t allowed to travel more than 200 metres from her apartment. This is something she has hardly done in the past 10 years, so her life is relatively unchanged.With the intention of exploring my Russian connections, I made two trips to the country in September and December 2019. In this small apartment I made portraits of my grandmother (Babushka), my mother (Svetlana) and myself, in various configurations. I also documented the daily routines and minutiae of my grandmother’s life – the furnishings, her food and pickles, her decor and the ubiquitous television screen that is her main connection to the outside world.The reality I’m depicting here for my grandmother has not changed much she has always lived in this way. Since my grandfather died 10 years ago, her life has become increasingly isolated. My grandmother took care of me for the first four years of my life so, for me, the apartment is like a time capsule. When I visit I am treated like I’m still a child and it doesn’t feel like much changes, though at times I have not returned for years. The routine and familiarity of life in this apartment can be both bleak and comforting and I set myself the challenge of building a visual narrative with photographs taken only within its confines. I saw this work was as the beginning of a long-term process of engagement with my family history and I hadn’t anticipated that a depiction of this claustrophobic isolation would be so pertinent to what’s happening today.My grandmother was born at the start of the second world war, which brought starvation and many other privations. She experienced temporary blindness as a child and has permanent partial deafness as a result of the war. My mother grew up in communist Russia, when travel outside of the Soviet Union was not possible. As a young woman she lived through perestroika and also experienced immense hardship there was no food on the shelves and basic items were rationed. During this time there was also a lot of fear surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.My grandmother sewing in her bedroom, one of the common places you may find her in her flat at midday.The traumas of state violence, war and gender violence weigh heavily on my family. My great grandfather, a victim of Stalin’s purges, was executed in the 1930s. I was born in Russia, but came to Britain at the age of four, after my mother fled my abusive and violent father.With this project I wanted to engage with my family history and investigate my grandmother’s life and the relationships between her, my mother and me. I felt that through exploring this one small confined space I could find something typically Russian but universally human. I am particularly interested in the idea of post-memory, and in understanding the ways family trauma may be passed down through the generations. I am also interested in how we create and project on to our own pasts.My intention is to place female narratives, so often neglected, at the centre of this project. I hope this depiction of the lives of three ordinary women will represent something universal about the bonds of love and history that connect generations of women around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a63efc3f94fc3ec458a9f3693582d9aa97cf1026/184_1614_2629_1578/master/2629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d938c8182c2995f6c702c9e6a4ffb0b0","title":"lubaina himid you say the magic words black lives matter buy an exclusive print","story":" Print Shop is offering readers the chance to buy an exclusive print, created for the paper by Turner prize-winning artist Lubaina Himid as the cover of a special issue on racism in the UK, that ran in the G2 section.

The global lockdown has given birth to new cliches: wildlife cautiously exploring unpeopled streets iconic monuments devoid of tourists, save for the occasional solitary inidual escaping their confinement.This commission asked photographers to move beyond the obvious and present a series of images that respond to the issues confronting us, to begin to plot a route to a new future and to new ways of thinking about the world.June 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of my move to Istanbul. In my hectic global life, I have finally been grounded in my favourite city. The past few months have given me a chance to explore Istanbul more intimately than in all my years of living here. I set out to portray the city in crisis and confinement, but what I found was a erse social fabric where pockets of hope and human resilience prevail.As a tribute to the multiple layers of Istanbul’s unique cultural identity, I have collected stories from “non-essential workers”, whose lives have been derailed by the pandemic. As they spoke to me, they related not just their fears, but also their hopes about the future and ways of trying to adapt to a new reality. From street vendors to magicians, barbers to dancers, hammam scrubbers to imams, each expressed dignity in the face of hardship and a unique way of resisting and overcoming their daily stresses. In his memoire Istanbul: Memories and the City, Orhan Pamuk wrote: “If I see my city as beautiful and bewitching, then my life must be so too.” As I explored the various parts of this vast megalopolis and connected with its inhabitants in their own microcosms, their moods and feelings imprinted on mine. In this process, I began to embrace the city as my own in a way that I haven’t done before.I meet the illusionist on board Le Vapeur Magique, an 1828 steamship, where he performed for tourist parties and corporate dinners before the pandemic. On the lower deck we enter a small theatre with a stage framed by the black velvet curtain. Empty chairs stand in semi-circles, the lights are dim. Özgür, in a magician’s dark brown frock coat with a white frilly collar, shows me his card tricks first. He waves a hand and the top card changes suit. He picks up a small table by the tablecloth and it flies, he pulls out a wallet and sets it on fire.“My first audience was my family.” Özgür taught himself magic when he was six years old by watching other magicians on TV. “I am a freelancer. If the phone rings I work, if it does not, I don’t work. I was scared of the pandemic, of the impact.” Since Covid-19 paralysed his professional life, Özgür has shifted focus to broadcasting his magic on YouTube. He spent a few days designing a set for an online performance, uploaded the promo, and two days later received a phone call from a woman who booked him to perform at her son’s birthday party via Zoom. This was Özgür’s first gig in two months of quarantine.A techno track plays continuously in a cosy ground-floor apartment in Cihangir where two honey-bear cats – Roket and Tatar – saunter, shedding their luxurious fur. On top of a wooden shelf filled with LPs stands a new mixer, which Yunan bought when the Covid-19 crisis led to the cancellation of all her gigs. Yunan recalls her last gig on 14 March . “It was in this tiny cosy restaurant and pre-club space, Markus Tavern. I play long sets there regularly, anything that inspires me. As I walked there, I was questioning everything. Like why am I going to DJ in the middle of the pandemic? Is it going to be my last gig for who knows how long? Everything had started already, the flights were cancelled two to three days later. But still it was a lovely night with beautiful people and great vibes.” Now in her mid-30s, Yunan is comfortable with solitude. Social distancing has not changed much of her daily routine, but she misses the performance. “Being in a DJ booth for me is like meditation. I don’t think about anything else. Even when I am super nervous or excited, it just goes away. When people don’t dance, it makes me feel like I am stuck in a little can, the shape is cylindrical, so in order to get out, I play the invincible track. A secret weapon that will get the crowd going.” Yunan dismisses the thought of never working as a DJ again. “It’s not possible. Music has always been there and people will need their rituals.”“I buy objects because I like them. I enjoy my solitude and I don’t need to fill any void by buying stuff.” Nevzad’s store is layer upon layer of objects he has collected in his last 10 years as an antiques dealer. On most afternoons, Nevzad, a reticent man in his 50s, chain-smokes in an armchair at the back of his store where he is barely visible behind a labyrinth of shelves. A well dressed couple walk inside the store and with a haughty air inquire after a wooden chest. “It’s not for sale,” Nevzad answers cooly. They eye a few other items and leave the store. “If I believe in the customer, I sell them things. I bring down the price or even give it away. I am like a grumpy old bookseller who would only sell to someone worthy of adopting his orphaned books.” Nevzad buys objects with a mindset of a collector, following a chosen theme of “tradable” ideas. “Objects can tell history. For example, I am now collecting things about the intelligence service and I would like to find a photograph of Mata Hari. I know she stayed in Istanbul at Pera Palace. I would love to get a photo of the world’s greatest spy when she was here.” Nevzad shrugs when I ask him which objects he would collect to tell the story of the current pandemic. “Maybe I will collect masks. But it’s not interesting to me right now, because we are in the middle of it. We are living through it. Maybe in 20 years I will have a better perspective.”Nevzad takes us around the corner to a spacious three-tier studio warehouse filled with a dizzying amount of objects he has bought in bulk and now rents out as props and set designs for cinema. I feel as though I walked into a parallel universe of Istanbul, each section representing a slice of life gone forever.. Nevzad’s slender frame in the dim light of the studio is dwarfed by the volume of his collection. I can’t help wonder if he feels the ephemeral weight of memories attached to each object. Do they whisper to him, I ask. Nevzad smiles: “It doesn’t bother me. I’ve been enjoying the quiet days of the quarantine. I am happy to be away from the people.”“I prefer to be addressed as ‘they’.” Ceytengri opens the door wearing silver eyeshadow in the shape of dragon wings and glossy black lipstick in bold contour. This elaborate makeup session took them three hours of perfecting. In a living room shrouded in afternoon sun, they are having trouble slipping into a narrow silky Chinoiserie tube dress, which has a stubborn side zipper. The curtains, velvety and heavy like in a theatre, match the dress – burgundy red. The room’s furniture is a brighter tone of crimson red. Ceytengri sits down to touch up the eye lines at a vanity table with scattered makeup. They pull on a tall black boot – “Oh, I really miss wearing heels!” – they say.Ceytengri lip-synchs to mostly western music, but their performance is often riddled with social commentary. “For me it’s not just going on stage and doing a dance routine. It has to tell a story. For example I wear niqabs a lot during my shows. My grandma used to scare me as a kid not to approach women in niqabs because they will get me under their folds and steal me away. Niqabi women have been oppressed for a long time here in Turkey. But today Islamists are heading the state, so they are celebrated more than ever. So I like poking fun at them. I believe women should be able to wear what they want. Drag is about playing with the boundaries of reality and acknowledging that everyone has a different view of the world around them.Hazal, Gullu and Binnaz, informal garbage recyclersSerkan, a municipal garbage collector apologises for the smell of his uniform when he meets us in Yeni Çamlica, a small Roma community of informal recyclers in the Anatolian suburbs of Istanbul. He jumps off his garbage truck and walks home to put on a change of clothes. As we wait for him to return, a local municipality van pulls over and people in orange uniforms unload metal tiffin containers with hot food ready for distribution. Serkan leads us down the street lined with small homes. He introduces us to a teenage girl, Hazal, her mother, Gullu, and Binnaz, Gullu’s mother-in-law.Binnaz and Gullu have been collecting garbage for decades, but in the past month of quarantine, the buyers have closed down the shops, so the unsold trash has accumulated. Stacks of cardboard, plastic and paper lay idle on the hood of a weathered green pickup truck parked at the entrance to their home. “This is from the 20 days of trash collection. My husband is dead. My son is in jail for a crime he did not commit. So we do all the work ourselves,” says Binnaz. “Because of the curfew, it’s forbidden for us to collect garbage, but we still did it. We have too many children and grandchildren to feed.” A man approaches the group carrying plastic bags full of groceries: cartons of milk and juice, flour, oil and bread, which he passes to the women. “We survive with these handouts. Municipality helps too.” On a good month before the pandemic, Binnaz would earn about 1,000 Turkish lira (£116) collecting and reselling paper, metal and plastic. “It’s so boring to stay at home. We miss our freedom. We want to work and be out on the streets.” “My family has lived here for more than 40 years,” says Özgür, pointing to a small street with a web of laundry lines connecting buildings, just off the well-known Tarlabaşi boulevard. Tarlabaşi has succumbed to the growing pains of a drawn-out gentrification project. “My ancestors lived here. I was born and grew up here. We are losing something, like a neighbourhood, a family bond, seeing it gone makes me upset.” For the past two months of the pandemic, Özgür mostly stayed at home. A father of two, he was able to support his family with balloon sales in the past, but as part of government lockdown measures, people under 20, Özgür’s main client base, were ordered to stay indoors. “When I sell my balloons now I ask the customers to disinfect them before they give it to the child. I warn them because the virus is so tiny it can be anywhere.” Dressed in jeans and a hoodie, Reyhan picks us up from a busy square in Istanbul’s densely populated Gaziosmanpaşa district. Reyhan leads us to a quieter part of the neighbourhood, to her daughter’s home in a cottage where Reyhan moved during the quarantine.\u0026nbspA baby sleeps in a crib in the back room, while in the front room the daughter’s framed wedding photograph in a pink puffy dress is the centrepiece on the wall above the couch. Reyhan changes into her traditional Roma skirt and flower bezel, an attire she usually wears while teaching dance. The transformation is striking, not just her body and posture, but her face, too, becomes radiant.A dance instructor for more than two decades, Reyhan still remembers her first student – Elizabeth, an American oriental dancer who came to Turkey to study Roma dance. “She came to my home everyday. We both cried when she went back to America. But she told all her dancer friends about me. She said she found the most amazing Roma dancer in Turkey. That’s how the word spread. Back then there was no social media. Just from ear to ear.”\u0026nbspA vast majority of Reyhan’s students are foreign women who visit Turkey for a few weeks to study dance with her.She often gives lessons in her own home, but since the pandemic hit, Reyhan could not bear the thought of staying alone and moved in with her daughter’s family. She is sceptical about online classes she does not own a laptop and the phone screen is too small to demonstrate the dance moves. The pandemic has so far paralysed her professional life. “Social distancing is hard to keep while teaching dance. When I teach, I have to fix their body poses. Sometimes I see she has a problem, can’t do a move, so I hold her hand. She gets my energy and she understands the move. I let her hold my belly to understand how I move it, so she can see the difference. How can I do it through the screen? I can’t put the camera on my belly!”Behzad Şahin, owner of Cibalikapi meyhaneBehzad comes to his restaurant to check on Cimbiz the cat several times a week. . “We left him in charge here,” jokes Behzad as he surveys the empty room with chairs placed upside down on tables. His traditional Turkish meyhane – Cibalikapi – overlooks the Golden Horn and is known for its erse menu of mezes. The walls on the top floor are adorned with maps of old Istanbul and whimsical drawings of cats. He launched the original Cibalikapi meyhane in Balat 20 years ago, attributing the choice of location to its historic origins. “In Ottoman and Byzantine eras this was an important cosmopolitan port. Greeks, Armenians, Jews lived here and ran businesses. The meyhane back then were small seaside tavernas serving only wine to passing sailors, a patriarchal space. The role of women was solely to serve and entertain. Since the formation of the Turkish Republic, women began to join men  on more equal terms. This was when meyhane started evolving from a bar to an eatery.”Hülya Aslan’s tastefully furnished apartment in Bomonti looks over a noisy highway. Hülya enters the living room wearing a pistachio-coloured blazer with rolled-up sleeves over a white T-shirt. Her headscarf is tied around her neck in an elegant vintage style, resembling Audrey Hepburn’s. Hülya’s cousin is in the room with us, observing the shoot. When Hülya sits on the couch to pose, her trouser leg lifts up. “Pull it down, please,” her cousin intervenes, “You don’t want to be lynched again on social media for showing too much ankle.” With more than half a million followers on Instagram, Hülya has been a trendsetter in modest fashion since she first appeared on the pages of Ala, a conservative fashion magazine known in Turkey as the Vogue for the veiled. She later became its editor. “Ten years ago, there were very few fashion choices for them. They would wear short-sleeved shirts over long-sleeved shirts or trousers under skirts and dresses. No fashion labels produced clothes for them. So I thought, wait, we can do something, produce longer blazers, make the pants looser, headscarves should match the outfits, clothes should be made of natural materials with soft textures, because conservative women or veiled women have the right to be comfortable too.” • Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience.

Carter, wealthy and well connected, has just been sent down from Oxford. Their fellow conscripts are being posted to South Korea, Cyprus, Ireland, Sudan, but after Drum saves Carter from being fleeced in a card game, Carter returns the favour and secures them both cushy jobs in the Catering Corps.It is Carter, too, who fixes their transfer to a civil defence base in Cumbria in the final months of their service. Nicknamed Doom Town, the base is a training ground for a new kind of war, a painstakingly simulated facsimile of a town after an atomic strike. While the other men seem unaffected by playing war on this “two-square-mile playground”, the place grips Drum and Carter with a deep and sickening terror.It also marks the beginning of a bond that will define their lives. Theirs is a complicated and frequently unsatisfactory friendship. From the beginning there are failures, small but deep betrayals. Carter humiliates Drum. Drum steps in too late to keep Carter from being beaten up. But an understanding grows between them all the same, that they will stick together. A decade later, and owing at least as much to Carter’s self-interest as his decency, Drum swaps the Dagenham picket line for a dairy farm and becomes Carter’s neighbour. Their lives and the lives of their families entwine.A 544-page doorstopper, The Blind Light has been trumpeted by Evers’s publishers as a state-of-the-nation novel. Its range is certainly ambitious, a 60-year  from the Cuban missile crisis to 911 and the present-day war on terror, but rather than an overarching sweep, the author has distilled his narrative into a series of distinct vignettes years apart, each one set over a few days. His focus is close, even deliberately claustrophobic.Evers is excellent on the fine grain of friendship. He carefully unpicks the complex and often uncomfortable relationship between Drum and Carter: Carter’s arrogance and wilful self-delusion Drum’s paralysing fear of the future and his equally disabling fear of seeming weak. At one of many drunken dinners Carter tells Drum he has been asked to write about their national service experience. Drum objects: he doesn’t want Carter writing about him “like I was your batman or something”. Carter protests – he would never do that. “You wouldn’t know you were doing it,” Drum replies flatly.The book is full of these delicately judged moments, simultaneously inconsequential and profound. Whereas the relationships between the men’s children feel more generic, Evers finds affecting depth in the more cautious, but in the end much truer, attachment between their wives.He is less certain of his ground when it comes to plot. The different sections of the novel have an immersive granularity that allows them to unfold almost in real time but the structure by which he connects them across six decades is clumsy and, on occasion, melodramatic. While The Blind Light is meticulously embedded in historical detail, the (invented) seismic event that forms the fulcrum of the narrative stretches credulity, undermining the authenticity of the undertaking.Evers’s periodically overworked prose is also a distraction. He can and frequently does write with a lovely lucidity, even lyricism, but too often he adopts an irritatingly mannered style. He has a habit of chopping his sentences. Into snatches. Snatches repeated for emphasis. Yes, emphasis. The intention is presumably to create emotional immediacy but over 500 pages it grates, disrupting rather than intensifying the reader’s connection with his characters.There is still much to savour in The Blind Light. At its heart, the novel is a thoughtful and powerful study of the corrosive effects of fear, the damage we do to ourselves and our loved ones when danger is all we can see.

With Waterstones and some indie shops set to open on 15 June, Alison Flood finds out what the plan isMelissa Davies had planned to fulfil a lifelong dream and open her independent bookshop, Pigeon Books, in Southsea, at the beginning of April. Those plans were put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic, but with a relaxation of lockdown rules from next week, bookshops will be able to open to customers – for the first time in over two months. Davies and her husband are now preparing for a very different sort of opening. “We had to quickly rethink our entire business plan and how we could operate, and now we’re gearing up to open our doors for the first time under really different circumstances,” she says. The tiny Pigeon Books will ask its browsing customers to use hand sanitiser, or wear gloves, before and after touching books, and will restrict the number of customers in the shop to two at a time.“We’re excited about opening but also worried about how we’re going to make it work and how we can keep ourselves and our customers safe,” Davies says. She continues to work full time in customer service, and to write (her first poetry collection, Pineapples in the Pool, was published by Unbound in 2018). “We’ll be opening with reduced hours for a few weeks to see how things go. We’re so nervous about it though. Who opens a bookshop in a pandemic?”Daunt feels that compared to the challenges some other retailers face, bookshops are “actually the very easiest end of it”. “There aren’t many retailers who can close their doors abruptly and open them up three months later and everything’s in perfect shape. We don’t have winter fashions on racks when it’s now boiling hot.” Waterstones was forced to close its stores in March after some staff complained they felt at risk. Daunt said the “vast majority” had said “they’re very keen to come back, but not all … some feel more concerned about it, so it’ll be down to iniduals”.At the Booksellers Association, a survey of membership found that nearly a third of independent bookshops were planning to open fully once restrictions were lifted. “Initially we were assuming that everyone would jump in, but there is quite a variety of opinion,” according to Meryl Halls, the managing director. “Some shops are desperate to get back for a variety of reasons, some of that commercial and some of it community-based and some are very cautious – they are worried about staff, family members, or might be shielding themselves.”At the Beckenham Bookshop, in Bromley, Kelly Bradford is trying to make her store “a pleasant and enriching experience again”, with hand-drawn signs, colourful safety markings, sanitiser and even a velvet rope “for that VIP experience”. “I am anxious about the public response to us reopening, but I am hopeful, if we can provide a calming environment, then it may help people to find their groove,” she says. “The future is unknown, and it is scary out there, but I am confident that if anyone can pull off a new way to enjoy shopping it is booksellers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae6e7ff4d0d003889c73f5c89bedf73c859c753/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43747c6fa0d37620cdb07b7b1f19249","title":"are you returning to work in a non essential shop in england","story":"We would like to hear from those who will be going back to work in retail shops that have been closed during lockdownAll non-essential shops in England will be able to reopen on Monday as announced by the business secretary, Alok Sharma.

The Department for Transport guidance “strongly” encourages passengers to check in bags and minimise hand luggage because it will “speed up boarding and disembarking and minimise the risk of transmission”.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the guidelines were “a positive next step” for the embattled aviation sector to start recovery, after most flights were grounded due to coronavirus and travel restrictions from late March.Shapps added: “The government’s advice currently remains to avoid all non-essential travel, but today we are taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back\u0026nbspwhen it is safe for restrictions on travel to be lifted.”The guidelines for air travel come as more flights are due to resume next week, when easyJet will restart domestic services from Gatwick.The advice, which broadly follows the guidance from the UN aviation body the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as well as input from the UK aviation industry, also recommends checking in online and remaining seated as much as possible during the flight.General health advice will continue to apply, such as attempting to maintain social distancing where possible in the airport, and washing hands regularly after touching any surfaces, including check-in kiosks and trolleys.Passengers are urged to bring their own face covering for use throughout their journey including at the airport, with spare coverings for longer journeys and plastic bags to store used masks.Specific rules on temperature checks or self-certification, which some airlines and airports have asked for, have not been issued. But in line with general guidance passengers have been told not to travel if they have been in close contact with anyone with symptoms in the past 14 days.Tim Hawkins, chief strategy officer at MAG, the owner of Stansted and Manchester airports, said they had collaborated with the government to draw up the guidelines, based on advice from independent medical and scientific experts who looked at necessary safety measures at each stage of travel.But Ryanair said that it recommended hand luggage, which would only be touched by the passenger, rather than checked-in bags which would have contact with multiple baggage handlers and check-in staff.Apart from Ryanair, most airlines and airports welcomed the guidelines, which they said would help pave the way for travel to resume – but also urged the government to remove the impediment of its controversial\u0026nbspquarantine rules\u0026nbspand introduce proposed “air bridges” to enable flights to selected international destinations as soon as possible.Tim Alderslade, chief executive of\u0026nbspAirlines\u0026nbspUK, said the guidelines were welcome: “They\u0026nbspdemonstrate how\u0026nbspairlines\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspapply targeted and multi-layered measures to ensure air travel is safe for customers and crew.”The International Air Transport Association said the measures were sensible but “rendered useless if the government continues with the 14-day quarantine rule”.A Ryanair spokesperson said the government should “stop issuing rubbish advice to passengers about baggage and instead focus their efforts on scrapping the UK’s useless visitor quarantine, which the UK Home Office now admit cannot be implemented, supervised or policed effectively”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf12c5a9ee71fe425fef844dee6e078fc3cede5f/0_74_5705_3427/master/5705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b806331d8de3bf26e7ba2ccc419f824","title":"the guardian view on the cabinet a paucity of talent","story":"Government in Britain relies on a critical mass of serious secretaries of state. The current crop is worryingly lightweight The supreme executive body in British politics is the cabinet, chaired by the prime minister. That is the constitutional theory, but in the public imagination the system is seen as rather more presidential.Over time, prime ministers have become increasingly dominant. Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher had their “kitchen cabinets.” Tony Blair was criticised for operating an informal “sofa government”. In the period of coalition government after 2010, David Cameron stitched up deals in a four-man “quad”. But under Boris Johnson, the aggregation of power in Downing Street is unprecedented. It resembles a campaign more than an administration.That is not surprising given the prominence inside No 10 of figures from the Vote Leave referendum team, headed by Dominic Cummings. That faction is obsessed with information warfare and is disrespectful of Whitehall, seeing departmental structures as relics of a dysfunctional system. Cabinet ministers appear often to be mere spokespeople, subservient to Downing Street advisers who write their scripts.It takes a certain calibre of politician to resist that process. When Rishi Sunak was appointed chancellor, few expected him to stand out from Mr Johnson’s shadow. He is young, relatively inexperienced and the job came with the condition that Treasury advisers answer to No 10. But Mr Sunak has been a steady and articulate manager of the economic response to the pandemic. The hardest part – navigating a recession – is yet to come, but he invites more confidence than most of his colleagues.Another relatively independent figure is Matt Hancock, who has demonstrated some organisational grip on his department. There is plenty to criticise about the health secretary’s handling of the pandemic – equipment shortages, misused statistics, neglect of care homes – but it is hard to imagine anyone else in the cabinet doing a better job. Dominic Raab is a weak foreign secretary whose unfitness for a top job was widely displayed as he garbled inanely through a stint as stand-in, when the prime minister was ill with Covid-19. Priti Patel has brought authoritarian paranoia and bullying incompetence to a Home Office that was over-endowed with those traits already.Other departments are no more blessed. Gavin Williamson has been uninspiring in a crucial role. The education secretary has had months to devise a strategy for reopening schools but has not progressed beyond picking needless fights with unions. Even those who resent Michael Gove for the work he did as education secretary in the coalition years recognise an effective operator who directed his department towards policy implementation. Now Mr Gove brings a veteran’s heft to the cabinet office, averting an even worse shambles at the heart of government.The daily coronavirus briefing press conferences have been a showcase of absent talent. The public cannot have been impressed with the performances of Robert Jenrick, Alok Sharma and Grant Shapps. These figures have been shrunk by the size of the crisis.It is easy to be beguiled by nostalgia. There was no golden age of all-heavyweight cabinets. Some roles are by their nature reserved for less showy politicians, just as some jobs have been doled out as bribes to troublemaking rivals with no talent except for making mischief. But the chaff used to be leavened with intelligence and capability. The balance has shifted under Mr Johnson. Advancement under his reign has been dependent on a stupefying degree of loyalty to the personality cult of “Boris” and the doctrine of an ultra-hard Brexit. Independent thought and moderating pragmatism are mostly banished to the back benches.That dynamic leaves no mystery as to why the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is marked by indecision, inconsistency and lethal incompetence. An administration that values propaganda over governance and ideological purity over honesty is uniquely ill-suited to a public health emergency. The prime minister is the most prominent face of that failure, but his weakness is further exposed by the flimsy cabinet. Behind the coronavirus crisis is a crisis of government, made all the more serious by a conspicuous shortage of ministers who have shown that they deserve to be taken seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aab64174d8d7869dab7c7e84dd3a68ee38155c28/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=941844682a621b6db90fd7b3b8ccd8a7","title":"oxford black professors cecil rhodes british empire","story":"The city is strewn with tributes to the great of the British empire. The devastation they wreaked is routinely forgottenThe toppling of Edward Colston certainly made for a dramatic scene. The frantic energy of large crowds cheering while the statue plunged into the river in Bristol signalled the release of pent-up tension accumulated during a pandemic and widespread anti-racism protests.Within 48 hours, Oxford was seized by the same zeal. More than 1,000 people gathered on the city’s high street to call for the removal of the statue commemorating the notorious Victorian imperialist Cecil John Rhodes. It was a coordinated, peaceful and impassioned protest about the statue and about structural racism in Britain.\u0026nbspWhen it was my turn to address the crowd, I introduced myself as one of about seven black professors (official statistics are not available) at the University of Oxford, to simultaneous cheer and shock. I proceeded to say that I am an angry black man, fully aware of the ugly stereotype that accompanies this image – hot-blooded, impervious to reason and unworthy of serious engagement – particularly when talking about matters of racial injustice.But how could I not be angry? Like many other black people in the UK and around the world, I witnessed the brutal torture and murder of George Floyd with outrage and revulsion. Outrage and revulsion at the long legacy of structural and institutional racism that has killed, exploited, subjugated and silenced so many black people in the United States, in Britain and in former white-settler colonies.It is this same outrage at institutional racism that ignited the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF) campaign in South Africa in early 2015. That protest rapidly became transnational, announcing itself in Oxford by asking uncomfortable questions about my university’s past. A former imperial training ground, Oxford is strewn with tributes to the great men of the British empire, who have portraits, busts, engravings, statues and even buildings dedicated to their memory. In contrast, the histories of conquest, famine and dispossession that these men left in their wake are routinely forgotten. RMF drew attention to this iconography as part of a varied agenda that included two additional aims: reforming the Eurocentric curriculums that dominate the university’s teaching and addressing the underrepresentation and inadequate welfare provision for black and minority-ethnic staff and students at Oxford. However, it did not take long before all focused on the removal of the Rhodes statue at Oriel College.\u0026nbspI was a PhD student in Oxford at that time as well as a founding member of our chapter of RMF. As a Zimbabwean, it was difficult for me to view Rhodes simply as a man with odious views compared with our contemporary standards, as if it were his words alone and not his actions that were under scrutiny. Rhodes’ statue, then, is no mere physical artefact. It is imbued with a noxious history. Its presence at Oriel College reframes Rhodes’ conquest as munificence to the university and fails to recognise the exploitation of African labour from which his estate was built. It belongs in a museum, where it can be properly historicised. More importantly, in 2015 and now, the calls for the removal of such statues open up discussions about how we talk about the dynamics of race and racism, inclusion and exclusion, and being and belonging in Britain.\u0026nbspInitial responses to RMF were hostile, infantilising and casually racist. The Conservative politician and Oriel College alumnus Daniel Hannan disparaged RMF as “cretinous”, dismissed its demands as “facile”, and said that students in the movement were “too dim” to be at university. Disappointingly, the otherwise astute and justly celebrated Cambridge professor, Mary Beard, argued that RMF is “a dangerous attempt to erase the past” and suggested that minority students should be empowered to look at the statue “with a cheery and self-confident sense of un-batterability”. Will Hutton, the principal of Hertford College at Oxford, reminded RMF students that were it not for the legacies of the British empire, South Africa would descend into “unaccountable despotism” as embodied by then president, Jacob Zuma. Revealingly, apart from a tokenistic nod to Nelson Mandela, Hutton made no acknowledgment of Africans shaping their own political destiny, and seemingly held no conception of Africans as historical agents. As for the upper echelons of Oxford University’s leadership, the chancellor Lord Patten said that students unable to embrace Rhodes “should think about being educated elsewhere”.\u0026nbspBehind the spectacle of toppling a statue, RMF gained significant traction in the university’s student and faculty body, owing to the hard, behind-the-scenes work of a great many student activists. It is a bitter irony then that, for all the exaltation of peaceful protest and deliberative democracy, Oriel College refused to remove the statue as it risked losing £100m in donor gifts from wealthy alumni.Four years later, we have an opportunity to engage in a more mature and honest conversation about race in Britain. The removal of the Rhodes statue would be a powerful gesture of public accountability and it would allow a good-faith discussion about institutional racism in my university as a small part of much broader demands for racial justice and equality in British society. Numerous writers – the likes of Reni Eddo-Lodge, Afua Hirsch, Akala, Emma Dabiri, David Olusoga and Kehinde Andrews – have already done much hard work in articulating and contextualising the black experience in Britain. Anti-racist activists are channelling years of anger and pain into coordinated protests about Britain’s past and present. When the righteous fury and indignation over the present moment begins to simmer down, the messy work of challenging racism in all its structural, institutional and interpersonal guises must continue. But, this time, it will have a greater critical mass.\u0026nbsp• Simukai Chigudu is associate professor of African politics at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccf4bb87e4704a301edd54f7f9a16359a48a3e44/0_137_5466_3280/master/5466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d465c663596c10398668de51b0b89114","title":"tory party waitrose conservatives lidl us trade deal","story":"In the battle over how to frame a US trade deal, MPs from true blue shires are pitted against red-wallers keen to reduce pricesThere’s a new ide in the Conservative party: Waitrose or Lidl? But it’s not about which supermarket you shop at. It’s how you view a potential trade deal with the US.As talks get under way across the pond, the cabinet is split between those who wish to prioritise British farmers and those who want their constituents to benefit from cheaper produce on the supermarket shelf.This isn’t a rehash of remain v leave. Instead it’s about which part of the Tory voter coalition gets priority treatment: traditionally Tory rural constituencies or the post-industrial, “red wall” seats that the party won for the first time last December.A trade deal with the US has long been cited by Tory Brexiteers as the jewel in the crown of their plans for post-Brexit Britain. The idea is that such an arrangement with Washington would remove the UK from Brussels’ regulatory orbit and show that the UK can negotiate its own trade deals even with the world’s largest economies.But despite the Conservatives now having a majority of 80, senior Tories are beginning to worry that their free market dream is on life support. As the prime minister grapples with the government response to coronavirus, a battle of ideas is playing out among ministers and MPs – and to the surprise of the free marketeers, it’s the protectionists who are on the front foot.This month Boris Johnson agreed a proposal for the trade deal that would see a “dual tariff” system in place that could allow ministers to use high tariffs to make it economically unsustainable for US producers to supply the UK with controversial foodstuffs such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef.“We’re in real danger of a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do a trade agreement with the United States being hijacked by a bunch of Waitrose protectionists,” says a senior Tory.\u0026nbspThe Waitrose set, as they have been dubbed, are made up of the likes of the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, environment secretary George Eustice, his predecessor Theresa Villiers and green Brexiteers such as Zac Goldsmith and Danny Kruger.Boosted from the sidelines by rural and organic champions such as Henry Dimbleby, this group wants British farmers and UK food standards to remain protected.\u0026nbspTheir concern is that farmers must not be undercut by cheaper production and lower animal welfare standards.Those familiar with Truss’s thinking insist she does not favour chlorinated chicken, but does view free trade as a way to increase consumer choice. The growing concern among this group – the Lidl free marketeers – is that chlorinated chicken is being used to shut down any debate on wider imports from the US.Several of the usual suspects who would be looked at to make the case have been missing in action of late, their attention focused either on China or the need for the lockdown to be eased. So it’s the new intake of red wall MPs who are agitating that protectionism could deprive their voters of a tangible benefit of Brexit: cheaper food on the supermarket shelf.“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that a lot of the MPs hijacking the debate represent wealthier constituencies with middle-class neighbourhoods,” says one. “They might appreciate organic produce but our new voters want decent stuff on the shelf and they also want choice.”This split between the agricultural interests and free trade goes back a long way, of course. In 1846, Robert Peel repealed the corn laws to provide cheap food for people in the new manufacturing centres. But that decision led to his resignation and a schism that kept the Tories out of power for the best part of 30 years.Coronavirus and the new importance placed on supply chain security\u0026nbspmeans the argument for free trade – that many Brexiteers believed they had won in the EU referendum, Tory leadership contest and general election – is becoming harder to make. As Johnson’s government becomes more interventionist and looks to make Britain more self-sufficient, arguments for free trade will have to be made again.Johnson’s final decision on the deal will come down to how he plans to sell Brexit in the post-coronavirus landscape. Is it via a vision of a new, self-sufficient nation where British is best – or as a champion of free trade where consumers have more choice and cheaper food?Whatever the prime minister decides, one section of his new party will be left disappointed.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ce8e0edd797476cc03f705a2bcd4acebb9b97db/116_0_3823_2296/master/3823.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7cc8132077c553dc41663ddaf1255ad","title":"great british art quiz heritage doncaster","story":"Heritage Doncaster set today’s quiz, which enables you to explore the art collection of British museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questions along the wayThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Now it’s finally over. I am very happy for the person who found it.”An eccentric New Mexico millionaire named Forrest Fenn said he hid the bronze chest in the Rockies in 2010. The only clues to the prize’s whereabouts were located in a cryptic 24-line poem written by Fenn and added to the last pages of his autobiography, The Thrill of the Chase.“Begin it where warm waters halt  And take it in the canyon down,  Not far, but too far to walk.  Put in below the home of Brown,” reads the second stanza of Fenn’s poem that would send treasure hunters to scour five western states.\u0026nbspOn 7 June, Fenn, a former air force fighter pilot turned art and antiquities dealer, told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper that a man from the eastern US had recently located his treasure, which has variously been valued anywhere from $1m to $2m. According to Fenn’s website, it was found “under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago”.Neither the name of the finder nor the location of the treasure has been disclosed. “I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot,” Fenn wrote on his website.\u0026nbspThe discovery marks the end of a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any in history.“This has been a horrible ending to something that has been so extremely important in my life for eight years,” said Cynthia Meachum, who is part of a vibrant “chase” community of Fenn treasure seekers. “It has affected me a lot more than I thought it ever would.”According to Fenn, the idea that came to inspire so many was conceived in 1988 after he was diagnosed with cancer.\u0026nbspThe prospect of death made him think to leave part of his fortune, and even his own bones,\u0026nbspin a treasure chest somewhere in the mountains. When Fenn recovered, the idea persisted, and he meticulously curated the contents of the chest for years.\u0026nbspFenn described a “necklace that’s about 2,000 years old, and it has fetishes made out of quartz crystal and cast gold jaguar claws, and it’s absolutely wonderful”, in a 2018 interview with the . “There are two ancient Chinese jade carvings of human faces.\u0026nbspYou just want to cry when you see them.”Fenn hoped the treasure would be an adventure that could get people “off the couch” and into the outdoors. “He provided us all with great adventure,” said Dent, who searched twice a week for years in northern New Mexico.Yet in the course of looking for Fenn’s chest, as many as five people have died, and Fenn has been criticized for endangering lives, enabling an unhealthy obsession, and even lying about the treasure’s existence.“I would implore him that he stop this nonsense,” the New Mexico state police chief, Pete Kassetas, said after a treasure hunter’s body was retrieved from the Rio Grande River in 2017, days after he had gone missing. He told ABC: “I want people to have fun, and I want people to be adventurous, but the reality is when you have $2m or so, as it’s rumored to be, at stake, people make poor decisions.”There are the stories of people quitting their jobs and emptying their bank accounts to join the chase. Fenn himself has received death threats and been the victim of break-in attempts at his house.\u0026nbspOthers have claimed the whole thing is an outright hoax.\u0026nbsp“I believe there never was any hidden treasure,” said Linda Bilyeu, the ex-wife of Randy Bilyeu, who died searching for the treasure. “Fenn is a corrupt man who seeks attention any which way he could achieve.”The controversy has continued even after its purported discovery. The absence of photos or information on the location of the chest has led some to question whether it was found at all – though Fenn has promised to elaborate in the coming days.“Give us something, so we know if we were close,” said Meachum, who made 200 trips and invested thousands of hours. “ I have no closure at this point.”“A third think it’s a hoax,” said Dent. “A third think it was never found.\u0026nbspAnd then there are the rest of us that think this is great.\u0026nbspSomeone found it.

Whether it’s adoption in Juno, surrogacy in Baby Mama or infertility in Raising Arizona, when it comes to women’s wombs, film execs have decided they need to throw in a good chuckle to make the subject more palatable. Just in case the grim reality of it all drives viewers away screaming in horror.Private Life is a comedy about infertility but rather than using it as a plot device, it delves into the nitty gritty of IVF, egg donation and adoption, showing what a long, hard and lonely slog it really is. Its story of a middle-aged couple in New York struggling to conceive – inspired by writer and director Tamara Jenkins’ own experiences – feels genuinely authentic. It’s an intimate\u0026nbspand unflinching look at the pain and heartache of infertility that is deeply compassionate and, at times, very funny.Released at the end of 2018 on Netflix, it was given a warm pat on the back by critics before being forgotten fairly swiftly in the deluge of other offerings on the streaming platform. Which is a crying shame as it’s up there with the likes of Marriage Story and Roma as one of the platform’s finest originals. A large part of this is down to Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti as Rachel and Richard, a successful artistic couple in their 40s who are not just emotionally spent but also financially bust after countless failed IVF cycles. They’re still determined to cast the fertility net far and wide by making one last-ditch attempt at IVF as they also explore adoption.But their rocky road to parenthood has left its mark. She is anxious, overwrought and on the edge. He is snappy, frustrated and plain exhausted. Their relationship is on the verge of imploding and they’re barely holding it together for their medical appointments. Their disapproving sister-in-law Cynthia (the always brilliant Molly Shannon) snipes that they’re “fertility junkies”. While Richard insists to his wife as they’re forced to spend another $10,000 on surgery: “We’re not insane, we’re normal.”Separately, it’s always a joy to spend time in Hahn and Giamatti’s company but together they are a formidable duo. Their performances are wonderfully naturalistic they breathe life into their roles by filling the jagged corners of their characters with poignancy. Hahn is outstanding as she teeters between barely contained rage and raw vulnerability while Giamatti skillfully conveys how dejected Richard has become, beaten down by his own sadness. Both are equally compelling as they demonstrate in their different ways how this primal need to have a child does not listen to reason or to a beloved spouse or to anyone really but their own spluttering biological clock. Even if it threatens to tip into something toxic and unhealthy.Things take a turn when they decide to ask their stepniece Sadie (Kayli Carter), a 25-year-old college dropout who is trying to figure out what to do with her life, to be their egg donor. She’s game but perhaps still too emotionally immature to grasp the full implications of what she’s signing on for. Jenkins reveals how a deeply private matter like infertility soon becomes public property your body grabbed by strangers’ hands (in one scene a doctor asks Rachel if she likes prog rock midway through a medical procedure) and your grief casually laid bare for friends and families. She’s also adept in finding the wry humour that lurks within darker moments with plenty of bittersweet laughs along the way.Her script exposes some of the conflicting messages that we’re fed as a society about fertility especially how women are told to go forth and forge a career and then chided for waiting too long to try to have a baby. It also touches on the other ways women’s bodies betray them as they age when the hell of menopause kicks in, as Cynthia, plucking out a chin hair one night, discovers. The film doesn’t gloss over the repetitive nature of the fertility hamster wheel. Not just with the constant injections, the mind-numbing paperwork, the faceless waiting rooms and how tooth-pullingly awkward each step is. But also the seemingly endless cycle of burgeoning hope that is wiped out by crushing disappointment and heartbreak.Private Life shows us that despite the tears, the anguish and the emotional scars that linger on, it’s this hope which refuses to be extinguished. And that is what makes us human."},{"url":null,"title":"spike lee race relations today are a direct response to having a black president","story":"Prior to the release of Da 5 Bloods, the director takes questions from readers, film-makers and politicians about George Floyd, Covid-19 and the worst thing about actorsFor more than three decades,\u0026nbspSpike Lee\u0026nbsphas been one of the most vital forces in film-making.His latest movie, Da 5 Bloods – about four African American veterans who return to Vietnam in search of the remains of their squad leader – is described by Peter Bradshaw as “a blast of satire and emotional agony about …\u0026nbspthe fact that black deaths matter”.Last week, Lee released a new short film that spliced footage from his classic 1989 movie Do the Right Thing with the arrests of George Floyd and Eric Garner, both of which led to their deaths – proof that, even after three decades in the business, his work remains relevant.On Wednesday, the director, 63, spoke to the  over video chat from his office in Brooklyn, New York. He was ebullient as he answered questions sent in by readers and famous fans, often prefacing his responses to his peers with enthusiastic expressions of respect and affection.You’ve always set an example of being outspoken about the things that matter to you in the film industry and beyond. Do you feel you’ve ever been penalised for that?What’s up, David! Yeah, but when you speak truth to power there’s going to be resistance. You know that going in. Whatever they’ve dished out has not stopped me from what I’ve wanted to do for the past four decades. Thank you for the question.Do you ever get tired of people asking you your views on race relations in the US?Yes. I don’t mind being asked it’s how I’m asked. Many times, reporters are working on the assumption I’m speaking on behalf of 40 million African Americans. Which is not the case at all.What is the most challenging part of working with actors?They start acting crazy. Hahaha! I love you, Halle, love you, love you. Jungle Fever was Halle’s first film!If you could describe yourself in five words, what would they be?That’s very hard. I can’t do it. Now, my wife could, but not me. What would she say? I don’t wanna know. No – I do know, I just don’t wanna hear it! Hahaha! No – I know, I just don’t wanna hear it again! Hahaha!Reality sometimes overcomes fantasy and the pandemic is a perfect example. Do you think future movies will be able to ignore an event of this magnitude, or will their authors be forced to deal with it? Lina, I love you, I love you, I love you. Be safe, because I wanna see you and give you a big hug when we get over this thing. I think artists are gonna respond in many different ways to this pandemic. Movies, documentaries, novels, paintings, photographs, books: there’s gonna be great art coming out of this. And historians many years from now will specifically go to see how artists commented.Where would you be if you weren’t in the US?If I couldn’t live in America, I would live in the People’s Republic of Brooklyn. Hahaha!When I watch the protests in the US, the sense I get is one of overwhelming tiredness. Tired of being shot in the street. Tired of waiting for progress. Tired of the never-ending struggle. How do you cope with weariness when injustice never sleeps? And what is the role of art in keeping us awake?David, that’s a great question. I was very impressed when I met you more than once in London. You’re doing a great job, you’re fighting the good fight. You know the answer. The struggle continues and you just gotta keep fighting. So keep fighting!Given slavery was the norm in all human civilisation until the 19th century, why do you think the US in particular struggles to deal with the consequences?Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody it’s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike – that’s how America dominates.Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?\u0026nbspFirst of all, I gotta give love! My man’s not only a doctor, he’s a film-maker! That’s the only time I’ve heard that combination for me that’s like two sides of the brain. But I gotta say, love your films, love your films, love your films and one day I hope to meet you in person.This may sound like a trite answer, my brother Dr George Miller, but storytelling is just part of being a human being. It’s what we do, from the very beginning, when we were writing shit on caves and whatnot. That’s how we communicate.What moment or moments of all those you put on the screen most surprised you with its cultural impact?\u0026nbspDo the Right Thing. People still going back to that film, especially today. How can you look at the NYPD’s murder of Radio Raheem without thinking about Eric Garner and now Mr Floyd? It came out 31 years ago.\u0026nbspI’m curious – since directors have no idea how any other director directs, because we’re never there – when you’re in that intense groove during weeks, months of shooting, what do you do to maintain your vision for your film off the set? Do you prep, defocus to clear your head for the next day’s possibilities, socialise, stay isolated and meditative?\u0026nbspMichael Mann! Thank you for your question. Big fan of your work. It depends on the film, the scene, how I’m feeling that day. How the actors might be feeling, hahaha! You know what I mean! You know what I’m talking about! You just gotta go with the flow and the vibrations. You know better than me, Michael: this whole thing’s about vibrations that we give back and forth.How did you get Nelson Mandela involved in Malcolm X?I knew people that were close to Mandela and while we were shooting in Cairo we made arrangements to go to Soweto to film him. One of the greatest experiences ever. His only feature film is Malcolm X!I feel the most effective way to bring about change to the key areas of criminal justice, health care, education equality and childcarenutrition is by allocating enormous funds do you agree?That’s the director of Apocalypse Now, which has two homages in Da 5 Bloods. And the Godfather trilogy. I’m not gonna disagree. And his wine is great, too. That’s my brother.\u0026nbspYou strongly supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020: are you going to vote for Joe Biden?Nina Simone said that it is an artist’s duty to reflect the times. For the first time, it feels as though people of all races from all over the world have seen the light and are demanding an end to this evil. What role do artists and the arts in general play in this unique time, where we have the world’s attention and true change seems like it might be in our grasp?Thank you for your questions. I think the role that artists take is the role they choose. All art is not the same and many artists refrain from politics in their work and feel it’s their job to entertain. This is something I’ve learned as I’ve got older: it is an artist’s inidual choice to do what they want to do. Any artist who says they’re not going to comment? That’s their choice.You have given voice to so many issues over the years that haven’t gone away\u0026nbsphow do you feel about where we are and are you hopeful for the future?John and I go way, way back. Our first film together was Do the Right Thing. John is one of the most beautiful, sincere human beings I’ve ever met in my life. I love John. That’s my guy. You know, a lot of the time, shit’s fucked up, but you just gotta fight the good fight. You know that better than me, John.The long and terrible exploitation of black people lies at the heart of continuing brutal racism, not only in the US, but here as well. Christopher Logue wrote this in his poem Know Thy Enemy: “He does not care what colour you are  Provided you work for him.” How do we unite people of all races to know their real enemy?Ken Loach?! The heavyweights! Ken, my brother, I’m honoured. Ken, as you know, you are one of the great film-makers. So thank you for taking time out. I wanna meet you. Everybody who’s asked me questions who I’ve never met before: when this thing is over, I wanna sit down with you guys and talk and vibe. We don’t have to talk about cinema we can talk about football.But Ken, this is a great question. You gotta hold the mirror up. They gotta see what they look like, what they sound like and the hate they’re representing.Why did eight years of Obama fail to make substantial enough change to race relations in the US?Very good question. But you have to understand: race relations – which have gotten worse – are a direct response to having a black president.\u0026nbspHas anything fundamentally changed for the good since 1965?That’s a hard question. We just buried King George Floyd.Did you think race would still be such an issue in the US when you made Do the Right Thing?\u0026nbspYes, but I never imagined this. What’s made it worse for me is the cameraphones. Before, you just read articles about it. Now, you are seeing these horrific murders. That makes all the difference in the world. The image of King George Floyd being suffocated for the last eight and a half minutes of his life went global and that is why we’ve had marches globally. People round the world saw a human being with this cop’s knee pressed against our brother’s neck, crying out for his deceased mother. You know what? As he was dying, I believe he saw his mother. His mother came to him in his last breaths.That image hit people’s hearts all round the world and that’s why people took to the streets in England. Get a globe, spin it and, wherever you stop, there’s a good chance people were marching.\u0026nbspWe need a new Do The Right Thing now.No. As long as I’m alive, there will be no remake and, if they try, I’m coming back from the dead to stop it. Hahaha! I promise you, I will come back from the pearly gates, from the upper room, to stop a remake. So help me God. I will bring him with me, and Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Bill Nunn, Frank Sinatra. Anybody that’s passed we’ll all come back to stop a remake.\u0026nbspBamboozled didn’t just stun critics, it stumped them, like Sly Stone’s There’s A Riot Goin’ On, or Kara Walker’s work. Like those pieces of black art, they couldn’t quite figure it out, because there was no spot in there for them to feel comfortable critiquing it. So, too many just attacked it with this “you’ve made the wrong kind of black art” response. At least, that’s my take. Why do you think the same white critics (and a few black ones) who praised Do The Right Thing were outright dismayed by (in my opinion) one of your best films?I guess they felt guilty watching it. They might have felt they were being targeted by Spike Lee. They weren’t – unless they were running around with blackface at a very young age. Which is what’s now coming out: all these politicians in the US who are blacked-up in college photos.\u0026nbspWould you consider doing a British-set film with British actors? Especially as the US and UK share many similar racial politics issues.Which of your films are you most disappointed by in terms of their critical and commercial reception?People missed Bamboozled. 25th Hour. Miracle at St Anna. The biggest one is Chi-Raq. I think that film is gonna find an audience who’ll understand what I was doing 20 years from now.If you could go forward or backward in time to witness a historic or personal event, what would you want to see or experience first-hand, and why?Well, first of all, I have to give my love to Rosario. The first time I saw her was in Larry Clark’s Kids and I’ve been very lucky to have her in two of my films: She Got Game and 25th Hour.\u0026nbspRosario, I love you, I love you, I love you. That’s a really good question. I would have liked to have been at Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech in Washington DC in 1964. I was alive I was seven years old. To have heard those words with my own ears …Would you cast an implausible person of colour in a historical drama for the sake of ersity, eg casting a black soldier in Custer’s seventh cavalry? What were your feelings about Ryan Murphy’s alternative history Hollywood, which placed persons of colour, gay people and women in positions of power they never achieved? When I cast two black actors and a white actor as best-friend factory workers in Blue Collar, I knew it was an unlikely pairing, but not implausible – therefore worth doing.Oooh! My brother! Hollywood: I’ve yet to see it, but I’m gonna check it out.\u0026nbspWere there no black soldiers in Custer’s seventh cavalry? Also – and I love Paul that’s my brother – I would do that film, but Custer would not be the hero. He would be the villain and I would tell it from the viewpoint of the Native Americans. One day!\u0026nbspDoes the recent win for Green Book, and that for Driving Miss Daisy 30 years ago, reflect the inability of the liberal, white US to confront the seriousness of racism in the US?I’m gonna pass on that question. It does me no good to talk – especially in this time we’re living in – about stuff which is insignificant. People are dying every day.\u0026nbspDo you think Michael Jordan will ever let anyone make a movie about his life and times … and would you do it? I ask while shaving my head …\u0026nbspHahaha! You’re a great actor, but I don’t know if you could handle “the rock”, my man. Two separate skills. You can’t do Mike on the court without some special effects from ILM. I don’t think he’s gonna allow anybody to play him in a narrative film while he’s alive – and he might put that in his will, too. Jackson, Tyson, Jordan: which Michael has been the greatest influence on you?I’ve worked with all three and all three I consider good friends. I’ve been blessed.\u0026nbspDid you ever have political conversations with Michael Jackson? Was he knowledgeable and engaged about such things beyond a surface level?Oh, Michael knew what was going on! Look at that film we made in Brazil: They Don’t Care About Us. It was an anthem when he was alive it’s even more of one now. We had some deep conversations. He was very aware. All you have to do is listen to the music and read the lyrics. As a grown man, he’s not talking about ABC. He’s saying whole different stuff.When did you first decide to cross from fiction to nonfiction? Why? For me, it all falls under the umbrella of storytelling. Love your documentaries, Asif, keep doing your thing.I realise this is very general, but I’m wondering: why are movies such a powerful and magical form of expression for you?I love Jim. We were at NY grad school at the same time. He was three years ahead for my class –\u0026nbspwhich included Ernest Dickinson and Ang Lee –\u0026nbsphe’s our hero, because with Stranger than Paradise he provided a blueprint of how we could crack into this industry. Jim was living proof it could be done. I strongly believe that prejudice is learned from an early age and that childhood lasts a lifetime. So, do you agree in order for children to grow up with empathy, more films should be made, specifically aimed at children, that address critical life issues such as racism – and would you consider making one?Which actor from the past would you have liked to direct the most?I would have loved to work with Paul Newman. And Marlon Brando. I’m sorry I never had a chance to work with Sidney Poitier. I did work with Harry Belafonte. I would have loved to work with Dorothy Dandridge.Why do so many white people teach their children to fear black people?You’ve created balanced, compelling and humane white characters in many of your films. Why do many similarly talented white film-makers not create compelling black characters?They probably didn’t grow up around black people. Also: the minorities know more about the majority and it’s not vice-versa because we’re swamped by the majority culture.\u0026nbspOccasionally, I get mistaken for you have you been mistaken for me?What’s up, Mike, my brother! I haven’t had the honour yet! Peace and love.Da 5 Bloods is on Netflix from 12 June "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be63c15fe019d35f44c209077deb53b4c9d6fd1c/0_79_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcdfdd5d27967db3c8842ad4976d16b3","title":"premier league restart preview leicester","story":"With a Champions League place in sight, Brendan Rodgers asked his players to watch the Netflix documentary The Last Dance in lockdownWhat\u0026nbspwas the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Leicester were surpassing expectations, sitting third in the table as a result of performances that suggested Brendan Rodgers is on course to fulfil the club’s aim of building a team with more dimensions than the sensational 2016 title winners. For a while they even looked like they might challenge Liverpool: they racked up a 9-0 win at Southampton as part of a club-record eight consecutive top-flight wins, all while playing with verve, skill and intelligence. That dream ended in December with consecutive defeats by Manchester City and Liverpool.\u0026nbspThen, in the new year, Leicester were hit hard by the injury to their inspirational midfielder Wilfried Ndidi, winning only one league game in seven. But when he returned to full fitness, Leicester regained their best form. In their last match before lockdown they showed their attacking might with a 4-0 thrashing of Aston Villa, with Jamie Vardy seemingly back to his best and Harvey Barnes demonstrating the ability that will make him great if he produces it more regularly.What about now? That match against Villa was not all sunlight: Ricardo Pereira suffered a knee injury that will prevent him from playing in the remainder of the season. He will be difficult to replace because he is one of the best right-backs in the league, secure defensively and superb going forward. James Justin has impressed in his few outings since joining from Luton last summer and will now get a chance to show what he can do consistently. Meanwhile, the exceptionally talented left-back Ben Chilwell, who has had some worrying off-days this season, needs to recapture the form that has led to Chelsea being linked with a big transfer bid.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Their gifted young players must demonstrate they can sustain top performances during a high-stakes run-in. Losing the Carabao Cup semi-final to Aston Villa was a wounding blow. Qualifying for the Champions League would be an admirable achievement and they go into their last nine matches with an eight-point lead over fifth-place Manchester United – whom they host in their final game of the season. More consistency from Barnes, Chilwell, Youri Tielemans and Demarai Gray would be particularly welcome and, of course, Justin will have to rise to a big challenge. To help focus their minds Rodgers recommended his emerging talents devote part of lockdown to watching The Last Dance, the Netflix documentary about Michael Jordan. “If you want to know what being elite is and what being at the very top level in terms of preparation is, and focus and improvement and being better and winning, this is what you should be watching,”\u0026nbsphe said.Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? No breaches were reported. The main concern was for the wellbeing of Rodgers, who fell ill with coronavirus two weeks after their last match. “I wasn’t well and it was later detected I had the virus,”\u0026nbsphe said.\u0026nbsp“A week after that, my wife had it. We spent about three weeks feeling the effects. We were nowhere near as bad as a lot of people but we lost our smell and taste for three weeks. We lost our strength, so I had a little feeling of whatever it must be like. It was tough.”\u0026nbspAny unsungcommunity heroes? Kasper Schmeichel donated £20,000 to Age UK in March. “Let’s do all we can to help the elderly,” the goalkeeper said.Key player in the run-in? Ndidi. The Nigerian secures central midfield, providing assurance to Leicester’s fine defence and talented attackers. Without him Leicester are not as confident or secure. Even though Kelechi Iheanacho has improved so much he often warrants a start ahead of Ayoze Pérez, Leicester remain quite dependent on Vardy, still the best finisher at the club.End-of-season prediction\u0026nbspLeicester will finish in the top four and could satisfy their craving for a trophy by landing the FA Cup.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b46f2b120067462db46f3a3bfdfe031f606765/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e70027bb760f9ddc6f5fa31a564adba","title":"lima community faces concentration of covid 19 cases in pictures","story":"• All photographs by Florence Goupil, who received a grant from the Covid-19 National Geographic emergency fund for journalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1f8e50fd583471a0543292c6ccdd1e916ae1a4/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b11342e3fbe1321d9b47bccc4bad13d","title":"lockdown shopping have you ordered items that werent what you expected","story":"Whether you ordered the wrong item or it it wasn’t quite what you expected, we’d like to hear from youWith around 50,000 new businesses signing up to eBay UK in April, more people appear to be buying online due to lockdown.If you have ordered an item that was not quite what you expected, we want to hear from you.What did you buy and why was it unexpected?

So I order lots of samples and create a collage on a distinct section of wallI am not saying I do not live an exciting and fulfilling life, but I enjoy ordering A4 samples of wallpaper online. I am saying that I truly believe the moment capitalism spiralled out of control was when homeware stores started charging for tester pots of paint. I am saying I’ve bought a plant from Homebase to cover my shame when walking out with rolls and rolls of the test wallpaper one tears off the racks like clingfilm.All of this forms what I am going to refer to as the “renter’s renovation”. Long-term renters will know that only minimal changes to decor are permitted. Renters will also know that a single gossamer strand of cobweb spotted in a moving-out inventory check can see a portion of deposit chalked off.\u0026nbspBut, like most of us, I love to put my stamp on a place to match up our personality and our environment. And I love wallpaper. I square the renter’s dilemma by using literal squares I order lots of sample wallpaper and create a collage on a distinct section of wall.I affix the wallpaper using glue in the corners and middle, which can be easily and totally cleaned off, rather than proper permanent paste. Though I despise the term “feature wall”, that is essentially what this process produces: a pleasing, DIY display of colour and pattern and design.Wallpaper, like everything, goes in and out of fashion. When I was growing up, it was definitely out of fashion. Now it has had a renaissance. Queen Anne even introduced a wallpaper tax (in 1712, it lasted until 1836). One way people got round it was to buy plain paper and stencil it. Which I like to think is the sort of creative-thinking antecedent to what I do. I’ve never actually understood why this tax was introduced, so I assume Anne had some sort of traumatic wallpaper-related incident and held a grudge.Many styles have flourished throughout history: Baroque designs, hand-painted Chinese landscapes, silk damasks, floral patterns, flock, 1960s Pop Art varieties, the orange-and-brown scrub-down vinyl of the 1970s, abstract. The Arts and Crafts stylings of the King of Wallpaper, William Morris, remain favourites of mine.

Parkrun sadly remains in hibernation but everything else has bloomed. In my local park there are the joggers, cyclists, speed walkers, guys doing chin-ups on the goalposts, iniduals stretching on mats, small groups doing workouts and the yoga enthusiasts with their sun salutations. Meanwhile, next door, the neighbours are impressively in the back yard every morning, hamstrings at the ready for Joe Wicks.Before the coronavirus, the gym industry was booming. Ten million people – one in seven of the entire population – had a gym membership and as a country we were spending a record £5bn on keeping fit.Almost all of that spending has come to a shuddering halt, with Britain’s 7,000 gyms and leisure centres still firmly shut. Will enough of us ever go back, now that new habits have been formed (the expansion in cycling is remarkable) and we have learned how to keep fit without paying costly monthly fees?People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Reopening day for leisure facilities is scheduled for 4 July, with gyms in stage three of the government’s Covid-19 recovery roadmap. But if they do reopen on that date, they will look very, very different. In Switzerland, when gyms reopened in May after a two-month lockdown, members were told to arrive and leave in their gym clothes to avoid changing rooms, group exercise classes were banned as they simply couldn’t feasibly meet two-metre distancing requirements in studios, while lots of fitness machines were marked out of bounds. Users are expected to thoroughly wipe down every machine after use, with an army of cleaners thoroughly disinfecting the kit every hour.The keenest users of gyms – urban 20- to 40-year-olds – have been among the worst hit by coronavirus job losses, which will only magnify when the furlough scheme ends. Monthly direct debits to the gym will be the first thing to be scrubbed.What’s more, many gyms are now in the wrong place. If office workers do not return in any number until after the summer, with a possible permanent increase in working from home, city centre gyms will start to look somewhat redundant.The gym chain owner and former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne believes people prefer the more structured exercise routines that gyms offer.“We recently asked our members if they would be confident to return to their local health club in June or July if the correct safety measures are in place and more than two-thirds agreed they would,” he said as he joined a campaign launched this week to back the safe reopening of gyms.We can also be certain that the allure of outdoor activity will lessen into autumn. Who is really going to work out in the park on a cold, dark and miserable evening in November?But, ahem, what about the delicate matter of sweat? Can’t say I fancy a cloud of no-pain, no-gain sweat wafting into me as I venture through a gym in an era of coronavirus.The industry knows it’s the question on the lips of many a club user. In a myth-busting Q\u0026ampA guide sent to the clubs by ukactive this week, the very first question is: “Can you pass Covid-19 from sweat?” And their answer? “No, there is no current evidence that the virus can be spread by perspiration (sweat).” It cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although it admits there is “limited data available on sweatperspiration”.In truth, the industry is putting a brave face on calamitous times. It knows that thousands of gyms and leisure operators could be forced out of business by crippling rent payments, which come back into effect at the end of this month.That’s an issue for returning gym goers, too. Who is going to pay upfront for another 12-month gym membership to a club teetering on bankruptcy?Unless the industry follows the Ryanair playbook and offers huge cut-price offers to get us back, or receives a government leg-up (it is pushing hard for a cycle-to-work-style tax rebate on gym membership), then it faces grim times indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82b78991b1e74ff434229e94d68750d439d84a6c/231_0_1691_1444/master/1691.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0b585dcb2c1b4cf8f6b1ffc1b7cc5fae 1320w","title":"stormzy to donate 10m to black british causes over ten years","story":"The uncomfortable truth that our country continuously fails to recognise and admit is that black people in the UK have been at a constant disadvantage in every aspect of life – simply due to the colour of our skin.

As young children, the Atlanta-born sisters acted in big-budget movies when they decided to ersify into music in their early teens, they were swiftly snapped up by Beyoncé’s management company (they later made a cameo appearance in her visual album Lemonade). Since then, the duo have established themselves as precociously capable all-rounders, receiving Grammy nods for their 2018 debut The Kids Are Alright and becoming regulars on teen sitcom Grown-ish (there’s also a game-changing profile boost on the horizon, with Halle due to star as Ariel in Disney’s live-action remake of The Little Mermaid).Despite their lifelong entanglement in the showbiz machine, Chloe and Halle are not your average child stars. Their music has never been tween-friendly chart-bait\u0026nbsp– instead, they emerged with a strain of sophisticated and elegant R\u0026ampB that you’d have a hard time categorising as juvenilia. On their second album, the pair double down on this mode, matching sumptuous harmonies with intricate beats. In service to their impeccable cool and class, the pair swerve big choruses and obvious melodies, and exercise restraint when erting away from their signature style.

She fronts a PJ Harvey-ish rock outfit under her own name, and featured in the 2006 documentary Afro-Punk, about black punk and hardcore performers. She leads and composes for a string sextet, the Psychochamber Ensemble, its repertoire ning pop, R\u0026ampB and chamber pieces. In addition, she has been a musical director for big bands, and most recently, written major scores for films including The Assistant, Mudbound, Come Sunday and The Last Thing He Wanted.Her latest is for Josephine Decker’s Shirley – a psychodrama based, loosely, on the life of the writer Shirley Jackson – and is a fascinating piece of score writing. As well as using piano and string quartet, Tamar-kali also multi-tracks her voice on six of the album’s 21 short tracks, but it bears little resemblance to the voice you hear on her rock work. Instead, she sings in a full-throated choral howl that recalls folk singers the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir (contributors to Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares projects) – an ecstatic but eerily vibratoless sound, embroidered with whoops and microtonal dissonances.There are moments – the chugging, Michael Nyman-ish string stabs, the tightly wound clockwork passages for pizzicato strings – that sound like they were plotted on graph paper. Tamar-kali is better when she’s exploring the sonorities of the string quartet – shivery tremolo violins, spiccato cello bounces, col legno effects with the back of the bow – and creating tense sonic textures that are incredibly effective at conjuring an air of claustrophobic terror.

I have seen this letter, and I abhor this isive identity politics that’s being levelled at Priti Patel. I’m incredibly proud to be part of the most erse government in history.”Former chancellor Sajid Javid called the letter “utterly misguided and irresponsible”.“Imagine listening to an ethnic-minority woman’s history of suffering racist abuse - and then deciding that you’d rather condemn the victim than her abusers,” he tweeted.The letter was coordinated by the shadow community cohesion minister, Naz Shah, and was also signed by other senior Labour MPs including Tulip Siddiq, Kate Osamor, Chi Onwurah, Seema Malhotra, Dawn Butler and Rosena Allin-Khan.In a Commons debate on Monday, the Labour MP Florence Eshalomi suggested the government did not understand the anger felt by people and the desire to tackle structural racism.Patel told the Commons she was “really, really saddened” by Eshalomi’s criticism and added: “It must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband’s in order to advance her career.In the letter, the Labour MPs tell Patel that “being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism” and that experiences should not be used to “silence” others.They write: “In conclusion, we ask you to reflect on your words and to consider the impact it had towards black communities in the UK trying to highlight their voices against racism.\u0026nbsp“Rest assured that Asian and ethnic minority colleagues on this side of the house will not use their experiences to silence our black colleagues, but will use our shared experiences to stand behind them and support their voices to lead us on standing up against the distinct form of racism black communities in the UK and across the globe face.”Patel said on Monday that “thugs and criminals” would be brought to justice for pockets of violence at the largely peaceful anti-racism demonstrations in London at the weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f175d583cc5f1d439dfaf4e4420bd8a60232ff8/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36bf20954ab1ae039fbd53758dbc8c9d","title":"novelty of being on tv wears off for matt hancock as he defends app","story":"It was clear Hancock’s news on track and trace would not be good, or else Boris would have given itYou could tell the news wasn’t going to be that great when we got the cast list. If the new track and trace system had been an overwhelming success, there would have been every chance that Boris Johnson would have rolled out of bed to take the credit. Instead, we got Matt Hancock, everybody’s favourite punchbag, still wearing his favourite pink tie that has so far brought him nothing but bad luck.It’s hard not to feel just a little sorry for Matt. His vaulting ambition that led him to ignore all his gut instincts about having nothing to do with a Boris Johnson government has brought him nothing but hubris. He knew Boris was a wrong ‘un from the off. He even said as much during his short-lived campaign to be Tory party leader last summer. But when faced with a choice of acting on principle or grasping whatever cabinet post was going begging, Mattbeth chose the latter.His eyes are now dead, his shoulders slumped. The enjoyment of being on TV at the Downing Street press conference – The lights! The greasepaint! – has long since worn off. Because he knows he only ever gets the crap gigs. The ones that no one else wants to do. And even Westminster’s very own Mr Tigger, a man who could once achieve orgasm just by polishing his enamel NHS badge, can’t even muster a veneer of enthusiasm. The briefing is just a chore to be rushed through while giving away as little information as possible.Matt began with the usual white noise. Although the number of cases was actually up from a day earlier, the figures continued to fall. Er, hello? It was clear that neither Matt nor the person who had written this crap had bothered to make sure if it made any sense. He had a plan and it was working. It would just have been nice to know that the government had been hell-bent on killing more than 50,000 people – and counting – right from the start of the pandemic.“The system will be world class,” he added hopefully. This sounded like more of an aspiration for some time in the future and certainly a significant downgrade on “world beating”. Nor was there any attempt to explain why it was taking so long to implement the system. Most other countries had seen test, track and trace as an essential weapon in fighting coronavirus back in February we had only really got round to thinking about it seriously a month or so ago.Matt ended with a final plea. He understood people’s anger about Black Lives Matter but could people please stick to the rules and keep to small, socially distanced groups of six. Not for the first time during this public health crisis, satire had to take a back seat. Because the person the health secretary was about to hand over to was Dido Harding, the new chief executive of track and trace, who in a previous job on the board of the jockey club had let the Cheltenham festival go ahead when many other health experts were suggesting it should be cancelled.So it’s going to take Typhoid Dido quite a while until the number of people she’s prevented from getting the coronavirus outweighs the number she’s helped to infect. Which might help to explain why at least one third of the people who had been tracked down refused to give any details of their contacts. But on the plus side, they had managed to pick up about 32,000 contacts which meant that the 25,000 track and tracers had managed to make just over one successful call each over the past week. Making Britain Great Again.Come the questions, Door Matt got noticeably tetchier as journalist after journalist expressed their disappointment in the new system. Wouldn’t it have been better to wait until track and trace was working properly before easing lockdown measures? “No,” said Hancock. Because when it was world class it would be world class. There was no arguing with that.Nor could he give any further updates on his world beating app which only a month ago he had insisted would give the UK the edge in beating coronavirus. Matt just pretended he had never said the app was going to be any great shakes and that it would be ready when it was ready. As in never.Typhoid Dido did briefly try to come to the rescue. She was sure things would improve and that the track and tracers would soon be able to get hold of at least two people a week once they had learned to stop sending contacts texts at 3am. Teething problems and all that.She also said she had had one call from someone who had been delighted to be contacted as that had got him out of a barbecue. That must have been from someone on the Isle of Wight who had been due to go for drinks at the deputy editor of the Spectator’s house, where the guest list had included Tory MP, Bob Seely, Brexit chairman Richard Tice and journalist Isabel Oakeshott. Being told you had to self-isolate for 14 days would be a small price to pay to avoid that particular nightmare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b2be247c621733694a5732eaf7407e1eff6bd9f/154_0_3192_1916/master/3192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=250a07a8e62acc2a3de2e32d8ba48d7f","title":"brexit uk expected to backtrack on full eu border checks","story":"Source says government will take a ‘pragmatic and flexible’ approach to help businesses cope with impact of coronavirusThe government is expected to backtrack on its plan to introduce full border checks with the EU from 1 January 2021 over fears of the economic impact of coronavirus.The cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, is anticipated to make an announcement on Friday over border operations for when Brexit fully comes into effect at the end of the transition period.The UK had committed to introduce import controls on EU goods in the new year, but ministers are now expected to adopt a more flexible approach to prevent the departure compounding the chaos from Covid-19.A government source said: “We recognise the impact that coronavirus has had on UK businesses, and as we take back control of our laws and our borders at the end of this year, we will take a pragmatic and flexible approach to help business adjust to the changes and opportunities of being outside the single market and the customs union.”Gove will have the second joint committee agreed under the withdrawal agreement with European commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Friday.UK sources said that unless both sides agree to another such meeting before the end of July, it will be the last opportunity to request an extension to the transition period.Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted he will not ask for a delay, despite businesses and critics warning of the dangers of a departure without a trade agreement in place.A virtual summit between the prime minister and the EU chief Ursula von der Leyen to try to break the deadlock in trade negotiations has been scheduled for Monday.The negotiating teams have also agreed to “an intensified timetable” for July with possible discussions in person if public health guidelines enable them during the coronavirus pandemic.The European council president, Charles Michel, and the president of the European parliament, David-Maria Sassoli, will also join the political talks.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The UK and the EU have agreed an intensified timetable for FTA negotiations in July.“This new process will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings, both in London and Brussels assuming public health guidelines enable this.”The pace of talks will be scaled up so negotiators will meet in each of the five weeks between 29 June and 27 July, No 10 said.The UK’s 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals should not hinder the talks in its current form, with the rules having an exemption for those on official visits such as negotiations.The new details came after the fourth round of negotiations failed to reach a breakthrough last week.The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, lamented there having been “no significant areas of progress” as he accused the UK of having “backtracking” on the agreed political declaration.His counterpart in Downing Street, David Frost, said they would have to “intensify and accelerate” the process if there was to be any chance of an agreement. Both sides also said the remote meetings had reached their limit and that face-to-face meetings would be needed in order to progress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b143716c88576fcd713bd51766c974077eecb103/3175_2203_10517_6315/master/10517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b8027eb6c91700715ac43e9bc4be44","title":"how to use music to boost your running whether over a mile or a marathon","story":"From music’s effects on fatigue to its motivational properties, the right soundtrack is a powerful tool for improving your ability to run wellEveryone knows there’s a link between music and running. Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility.

A number of journalists not involved with BComs have also signed up, including the BBC presenter Gabby Logan and TalkSport host Laura Woods.“These last few weeks have brought an exhausting and overwhelming sense of frustration, grief and sadness, following the violent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Aubrey. Although these incidents occurred in the USA, the systemic racism that enables tragedies like this to occur also exists in the UK,” reads the letter.“The role of the sports media is highly influential in shaping our views, and a sports media that lacks ersity is not fit for purpose. We believe now is the time to hold the industry to account to ensure that the sector is truly inclusive from top to bottom.”Included in the seven-point plan is a call for all media outlets to establish external task forces dedicated to “reviewing, monitoring and challenging” their ersity aims, run compulsory unconscious and conscious bias training programmes for senior management using black facilitators, and ensure all BAME staff, including long-standing freelancers, are able to develop and enhance their career at their respective workplaces. There is a general acceptance within the industry that things need to change but that has been the case for some time yet little progress is ever made. That was even the case after Raheem Sterling made this a live issue in December 2018 after posting a message on Instagram in which the Manchester City and England winger accused certain publications of helping to “fuel racism” in this country.“We at BComs have been actively beating the drum about the greater need for ersity in the sports media for more than 10 years. It is wholly unacceptable that we have been having these conversations with you all, and your predecessors, with little to no change in some cases,” continues BComs’ letter. “Many of you have shown solidarity and support to the Black Lives Matter movement and we see this as a junction which could change the course of the industry. We hope you do too.”A spokesperson for  News \u0026amp Media said: “We welcome the\u0026nbspcall from BComs for more rapid change and better ersity across sports media, and would like to meet with BComs to discuss these plans in detail.“Last year GNM published our first report on pay and ethnicity - which showed that while we have made some progress, we also have much to do.\u0026nbspWe have set goals to improve representation at all levels and in all departments, and to reduce our pay gap over the long term. It is essential that our employees, just like our journalism, reflect the audiences and communities we serve.\u0026nbspWe will look at any suggestions from BComs and others on how the  can contribute to positive change across the news industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d7a61f9330bf8b3484f923284b60e14a1284d08/0_141_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4edde820489f08a8a8a5ab74f28d84b6","title":"collin osborne and paul hull i dont see many black players in key roles","story":"Two successful coaches discuss the grave shortage of BAME backroom staff among England’s Premiership clubsCollin Osborne still wonders why the call to coach representative rugby never came. Osborne worked for Harlequins for more than 20 years, arriving at the club shortly after rugby union turned professional and departing two years ago. In that time he ran the academy and was skills coach when Harlequins were crowned Premiership champions in 2012.It is not that he is bitter, nor does he wish to point fingers but having achieved his qualifications the year after the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster, Osborne – one of a handful of black coaches to work in the Premiership – feels the question is relevant. “As a senior coach, coaching at Harlequins I was never ever once offered or invited to coach any representative side. Surrey U11s to Surrey men – never. A lot of my contemporaries were. I was at one of the best clubs in Harlequins but I was never asked. I don’t know why it was.”With Osborne no longer at Harlequins the homegrown black and minority ethnic representation on coaching staffs in elite rugby in England is practically non-existent. Joe Shaw is skills and attacks coach at Saracens but the stark statistics show Paul Hull is the only black head coach or director of rugby in Premiership history, having been in charge of Bristol between 2009-11.The Black Lives Matter movement has led to introspection across the sporting landscape and this week the England footballer Raheem Sterling castigated his sport for the lack of opportunities available for black coaches.Given Osborne’s experience, it seems fair to ask whether the pathway exists in rugby, even if the difference in player participation numbers has to be taken into account. Osborne and Hull, who both reached their level five coaching qualification in 2008, feel the question will be more pertinent when the current generation of players are in early retirement. They are optimistic that some will land top coaching jobs should they wish.“If you look at the ersity in the England team, hopefully they will go on to coach and young black people will see that and want to follow them,” says Hull.Osborne echoes that sentiment. “I would be very saddened if players like Kyle Sinckler, Maro Itoje and Jonathan Joseph couldn’t get a coaching job if they wanted. I would be very surprised and disappointed if that were the case.”Contrast that, however, with the rest of upper echelons of the organisation where Maggie Alphonsi is the only black council member and there is no BAME representation on the board.“The stupid thing is that is the easier part of it to change,” says Osborne, now head coach of Wimbledon RFC. “Being a rugby coach is a very niche job, there aren’t that many people, white or black, who meet the criteria to do the job in the Premiership or at international level. But the last time I went to the RFU I was in a huge open-plan office and it was exceptionally white. There are loads of people who are qualified administrators, there are not a load of people qualified to be a rugby coach.”Hull is keen to stress coaching requires a specialised skill-set and it is not for everyone. There has to be the desire as well as the aptitude for it. Osborne agrees but he cannot fathom why there is such little representation on the backroom staff of clubs. And he has done his own research to prove it.Osborne recalls a time when the perception of black players was that “they’re all right in the sunshine but as soon as it gets cold they’re no good”. Those stereotypes are thankfully outdated but both men still see pigeon-holing black players as a barrier towards progress. “You find that a lot of coaches, this is not exclusively the norm, but a lot have played in positions where they have influenced the team,” says Hull, who now works at Prior Park College in Bath.“The hooker, the lineout leader in the second row, the No 9, the nine and 10. It tends to be those decision makers who become coaches. I don’t see that many black players in those key decision‑making roles that gives them the confidence to go into coaching. In those positions you are always in the tactical discussions. When you are in those discussions throughout your career then it’s natural to go into coaching.”Osborne recalls a promising black fly‑half in the Harlequins academy who, playing in a school match, was moved to the wing. “I had a chat with him afterwards and he said the teacher told him he was wasted at fly-half. The irony was that the only time they looked dangerous was when he came off his wing to fly-half, show and go, side-step, side-step, try. Unfortunately that is what you’re dealing with. I don’t think anyone goes out to think: ‘we’re going to keep you down’. It’s more a lack of thought and understanding and it comes down to stereotyping.”The media has a responsibility too. Not just to ersify but in terms of the language used. There can be a subconscious tendency to roll out cliches about “physical” Pacific Islanders, or the “natural athleticism” of black players, which in turn can shape perceptions. “Sometimes we’re not that conscious that what we say affects people’s thinking,” says Osborne. “The cliches come rolling off the tongue. In Maro’s case it’s not just his ability to jump higher than everyone else. He’s so strong at the lineout because he’s done his homework. Let’s give him credit for that.”Nonetheless, Osborne and Hull remain optimistic about the future but feel that consistent change has to come from the top.“Often a black person is asked about race but often it’s not us who should be asked the question,” says Hull. “I don’t mean to be aggressive in the slightest here but it’s not really our issue. We’re on the other end of it. The changes are not really going to be made by us, it’ll be elsewhere.“The incident with George Floyd has shone a light around the world and I think it will lead to massive, positive change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16dbc59c089360cbc0852349b44b2f00c323d793/510_259_3751_2250/master/3751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=381b20995213c1a1037d1961e98608d1","title":"twitter deletes 170000 accounts linked to china influence campaign","story":"Content focused on Covid-19 and the protests in Hong Kong and over George Floyd in the USTwitter has removed more than 170,000 accounts the social media site says are state-linked influence campaigns from China focusing on Hong Kong protests, Covid-19 and the US protests in relation to George Floyd.The company announced on Thursday that 23,750 core accounts – and 150,000 “amplifier” accounts that boosted the content posted by those core accounts – had been removed from the platform after being linked to an influence campaign from the People’s Republic.The researchers analysed 348,608 tweets between January 2018 and April 2020 and found most tweets were posted during business hours in Beijing between Monday and Friday, and dropped off on the weekends.The tweets usually contained images featuring Chinese-language text, with researchers finding that the primary targets of the campaign were people living in Hong Kong, followed by broader Chinese diaspora.One tactic the researchers observed in accounts that were excluded from the dataset were legitimate older accounts that had been hacked, or bought and then used as part of the campaign.For example, one account changed its photo from a Bangladeshi man to a Chinese woman and abruptly switched to posting in Chinese in opposition to the Hong Kong protests.The ASPI researchers said repurposed accounts on Facebook contributed a significant portion of the activity observed there.The major themes of the tweets were that that Hong Kong protesters were violent, and the US was interfering with the protests accusations about Guo the Taiwan election and praise of China’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Despite the removal of these accounts, the researchers found that the campaigns were persisting both on Twitter and Facebook through repurposed accounts and new ones.Focus has now shifted to the Black Lives Matter protests in the US, accusing the country of “hypocrisy for its criticism of the response by police to protests in Hong Kong, while the US’s own police and troops use violence against protests in the US, and warns Hong Kong protesters not to think they can rely on the US for support against China’s national interests”.ASPI found that the campaign operators also appeared to have sought to heavy engagement on some tweets to boost them to the the top of Twitter’s search for specific hashtags.“This allowed the campaign to effectively drown out organic activity on that hashtag for a period of time,” the researchers said.At the same time, Twitter also released the details of 1,152 accounts associated with promoting state-backed political propaganda from Russia, and 7,340 accounts promoting to Turkey’s AK party and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.“Technical signals point to the network being associated with the youth wing of the party and a centralised network that maintained a significant number of compromised accounts,” it said.Twitter said in the future, it would provide the archive of impression counts and other relevant information to understand the impact such campaigns have, and work with academic organisations to achieve that goal.This month Australian researchers found that thousands of pro-Trump, Republican or QAnon-related accounts had been boosting misinformation about the origins of Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic. Australia has sought comment from Twitter on whether it was undertaking similar analysis of these accounts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ed93343eceb39068a4ff051743a66cafbecfa66/0_414_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acd25415be1dafc8d83dd30846ed8c0d","title":"dreams of italy readers travel tips","story":"A friendly football bar, the ‘real’ sword in the stone, plus walks, festivals and fantastic food ... you responded in droves to our request for Italian highlights For an unforgettable day away from the bustle of Rome, walk part of the Via Appia Antica, among the oldest paved roads in the world. For a demanding but amazing hike, walk 11 miles from the historic Quo Vadis church (on the 118 bus route) to Castel Gandolfo, overlooking a volcanic lake and home to the Pope’s summer retreat. En route you’ll pass catacombs (the best being the San Sebastiano), the remains of Maxentius’s Villa and hundreds of glorious pine trees. Start early, wear comfortable shoes and carry water. Take the train back to Rome. Enjoy!JackArriving in Rome on the afternoon of a Coppa Italia Rome derby, we tried to find a bar showing the evening’s game in the Pigneto neighbourhood, where we were staying. We stumbled upon a craft beer pub (the Alvarado Street) covered in football scarves from around the world. All the seats had names taped on them, reserved for friends and regulars – but a couple of drinks and phone calls by the barman later and we had our own bean bags in among it all. Great beers and a great crowd – next time I’ll be bringing my Cardiff City scarf to add to their collection!AnyaLucignano, in eastern Tuscany near Arezzo, gets my vote. It’s small but perfectly formed, possessing all the essentials of an Italian hill town: imposing gates, watchtowers and ramparts. There’s a Medici-era fortress nearby a church rebuilt by Renaissance architectwriter Giorgio Vasari plus outstanding olive oil extolled by the likes of Strabo and Pliny the Elder. The time to go is during the Maggiolata spring festival, held the last two weekends of May, with flower-bedecked floats and a large tent where folks sit at communal tables to enjoy grilled Chianina steaks, pasta, wine and entertainment every evening. TheoZip. Tent open: the Dolomites. We’d woken to those jagged spires for almost a week. This morning’s vista was across the green valley to the shark fin of the Sassolungo. Circling it was the aim for the day. An espresso on the piazza in Canazei was for fuel. Then we headed for the Col Rodella gondola. It’s a gateway to another world nearly 2,000 metres up, where rolling meadows crash into spires of rock, cows moo, and ramblers scuttle like ants across the trails. Thirteen hours of walking took us over the col and into the vast Alpe di Siusi, the largest alpine plateau in Europe. Tired legs were later rewarded with a wine (or 10) at the bustling Bar Oma, back in Canazei’s quaint centre.Joseph FrancisFour readers recommended this place this week! EdIn rural Marche, not far from the Adriatic coast, Casal dei Fichi (flats from €870 a week) is a glorious place. So beautiful and relaxing that we seldom travel far from its peaceful grounds, inviting pool and stunning views. We might make a quick trip or two to the local market and vineyard to ensure we are well stocked for our stay, and an occasional lunch in one of the huge choice of local restaurants. That said, for the more active there is a wide range of activitiestrips that can be enjoyed, and hosts Ian and Bob are on hand to advise and assist. We can’t wait for these lockdown days to end so that we can escape to this little piece of heaven. DiThe Abbey of San Galgano (adults €4) is a glorious ruin, but the real reason you are there is to enter the small round Rotonda chapel in the grounds, in which you will see the “real” Sword in the Stone, plunged into solid rock by the knight Galgano, attempting to deny the angels. The sword sits in a perspex dome, protection against thieves. The mummified arms of one would-be thief remain there as a warning. Then ponder the similarities to the Arthurian legends. Coincidence? Gord PaynterFresh out of uni I visited Reggio di Calabria, city of my forebears, over Ferragosto and had a transformative experience. In this beautiful city, free of tour buses and souvenir shops, I observed a way of life both foreign and completely sensible. Seemingly everyone spent their days taking it slow: extended families gathering at the beach, strolling about town, having long outdoor meals, rambling along the stunning yet understated promenade (pictured). Something clicked: it dawned on me that people live this way and I could too. Years later I briefly lived in Italy and hope to move back with my family.Nick PostorinoAs a kid I spent many family holidays in Camogli, near Genoa. The topography of steep mountains rising from the coast forced the locals to build upwards, creating a labyrinth of alleys and stairways. Of course the food was good, great gelato and pasta, and the famous pesto genovese. But what stands out is the focaccia. Recco, just north of Camogli, is the home of a most delicious cheesy version that has spread – like the molten cheese inside it – over the whole area. Popping into a focacceria to get a pile of freshly baked focaccia slices and sharing them was the highlight of the day.Simon HoerHead north from Trento and you reach a curious mix of Italian and German language and culture around Siusi allo Sciliar. Visit San Valentino’s church, then take the cable car to the Seiser Alm, one of Europe’s highest mountain plateaux, with 240km of tracks and trails great for running, walking or biking. It’s perfect in spring or autumn: try staying in one of the family-run farms that offer local knowledge, homegrown produce and a friendly welcome. Public transport is excellent, and if you need a hand on the hills and with the altitude, e-bike hire means you can manage without a car.Tony WadeAt the centre of the Valchiavenna, north of Lake Como, lies the old town of Chiavenna, on the right bank of the river Mera. From the railway station we walked the short distance to the magnificent nature park and wildlife refuge that is the Parco delle Marmitte dei Giganti. Taking its main path overlooking the river, we continued on our way in seclusion towards Prosto, with its ancient bridge and church. Crossing the bridge, the path leads to the beautiful Acquafraggia waterfalls, whose soothing roar was completely mesmerising. We stayed at the brilliant Villa Très Jolie (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB).Robert ConnollyUp the road from San Gimignano is the equally picturesque medieval town of Volterra, but without the crowds of shuffling tourists – except for one weekend in August, when the town dresses up in its medieval finery and goes back in time. There are food stalls aplenty, musicians at every turn and pageantry to fill the eye. It is the best of Italy inasmuch as it is noisy and seemingly chaotic but enormous fun. It’s a great day out for a family or even a solo traveller. Modern currency is not accepted you have to change your euros into the historical equivalent and you then buy your street food with this. Confusingly, you then use euros if you stop for a drink or a coffee in a bar.Nick StringerWe were fortunate enough to discover a boating lake in a romantic corner of the Villa Borghese, a park in Rome. It was a haven from the long, hot queues of Rome’s tourist sites. We hired a boat. The joy of rowing around the small lake with the person I love is a pleasure I will never forget. The sound of a harp from a nearby musician beckoned us towards the Temple of Asclepius on a small island in the middle of the lake. The statues and fountains looked so alluring. We got so close that at one point we feared one of the fountains would draw us in and engulf our boat with water. We had to row a hasty retreat in laughter just before our time was called.RogerTrattoria Trapani on Piazza Giulio Cesare in Palermo reminded me of someone’s pantry. A young man and his father greeted us with smiles as large as mine and my mother’s hunger. To the left was the grandparents’ territory, the kitchen. We were given complimentary panelle (chickpea fritters), a local tradition. When we finished, the father came over and said, “I get you something from my farm.” He returned moments later with a complimentary plate of juicy blood orange slices. When paying I complimented the son’s English. He replied, “The Beatles. The best teachers, right?” Our no-frills Sicilian dream included plates of swordfish and spaghetti vongole for less than €7 a plate.Marth SnellingOne Saturday in June, we attended the annual Archidado Joust in Cortona. Attired in colourful medieval costumes, teams from Cortona, Arezzo and Subbiano perform elaborate flag-tossing routines, with cute displays by children, all accompanied by drummers and trumpeters. The celebration starts with a crossbow tournament, followed by a procession of worthies, drummers, trumpeters, and the teams into Cortona town square. For the next few hours, we witnessed a colourful and atmospheric pageant as each team performed with skill and precision. John HellinikakisWhile exploring the spectacular south coast of Sardinia, we detoured by ferry to the island of San Pietro, tempted by the annual Girotonno tuna fishing and cooking festival, held at the end of every May. The ferry docks in Carloforte, the picturesque main town. We soaked up the atmosphere, sampled tuna cooked a myriad of ways, watched tuna-themed cookery demonstrations, danced into the small hours at concerts in the main square, wandered its colourful streets and vowed to return.Marian O’Mahony"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691d191445cb8abe6f83c6379549662a3d237e94/0_253_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=cc6d756d454c9c877a9bcbd78339ac9e","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some resolutions for the future, we want to hear from youLiving in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life.

But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government’s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured – and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.First glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.\u0026nbspCloser inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.Twelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21 this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK’s excess deaths during the pandemic have passed 63,000 – higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) welcomes holidaymakers, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.Scientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government’s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.It is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be “a good outcome”.That milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government’s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.King has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to “turn the tide”, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.We have not “sent coronavirus packing”, King says, because the R factor – the rate of reproduction – is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.“There has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,” he said.His calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country’s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.\u0026nbsp“Cutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,” said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.Some modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington DC, for example, believes the UK could suffer another 3,500 Covid deaths by 4 August.Critics say the tide has not turned in other ways too. The government’s test, trace and isolate system remains “not even close” to being able to keep up with new infections, said King. Care homes complain about a continued lack of testing to control outbreaks which can spread through asymptomatic staff and residents.“We need much clearer protocols on planning for a second wave and they need to make their plans public,” said Martin Green, chief executive of the industry group Care England. “We need either weekly or fortnightly testing.”Care minister Helen Whately said on Tuesday she is expecting scientific advice soon on the appropriate frequency of repeat testing. Some care managers now want ministers to use hospitals to quarantine infected residents in future outbreaks, as happened in Hong Kong where no one has died from Covid-19 in a care home.“In any assessment of turning the tide you have to include preparedness and clarity of action against Covid,” said Dan Hayes, chief executive of the Order of St John Care Trust, which runs 82 care homes and accommodation centres where 242 residents died from Covid-19. “We still don’t have certainty about care residents being able to access hospital treatment on the same basis as everyone else. There is still a viewpoint that people in care homes will not benefit from treatment.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government’s “Protect the NHS” mantra had obscured other important aims.“The prime minister had all this rhetoric about turning tides, and taking things on the chin,” he said. “Twelve weeks later, we have one of the highest excess death rates in the world. And yes, the NHS has coped: but it’s coped on the back of discharging its patients into care homes cancelling operations delaying treatments for cancer – which probably means we’ll have waiting lists at 10m by Christmas.”Downing Street, by contrast, takes a very different view of its performance – and the outlook for the future.Referring to Covid-19 as “an invisible mugger”, Johnson claimed in the House of Commons on Wednesday that it had been an “astonishing achievement” to “drive down the curve”.Asked about whether the country had “turned the tide”, his spokesperson added: “Thanks to the very hard work of the British public we have now passed through the peak and you are seeing the key indicators like the new hospital admissions, new infections and the number of deaths falling. But at the same time we know we have much, much more to do in order to both beat this virus and put the country fully on the road to recovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f560196c8023f3d92f49ce9b007e838342e2713c/0_129_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6be9a9ac635cc4e02c663ed705bb6b04","title":"north korea decries stunted us ties after historic summit","story":"Pyongyang says since summit two years ago US has appeared friendly but has instead sought regime changeNorth Korea sees no future benefit in maintaining a relationship between its leader, Kim Jong-Un, and Donald Trump, the country’s state media has said on the two-year anniversary of the pair’s first summit.US policies prove Washington remains a long-term threat to the North Korean state and its people, foreign minister Ri Son Gwon said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.The Singapore summit in June 2018 represented the first time a sitting American president met with a North Korean leader, but the statement that came out of the meeting was light on specifics, opting instead for four general commitmentsRi said in retrospect the Trump administration appears to have been open to talks while seeking to isolate and suffocate North Korea, and threatening it with preemptive nuclear strikes and regime change.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“Never again will we provide the US chief executive with another package to be used for achievements without receiving any returns,” he said. “Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.”On Thursday North Korea criticised the US for commenting on inter-Korean affairs, and said Washington should stay quiet if it wants the upcoming presidential election to go smoothly.Ri said North Korea’s desire to open a new cooperative era runs deep as ever, but that the situation on the Korean peninsula is daily taking a turn for the worse.“The US professes to be an advocate for improved relations with the DPRK, but in fact, it is hell-bent on only exacerbating the situation,” he said.North Korea will continue to build up its military forces to cope with the threats from the US, Ri said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02f294d1645d557847f4c3beeab1f35411d4141/0_336_5533_3320/master/5533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74250c14fe07b43cfbf12e6e3111c686","title":"us caesar act sanctions and could devastate syrias flatlining economy","story":"Critics say legislation is being used for US strategy and could cause further problems for country and wider regionSyria seems barely able to absorb new shocks, but new US sanctions that take effect next week, could devastate what is left of its flatlining economy and amplify the gravest regional decline in decades.Known as the Caesar Act, the US legislation is a centrepiece of efforts by the anti-Assad opposition to deliver justice to the perpetrators of war crimes committed throughout the country’s nine-year conflict. But on the eve of its implementation, the new law is being interpreted as a catch-all for a broader push that aims to crush two of the regime’s main backers, Iran and Hezbollah.Five months before the US presidential election, efforts to curb Iran remain the dominant regional focus of Iran hawks in the Trump administration, who believe their policy of “maximum pressure” is fatally undermining Tehran and its networks, the most prominent of which – Hezbollah – holds a whip hand in the Lebanese government.But a string of crises partly fuelled by US strategy are adding to the burden of millions across the region: Lebanon is facing full-blown economic implosion and rousing civil unrest Iraq, meanwhile is combating low oil prices and crumbling revenues elsewhere.“In their rush to get Bashar and Khamenei, the US are forgetting who their friends are,” said one Lebanese minister. “Their ideological drive leaves them numb to the suffering of real people.”The Caesar bill was named after the pseudonym of a military photographer who smuggled 55,000 images out of Syria, showing torture in Assad’s prisons. Unlike earlier US and EU sanctions it targets the regime’s backers outside of Syria in banking, business and politics, expanding a remit to neighbouring capitals, the Gulf states and Europe, which have maintained economic links to Damascus. From 17 June, institutions, businesses or officials that finance the government of Bashar al-Assad could be subject to travel bans, denied access to capital, and face other measures including arrest.Ibrahim Olabi, a British barrister who founded the Syrian Legal Development Programme, an organisation that works on sanctions, said that even among some of the law’s proponents there are growing concerns that a “whatever it takes” approach could overshadow the intent of the law. He said earlier US and European Union sanctions had a more limited mandate.“The Caesar sanctions definitely have the potential to be a bigger deal because the US is using them to deter countries from doing business with Syria,” said Olabi. “The US has recognised that Syria is a proxy arena for all the elements they’re targeting.“Using the human rights abuses that were committed there as the vehicle helps give the US additional legal leverage for Caesar. Instead of Iranian and Hezbollah actors looking like they are being targeted on political grounds, they now could be targeted on the basis that they are supporting the unprecedented human rights abuses in Syria.”As the Syrian economy has unravelled since March, so too has Lebanon both countries’ currencies have plunged in parallel, and prices of essential goods are now beyond the reach of many. In Syria, protests against the imploding economy have been held this week in regime strongholds such as Latakia – a rarity throughout the war. And on Thursday, Assad fired the country’s prime minister, Imad Khamis, as pressure continues to grow from an increasingly desperate and vocal public.The ramifications of Caesar are rippling through Beirut, where traders retain lucrative ties to Syrian officials that are barely keeping Lebanese state revenues ticking over.Lebanon’s currency collapse appears to have factored in the upcoming Caesar bill and Beirut’s economic crisis is likely to have sent Syria’s economy into free fall. The parallel plunges are being used by some US officials to claim that both governments are co-dependent – and therefore warrant the same approach.Over the weekend, the US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey claimed that the crumbling Syrian currency was partly due to US actions.“The Syrian pound’s collapse proves that Russia and Iran are no longer able to float the Assad regime while the regime itself is no longer able to manage an effective economic policy, or launder money in Lebanese banks” Jeffrey said.Over the past month, wheat and fuel – subsidised from the fast dwindling reserves of Lebanon’s central bank – have kept the Syrian economy on life support, to the chagrin of some Lebanese leaders. Smuggling lines from Iraq, meanwhile, have maintained a supply of food into most parts of regime-held Syria, where soaring prices have led to few buyers.“My fear is that Caesar will achieve the exact opposite of its stated goals, fuelling the worst impulses of the Syrian regime and wider conflict. The US self-declared maximum pressure campaign aims to bring the regime to its knees and force its backers to concede defeat but the regime knows how to brutally hold onto power and it’s clear that its key backers aren’t for moving.“The Syrian people have been brutalised for a decade now and the country is devastated by conflict but we appear to be staring into the precipice of a dangerous new stage of the conflict … which risks a devastating new unravelling.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritageAgriculture Minister accuses Green party leader of doing a \u0026lsquodisservice\u0026rsquo to rural communities"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Ireland has “almost zero” new cases of Covid-19 and all indicators of the disease are either stable or declining, three weeks into the easing of restrictions, public-health officials have said.Vowing to “go as low as we possibly can” towards eliminating the disease, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said he did not believe there were hidden clusters “out there”, separate from the small number of daily cases now being reported.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) at its meeting on Thursday considered a call by a group of scientists for travel controls and other tough measures to be introduced short-term with the aim of “crushing the curve”.The group was satisfied additional measures were not needed, according to Dr Holohan.“We have almost zero cases occurring day by day. This is an effective strategy and integrates well with other countries in Europe with whom we want to increase our level of exchange and not decrease it.”IndicatorsAll indicators of the disease are stable or declining at present, Prof Nolan said.The reproduction number, a measure of how many people a confirmed case goes on to infect, stands at between 0.4 and 0.8. “The next two weeks are now critical in limiting transmission, keeping the R-number low and suppressing the virus,” he said.Meanwhile, the number of new cases per day has fallen to 14, from 50 the previous week. With the situation stable in residential care facilities and other at-risk settings, private houses are the new front line of the battle against Covid-19, officials indicated.They decided against changing existing recommendations on face coverings, though a communications campaign is to start next week encouraging the public to following the advice to use face coverings in indoor settings where social distancing is not possible.“Perhaps what we think is consistent advice hasn’t been heard as a clear and consistent message,” Dr Holohan admitted, while restating NPHET’s opposition to the mandatory wearing of face masks.The group will meet next Thursday to finalise advice to Government on the “rephasing” of the easing of restrictions. Its recommendations are expected to provide further clarity on a variety of issues, including a possible easing of the two-metre social-distancing rule, the reopening of hairdressers, rules around weddings and the reopening of the offshore islands.Asked what would be done in the event of a resurgence of cases, Dr Holohan said the same “blend of measures” would not be used. “We don’t need to do exactly the same things in the same way.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4276871.1591897427!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus is subdued but not gone this is a strange juncture","story":"Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health has said that compliance by the public in relation to use of face coverings is not where the HSE would like it to be.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIn pandemic terms, although it may not feel like it, these are the best of times.Gone are the horrors of the past few months: the gruesome death toll the sense that danger was lurking around every corner the unprecedented lockdown and other privations.Activities we previously took for granted – a visit to a clothes shop, a drive to the hills, the ping of a tennis ball – have about them the freshness of any new experience, after months of isolation and restrictions.We have been warned of possible dark days ahead, but for now, the threat posed by coronavirus is as low as it has been since early March.All of which places us in a strange position. We have been given new freedoms but are told to use them sparingly. More and more we are being told to wear masks, when at this point in time the threat from the virus is very low.Many are exhausted, yet there seems to be no end in sight. The consensus on the way forward that existed in March and April has broken down, inside and beyond the scientific community. Many experts promote mask-wearing others continue to doubt. Some scientists want to crush the curve, rather than simply flatten it. Ireland’s figures for coronavirus cases and deaths can look good or bad, depending on the prism through which they are viewed.The noise can be deafening, but some things are clear. We are doing pretty well just now, with new numbers of confirmed cases in low double figures each day since the start of the month. The rate at which the virus is being transmitted has stayed stable despite the lifting of restrictions.We do appear to be tantalisingly close to wiping out the virus for the moment, but then we are also close to wiping out our economy.We now have the capacity to test on a substantial scale, though we still do not have the necessary speed. To achieve that, we need to complete the process of automation and reduce the number of inidual steps involved.Contacts risingThe rise in the average number of contacts per case, from two to 3.5 since restrictions were lifted, is not unexpected as people start to move around more. It is also, given the low numbers at present, manageable.Contact tracing, too, needs to be speeded up. Many cases are closed out within a day but the handling of more complex health worker cases can take long periods. Contact tracing speeds may drop dramatically as international travel resumes and contacts need to be tracked down across international boundaries.Most of all, we need contingency planning for a rise in cases as society loosens up. How will we stop the virus getting back into nursing homes? How will we staff our hospitals and nursing homes next autumn and winter? How can we react quickly to specific outbreaks?The issue of masks has become isive and confusing, with the arguments for and against being expressed in ever more strident terms. Compared with handwashing and keeping your distance, mask-wearing seems to make a relatively minor contribution to limiting the spread of the virus however, it may prove sufficient to tip the balance in terms of controlling the spread of the outbreak.The reproduction number, the measure of how many people a confirmed case goes on to infect, will probably edge upwards as society opens up. The marginal value of masks may lie in helping to keep this value below one – meaning the outbreak declines – as opposed to rising above one, which would cause the outbreak to take off again.The biggest challenge will be to open up international travel without setting off another wave of infection. This is likely to take place gradually through “air bridges” joining countries with low case figures. Ireland is well placed now to be able to sign up to reciprocal deals with other parts of Europe where the virus has been largely suppressed, leading to a resumption of flights. Get this wrong, and we risk a fresh surge of cases later in the summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277315.1591939118!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"next two weeks critical in limiting spread of coronavirus says health official","story":"Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health has said that compliance by the public in relation to use of face coverings is not where the HSE would like it to be.

The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) briefing on Thursday was told the reproduction number, a measure of how many people a confirmed case goes on to infect, now stands at between 0.4 and 0.8.An R-number below one indicates the virus is being eliminated.“It is how we interact, as we go about our daily lives more freely, that will determine whether it increases,” Prof Nolan said. All indicators of the disease are stable or declining at present, Prof Nolan said.The number of new cases per day fell to 14 this week from 50 the previous week. The number of hospital inpatients with Covid-19 is 116, down from a mid-April high of 865, while ICU admissions stand at 34, compared to a peak of 144.The number of deaths each day last week averaged five, down from a peak of 33.The average number of tests done per day has fallen from 4,747 in mid-April to 2,547 now as the incidence of the virus has fallen.“We’re doing more than enough testing,” Prof Nolan said, adding that most cases now were isolated instances, or in households or families.Public health officials also said the wearing of face-covering in indoor settings is to remain optional. NPHET decided not to vary its advice on face-masks following a discussion at its meeting on Thursday, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said.Pressure has been growing for the wider andor compulsory wearing of face-masks to protect against the spread of Covid-19 in certain settings.However, the group decided to stick with its existing recommendation for the non-mandatory use of face-coverings in circumstances where social distancing is a challenge, such as shopping and public transport.Officials agreed to begin a communications campaign next week to encourage greater compliance with its advice on face-coverings.A further eight deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported by NPHET. This bring to 1,703 the total number of deaths in the Republic.NPHET also reported another eight new cases of the disease at its briefing on Thursday. This brings the total number of cases to 25,238.“NPHET has recommended the development and implementation of a national communications campaign to increase compliance with current recommendations on the use of face-coverings,” Dr Holohan said.“The campaign will outline best practice for use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations, where it may be difficult to maintain social distancing.” Officials recognised they would have to redouble their efforts to get across the message on face-coverings as compliance from the public was insufficient, he said. Retailers could play a role in promoting this guidance.“Perhaps what we think is consistent advice hasn’t been heard as a clear and consistent message,” he told the briefing, adding there had been a difference of opinion on masks here and in other countries.Many people commenting on the issue don’t have “the appropriate skills or knowledge base”, he added. While much higher usage of masks was needed, it would be inappropriate to make them mandatory given the evidence base and the difficulties some people have in wearing them.There are currently 88 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospital. Of these, 28 are in intensive care.An analysis of cases up to Tuesday shows 57 per cent are female and 43 per cent male.The median age of cases is 48 years and 3,307 (13 per cent) have been hospitalised.A total of 8,114 cases are associated with healthcare workers.There are currently 6,886 cases of the disease in 465 residential care facilities, where 1,073 deaths have occurred 251 nursing homes account for 5,310 of these cases and 940 of the deaths.Another 64 healthcare workers contracted the virus in the past week, bringing the total of such cases to 8,123.

Photograph:     Pavel GolovkinAPThe wife of a Dublin businessman barred from leaving China for 15 months has made a direct appeal to the Irish Government to intervene and push for his release.Tara O’Halloran said her husband Richard has been largely confined to a hotel since an exit ban was imposed on him, the first of its kind in China against an Irish citizen.Speaking publicly about her husband’s detention for the first time, Ms O’Halloran said he has been caught up in complicated events that pre-date his time in the aviation leasing company he works for. She fears for his physical and mental health, and the risks he faces during the coronavirus pandemic given that he suffers from a lung condition.AccusedMr O’Halloran has been blocked from leaving the country over an investigation into Chinese businessman Min Jiedong, owner of Dublin-based China International Aviation Leasing Service (CIALS), the firm the Irish man works for, concerning peer-to-peer lending and crowd-funding.The authorities have accused Mr Min of illegally collecting money from the Chinese public in a crowd-funding scheme and using it to buy an aircraft, currently leased to an airline in Europe.Mr O’Halloran, who joined the company a year after the events under investigation, travelled to China in February 2019 to meet investors and assess the problems facing the firm. After a week of meetings in Shanghai, he was detained at passport control at the airport as he tried to board his flight back to Dublin. He was later issued with an exit ban.The businessman, a relative of former Fine Gael taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, has testified as a witness four times in the prosecution of Mr Min. However, he has not been permitted to leave China despite both the prosecutor and Mr Min telling the court he should be.The Chinese authorities argue that Mr O’Halloran promised to transfer the aircraft and leasing revenues connected to the plane back to the Irish company’s Chinese parent but has not done so.“Under this circumstance, Mr O’Halloran is restricted from leaving China by law,” the Chinese embassy in Dublin said in a statement.The embassy said the Chinese police and court are “actively investigating and handling the case of CIALS in order to protect the property rights and interests of the victims involved in the case.“It is hoped that Mr O’Halloran co-operates positively with the local authorities in Shanghai to bring this case to a successful conclusion at an early date,” it said.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is being asked to do something he cannot do under Irish law. “It is not possible . . . it is entirely out of his hands.”Ms O’Halloran says he has co-operated with the authorities in China and that it was “a matter for the authorities to bring matters to a speedy conclusion and to allow Richard to return home to his family”.FrustratedAfter an initial meeting with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and contacts with his department, Ms O’Halloran says the family have had no further feedback.“So far they have just paid lip service. My children want their dad back,” she says.She has been frustrated seeing the department helping bring others home.“With the Covid-19 pandemic, I see them repatriating everybody else from all over the world to come back to Ireland to be safe, yet they can’t get Richard home. He needs their help.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: “We are aware of the case and are providing consular assistance. We do not comment on the details of inidual consular cases.”Ms O’Halloran said her husband missed the death of her mother in January, “nearly two lots of birthdays” and other important family occasions.His long absence has badly affected their four children, Ben (13), Amber (11), Isabella (eight) and Scarlett (six) who sleeps with a framed photo of her father.“It is very difficult for them to understand because we don’t know when he is coming home or even if, at this stage,” she says.Ms O’Halloran says her husband is permitted to leave his hotel but she fears the virus would “kill him” if he contracted it. He largely confines himself to his hotel room.“It has definitely taken a huge toll mentally and emotionally. It is horrific.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277335.1591946728!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"links to slave trade evident across ireland","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             A depiction of conditions on a slave ship\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Quite an entrance: Trinity College Dublin, built with money in the early 17th century from tobacco duty, a slave crop. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe entrance to Trinity College Dublin through the College Green front gate is one of Dublin’s best-known images. Few know it was built with money in the early 17th century from tobacco duty, a slave crop.Across the road the magnificent facade of what was once the Irish parliament, now a Bank of Ireland branch, was built with money from sugar duty, another crop raised by slaves in the British-owned West Indies. One of the founding subscribers to the present-day Bank of Ireland in 1782 was David La Touche. The La Touches were a Huguenot family who came to Ireland after fleeing religious persecution in their native France.They made a fortune in Dublin in the 17th century in cloth manufacturing and later in banking. David La Touche was the first to develop the St Stephen’s GreenAungier Street area.The family developed Marlay Park in south Dublin, founded Greystones and built Harristown Demesne in Co Kildare, which went on the market for €25 million four years ago.They were also slave owners, according to University College London legacies of British slave-ownership database. In 1833, after slavery was abolished across the British empire, the British compensated the slave owners and not the slaves, transferring huge sums of money to already wealthy people.According to British records, two members of the La Touche family received almost £7,000 (the equivalent of €1.1 million today) in compensation for the 385 slaves they owned in Jamaica.The family’s legacy lives on through La Touche House, a distinctive green-glass building that was one of the first buildings of the IFSC. In 1992 it was named after David La Touche by Bank of Ireland.Meanwhile, Westmoreland Street is named after John Fane, the 10th earl of Westmorland, who was a fierce defender of slavery and in the House of Lords in 1799 denounced attempts to end it.Clergymen involvedAccording to the University College London database, 107 people living in Ireland were compensated at the time for the losses they incurred after slavery was banned in the British empire. One hundred and eighty had Irish addresses.Among them was Howe Peter Browne, an ancestor of the Browne family that owned Westport House until 2017. As governor of Jamaica in the 1830s he was fiercely opposed to slavery and incurred the wrath of local slave owners, but it did not stop him claiming £5,526 for 286 slaves, worth about €850,000 today.Several Irish clergymen claimed compensation for slave ownership. Among them was Rev Richard Wynne of Drumcliff, Co Sligo, who claimed for the ownership of 30 slaves in the Virgin Islands. The amount he received is not listed.He was the grandfather of the Irish feminist, nationalist and socialist activist Dr Kathleen Lynn, the founder of St Ultan’s hospital.There are physical reminders of slavery elsewhere in Ireland. John Mitchel was an Irish patriot and writer best known for his Jail Journal. His hatred of British injustice did not extend to an aversion of slave ownership in the United States, where he lived out his days.Though not a slave owner, Mitchel was a fierce defender of slavery and a racist who described black people as “an innately inferior”. Two of his sons died fighting for the pro-slavery Confederacy side during the American civil war.A statue of Mitchel exists to this day in the centre of Newry, Co Down, where he was brought up.Tuam plaqueAttempts to remove a plaque of Confederate soldier Maj Richard Dowling from Tuam Town Hall failed in 2018. Dowling and his men foiled an invasion of Texas by 5,000 Union troops at Sabine Pass on September 8th, 1863, during the American civil war.Historian Damian Shiels, an authority on Irish involvement in that war, estimates that about 20,000 Irish fought with the Confederates.Mr Shiels says even those who fought on the Union side were not overtly concerned about the plight of enslaved African-Americans.“Fundamentally, no matter where the Irish were, they tended to have a very strongly held belief in their own white racial superiority, something they shared with the great majority of other whites at the time,” he says.“We are particularly poor as a nation at engaging with the history of our diaspora, both good and bad. Too often we focus only on specific stories that affirm our sense of selves as a people, or at the diaspora’s contribution to the ‘cause of Ireland.’ ”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277333.1591944875!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"enniscrone or inishcrone campaign intensifies to end confusion over name","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn old road sign in Enniscrone. The controversy is complicated further by a disagreement over Irish spellings of the Sligo town’s name between Inis Eiscir Abhainn and Inis CrabhannA 15-year campaign to allow locals determine the spelling of their seaside town is intensifying in the hope a new government will be formed and finally amend legislation to allow a plebiscite.Most residents and visitors know the Co Sligo town as Enniscrone, but official Ireland calls it Inishcrone, the name on the post office, the Garda station, the local authority offices and all official signage and signposts.The school however uses Enniscrone as do virtually all businesses in the area.Logainm.ie, the official placenames database of Ireland, under the remit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht gives a “no results found” response to Enniscrone, but offers Inishcrone or Inniscrone as alternative spellings.The controversy is complicated further by a disagreement over Irish spellings of the town’s name between Inis Eiscir Abhainn the name favoured by the local community group, and Inis Crabhann, the official spelling.Austin Tully of the local community council says “we want to take out the element of confusion”.The local community “is not trying to impose our view but to end the confusion” through a plebiscite.Historically both names have been used. Parish records dating back to 1825 always use Enniscrone to identify residence while the 1838 Ordnance Survey Office survey of Ireland refers to Inishcrone.“State recording of birth, marriage and death started around 1865. All these records use Enniscrone to identify place of residence,” Mr Tully adds.He points that the then village “had its first church dedicated in 1891 as reported in an article in the Sligo Champion at the time titled ‘The Dedication of Enniscrone New Church’”.Signposting used to refer to Enniscrone until around the late 1970s when the official Irish name took hold. Irritation became anger with the arrival of satellite navigation which only recognised the official name.Google Maps and other systems now recognise Enniscrone, but road signs still add to confusion.Sligo-Leitrim Fine Gael TD Frankie Feighan has raised the issue a number of times in the Dáil. “I’ve always said it’s like a turf war between two departments - heritage and local government.”They were close to a resolution and an agreement on the EnniscroneInishcrone row “but there was a bit of a difficulty with the Irish spelling as well. They could have gone with one plebiscite on the English spelling but they wanted to get the two of them together.”That requires review of the legislation allowing locals to vote and Minister of State for Local Government John Paul Phelan said he was awaiting a response from the Department of the Gaeltacht on a review of the legislation to allow the plebiscite to be put to the people.But a decision is not expected until a new government is in place.Mr Tully points out that it is a problem for many place names and in Co Sligo alone “Easkey, Ballysadare and Tobercurry, all have multiple spellings both on signposts and on addresses”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"There had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277328.1591945923!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brazil records more than 800 000 cases as india s infections soar","story":"Brazilians critical of their government\u0027s ambiguous response to a surging coronavirus pandemic dug 100 graves and stuck black crosses in the sand of Rio\u0027s Copacabana beach in a tribute to the nearly 40,000 people who have died so far.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesChina OUTMore than 7.5 million people have been reported infected with the novel coronavirus around the world and more than 421,400 have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Here are the latest updates on the pandemic from around the world: BrazilBrazil reported a cumulative total of 802,828 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, with 30,412 new infections in the last 24 hours in the world’s second worst outbreak after the United States. With another 1,239 fatalities, the death toll in Brazil has reached 40,919, the health ministry said, the world’s third highest after the United States and Britain. Of the total cases of Covid-19, 345,595 have recovered, the ministry said. On Thursday, Brazilian shoppers lined up for hours and crowded into malls as they reopened on Thursday in the country’s two largest cities. In Rio de Janeiro, malls opened a week earlier than planned as businesses starved of income pushed authorities to lift restrictions even as public health experts warned it was too early to avoid a resurgence of contagion. In Rio and Sao Paulo, shopping malls required masks and took people’s temperature. Shops limited access to 20 per cent of capacity and provided alcohol hand disinfectant for shoppers. Parking was also limited to 20 per cent of car spaces. Cinemas in the malls were not allowed to open yet and eateries in food plazas could only sell meals for delivery. President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the gravity of the virus and pushed local authorities to lift quarantine measures.India India’s coronavirus infections have surged to overtake the number of recorded cases in the UK, making it the world’s fourth-worst affected nation. India recorded 297,535 infections by Friday, compared to the UK’s 292,860 tally, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. After burgeoning infections in May and June, India now trails only the US, Brazil and Russia. Failure to ramp up testing and identify infection hotspots in spite of a stringent nationwide lockdown has cost the South Asian nation, which ranked 154 out of 195 countries in global healthcare access and quality even before the virus. The country with 50 per cent population below 25 years of age, has recorded higher recovery rates and lower deaths, ranking it below Canada, according to the Johns Hopkins University data. Fears of a sharper rise in daily infections increased after India eased its national lockdown on June 8th. The nation of 1.3 billion people has restarted inter-state flights and opened cities to buttress a sinking economy that has left businesses broken and impoverished millions.Covid-19 cases across the country, especially in large cities struggling with shortages of hospital beds and ventilators that include the financial nerve centre Mumbai and capital New Delhi, are expected to peak in July. The capital may need 80,000 additional beds to manage an expected surge of more than half a million infections by next month-end.US Coronavirus cases in the US increased by 22,317 on Thursday from the same time Wednesday to 2.01 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. The 1.1 per cent increase matched the daily average over the past seven days. Deaths rose 0.9 per cent to 113,407. New York will let five upstate regions resume indoor dining as infection rates remain low, while fewer New York City workers than expected returned to their jobs as the city began reopening. Florida said new coronavirus cases rose faster than the weekly average. About half a dozen states including Texas and Arizona are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds, fanning concerns that the reopening of the US economy may spark a second wave of infections. From apple packing houses in Washington state to farm workers in Florida and a California county known as “the world’s salad bowl,” outbreaks of the coronavirus are emerging at US fruit and vegetable farms and packing plants.Africa The spread of the coronavirus in Africa is accelerating, the World Health Organisation said, with total cases reaching 200,000 less than three weeks after the first 100,000, a milestone reached in 98 days. The continent accounts for less than 5 per cent of global cases. Deaths exceed 5,600, the WHO said. More than 70 per cent are in five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan. South Africa has a quarter of all fatalities, the WHO said. Germany In Germany, there were 169 new cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning, bringing the total to 186,691 according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That compares with almost 7,000 at the peak of the pandemic in late March. Fatalities increased by 20 to a total of 8,772. The daily death toll has remained well below 100 since mid-May. The reproduction factor of the virus, known as R-naught, was at 0.88 on Thursday, compared with 0.86 the day before, according to a daily report by the Robert Koch Institute. The government is trying to keep the figure below 1.0 to prevent exponential growth in the number of cases and a second wave of infections. The R-0 number represents the course of infection approximately one to two weeks ago and is sensitive to short-term changes, such as local outbreaks, especially if the number of new cases is relatively low, according to the health institute.UKThe government’s plan to distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) during the coronavirus pandemic was undermined because officials failed to stockpile gowns and visors despite warnings to do so, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has revealed. The report published on Friday by the National Audit Office (NAO) said this meant less than half of the expected pieces of certain equipment were handed out to frontline workers as the crisis developed. The only categories of PPE that increased in volume in the government’s stockpile between January 24th and February 21st, when ministers were acutely aware of the pandemic in China, were aprons and clinical waste bags. Health unions and senior MPs have been deeply concerned by the NAO findings, which also confirmed that 25,000 hospital patients were discharged to care homes at the height of the pandemic before testing became routine. About 300 UK health workers have so far died of Covid-19, and many NHS staff groups and families claim inadequate PPE played a key role in exposing them. On Thursday, the department of health said 41,279 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Wednesday, up by 151 from 41,128 the day before. The government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 52,000. China China has reported the first local coronavirus transmission in Beijing in weeks as the country’s capital gradually reopens due to a sharp decline in new cases. Six other new cases were Chinese citizens arriving from abroad, the National Health Commission said in its daily report. No new deaths were reported and 65 people remain in treatment, while another 104 are in isolation being monitored after having tested positive for the virus while showing no symptoms. One other person was listed as a suspected case after displaying other signs they may be infected. China has reported 4,634 deaths from Covid-19 — a figure that has been static for weeks — among 83,064 total cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese industrial city of Wuhan. Local authorities said the Beijing case is a 52-year-old man who went to a clinic with an intermittent fever but no other symptoms. He was swiftly diagnosed as having coronavirus, prompting authorities to isolate to family members and reinstate anti-virus measures in his neighbourhood. AustraliaAustralia has eliminated the novel coronavirus in many parts of the country, its chief medical officer said on Friday, clearing the way for sports fans to soon return to stadiums and for foreign students to prepare to fly back to classes. Australia recorded just 38 cases of the coronavirus over the past week, with travellers returning from overseas and already in quarantine accounting for more than half of them, said chief medical officer Brendan Murphy. “We have effectively achieved elimination at this time in many parts of the country,” Mr Murphy told reporters. Prime minister Scott Morrison last month announced a three-step plan to remove most lockdown measures by July. But with case numbers falling significantly, Mr Morrison said restrictions on indoor gatherings would be loosened in July with crowds of up 10,000 people allowed in seated stadiums and a trial scheme to allow foreign students to return. Details for students were being finalised but they would require quarantine, he said. The return of international students would be a boost for universities facing big financial losses with the border closed.ThailandThailand will lift a nationwide curfew and ease more restrictions next week, a spokesman for its coronavirus task force said on Friday, after the country has reported no local transmissions of the virus for 18 days. Thailand is also planning to reopen to foreign visitors by creating so-called travel bubbles with countries that have also managed to contain the virus, though no target date was set, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. “The curfew will be lifted effective on June 15 along with the easing of some activities,” Taweesin said, adding that strict social distancing rules still needed to be observed in all public activities. –PA, Reuters, , Bloomberg Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4276882.1591898594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"face masks highly effective against covid 19 new evidence suggests","story":"Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health has said that compliance by the public in relation to use of face coverings is not where the HSE would like it to be.

When masks were made compulsory in the German city of Jena, ‘the number of new infections fell almost to zero’, noted the report. Photograph: Sean GallupGetty ImagesThree new studies from Germany, Britain and the United States have indicated face masks are highly effective in stopping the spread of coronavirus from person to person.The first study examined the city of Jena in Germany, which made it compulsory for residents to wear face masks in public places, such as on public transport and while shopping, on April 6th.Scarves and improvised cloth coverings were allowed where purpose-made masks were not available, and medical-grade masks were reserved for health workers.\u0026nbspAfter the introduction of the mandatory masks, “the number of new infections fell almost to zero”, noted the report, which was written by four academics working in Germany and Denmark and published by an independent research body, the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).“We believe that the reduction in the growth rates of infections by 40 per cent to 60 per cent is our best estimate of the effects of face masks . . . We should also stress that 40 to 60 per cent might still be a lower bound,” they write.“The daily growth rates in the number of infections when face masks were introduced was around 2 to 3 per cent. These are very low growth rates compared to the early days of the epidemic in Germany, where daily growth rates also lay above 50 per cent. One might therefore conjecture that the effects might have been even greater if masks had been introduced earlier.”By the end of April, all of Germany’s federal states had made the wearing of face masks mandatory, following normal practice in several Asian countries that successfully contained the disease early on.Most effective measureA second study was conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and examined a coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt.It surveyed 382 people on the ship about what measures they had taken to protect themselves against the disease.\u0026nbspThe results indicated that wearing a face covering was the most effective measure against the virus, followed by distancing, and avoiding common areas. Of those who did not wear a face covering, 81 per cent became infected, while among those who did wear a face covering, 56 per cent became infected.Most studies stress that further research is needed to identify what kind of face covering is most effective, and note that a combination of hand-washing, distancing and other measures contribute to an overall reduction in spread alongside the wearing of face masks.The British study was conducted by scientists at Cambridge and Greenwich universities, and found that even home-made masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public.According to the results, routine wearing of masks by more than 50 per cent of the public means that people who are infected with Covid-19 pass it on to only one person or less.\u0026nbspThis means that the number of infections will drop over time rather than rising exponentially, as happens when no preventative measures are taken.The researchers found that if people wear face masks whether they have symptoms or not, it is twice as effective at curbing the spread of the disease than if people wear face coverings only after they begin experiencing symptoms.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Annexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4277012.1591943412!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk to abandon plan for full border checks in january","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier hinted that a compromise may be possible. Photograph: Daina Le LardicPoolGetty ImagesThe British government is to abandon its plan to introduce full border checks with the EU on January 1st as ministers come under mounting pressure from business not to compound the chaos caused by coronavirus.In a significant policy U-turn, Michael Gove, the UK cabinet office minister, has accepted that businesses cannot be expected to cope with Covid-19 and simultaneously face the prospect of disruption at the border at the end of the post-Brexit transition period.Instead of full checks, the British government will now introduce a temporary light-touch regime at UK ports such as Dover for incoming EU goods, even in a “no-deal” scenario.However, British officials concede that goods flowing to the EU from the UK are likely to face full checks as they enter France.The move, which is expected to be announced ahead of a drive to ramp up no-deal preparations this July, represents a shift from February when Mr Gove announced that goods coming from the EU would face the full range of checks. It will ease some Irish fears about delays in goods coming from continental markets through the UK to the Republic in the event of no trade deal being agreed between the EU and UK.The shift comes after the pharmaceutical industry warned the British government that the Covid-19 pandemic would prevent them from rebuilding the six-week medicine stockpile of 2019, raising fears in Whitehall of medicine shortages in the event of no-deal.Under the expected plans, agricultural goods will not be required to enter Border Inspection Posts in or near UK ports – as they do in Europe – and animal products may not immediately require health certificates. Only controlled goods will face immediate checks.The UK in turn hopes that the EU side will reciprocate by reintroducing the no-deal measures the European Commission had previously tabled on areas from aviation to trucking permits, but which have since lapsed.The change of tack will be welcomed by logistics and trade groups that have complained vociferously in recent months about the lack of information to enable them to prepare for new border controls.Trade negotiations The UK and the European Union will step up the pace of their trade negotiations following talks between British prime minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the deadlock over their future relationship.Mr Johnson will hold a call with Ms von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel and European Parliament president David Sassoli next Monday, according to a tweet from Mr Michel’s spokesman on Thursday. Five rounds of weekly trade negotiations will begin at the end of June. “This new process will involve a mix of formal negotiating rounds and smaller group meetings, both in London and Brussels assuming public health guidelines enable this,” a British government spokesman said on Thursday. The talks are a sign political leaders are preparing to inject momentum into the process after a fourth round of negotiations ended in stalemate last week. Mr Johnson had previously threatened to walk away from the talks in June if it was not clear that he was going to get an acceptable deal. The UK has repeatedly refused to extend the talks beyond the year-end, raising the risk of a chaotic parting with the bloc.The UK is resisting the EU’s demands over fishing and rules designed at ensuring a level competitive playing field between the two sides – two preconditions Brussels has put on any deal.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Rather, it is an attempt to meet the strictures of social distancing in a country struggling to cope with coronavirus.The authorities have given the go-ahead for cameras to roll again as India\u0027s lockdown is eased, and Bollywood executives have no doubt that film production will return to pre-virus levels within months.However, producers must follow an exhaustive list of rules, including a reduction in the number of crew members, social distancing on set and remote castings. Regular temperature checks will be taken on set by an on-site healthcare professional, with an ambulance made available at all times.But in one of the biggest – and for audiences most visible – changes, scenes involving close human contact will be cut, for the short term at least: bad news for fans of the legendary Bollywood group dance montage.Kissing – long a controversial subject in Bollywood films – will also be banned for the foreseeable future. Some have suggested using flower imagery, in a throwback to early Bollywood films, to demonstrate when a couple become intimate.For dance scenes, the new measures are expected to mean no big group montages because this would break social distancing rules. Instead, there is likely to be just the lead actor and actress, dancing separately and in turn without the usual 20 to 30 backing dancers.Even before the new guidance was announced, actor-producer Sanjay Suri said: Cinematic intimacy will take time to return. I can\u0027t imagine us sweating and close dancing in a film immediately. We surely will have to reinvent a working style and be cautious.In whatever form it does return, the reopening of India’s £2.4 billion industry, which usually produces more than 1,500 Hindi-language films every year – double the output of Hollywood – will come as a welcome relief to this movie-mad nation.Entertainment and films run through the lifeblood of our nation. The cultural connection between the industry and the psyche of our nation is extremely deep, and it has been that way for generations, explained Vikram Malhotra, the CEO of Abundantia Entertainment, a major Bollywood production house.These film stars see regular worship by their fans, much like they would worship goddesses, and there can be an elaborate ritual of prayers and celebrations that take place before the launching of a new show.Indeed, pre-lockdown, an incredible 15 million Indians visited the cinema daily – over one per cent of the entire population.When Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister, placed India under lockdown on March 25, production sets and cinemas shut as Indians were only permitted to leave their homes to purchase essential groceries and medicines.Bollywood has lost in excess of £100 million in box office sales alone.More than 500,000 daily wage labourers working in the industry – stitching exuberant outfits, designing dramatic set backdrops or working as runners for demanding stars – also lost their jobs.Despite pledges by production houses and film stars to cover wages, many labourers have been without any income for over two months.On Monday, when the government announced that private businesses were allowed to operate again, the government for the state of Maharashtra published a 16-page document detailing the rules that production houses would have to follow in order to reopen.Mr Malhotra welcomed the lengthy advice, arguing that it is necessary to protect the health of workers in a manner meaning their livelihoods could also be maintained.He aims to resume filming in July, once he can ensure that the new guidelines can be followed.Where shoots have started, the entire set is being sanitised on a regular basis, we are shooting with an optimum crew and the crew is using face shields, gloves, and other necessary safety equipment, said Punit Misra, the CEO of domestic broadcast business at Zee Entertainment Enterprises, another major Bollywood production house. Vidya Balan, an actress who was working on the blockbuster Sherni when filming was postponed, also welcomed the new regulations.This is probably going to be the new normal for a while, and besides doing the best we can to help each other out during these trying times, I\u0027m looking forward to embracing it and getting back to work and doing what I love, she said.Although cinemas will remain shut for now, the Multiplex Association of India has proposed a safe plan to reopen them from June 30.This will include the wearing of masks in the cinema, the use of e-tickets and seats between families being left empty.Even in lockdown, Bollywood has been plunged into controversy, with superstars like Priyanka Chopra and Disha Patani prompting an unusual public backlash after they spoke out against the killing of George Floyd by police in the United States.Indians responded on social media by questioning why the actresses had not condemned Islamophobic attacks their own country.Priyanka Chopra wants to end racism in the US, but is just fine with the blatant Islamophobic attacks in India, wrote one user.Whilst others were also quick to point out that both Ms. Chopra and Ms. Patani advertise skin fairness creams, these criticisms are unlikely to impact Indians\u0027 long-term love of cinema, and Mr Malhotra said it won\u0027t be long before cinemas are packed again.There is no doubt demand will return to 100 percent levels in a country like India, which is entertainment crazy, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"poole oxford seeing first stirrings silent majority","story":"Three cheers for the residents of Poole for protecting Baden-Powell’s statue by the harbour. And three more for my alma mater, Oriel College, Oxford, for so far refusing to give into protesters demanding Cecil Rhodes be toppled.At times, these last few days, law and order has seemed like an optional extra. Policemen bend the knee in front of a baying mob, get beaten up in the street, and run to escape pursuing crowds. Meanwhile, statues are toppled into rivers, war memorials are vandalised and our greatest ever war leader has “Racist” scrawled all over him.But is Britain’s sensible, silent majority now awakening from its slumber? Could it be that Poole and Oxford are the first signs of a great conservative fightback?It doesn’t come naturally to the silent majority of small-c conservatives to take on such a task. Above all else, conservatism is built on law and order, and respect for democracy. Yet, cowed by the mob and terrified of being labelled racist, politicians, public officials, and even some police officers now seem paralysed by indecision.So, we get the absurdity of the Bristol police standing by, so as not to “inflame tensions”, while crimes are committed in front of their very eyes. And we get William Gladstone’s name removed from a university building because of the sins of his father, for goodness sake.No doubt the extreme end of those protesting this week are thrilled by this. Just look what we can achieve when we intimidate people, they must think. Is there no end to what we can do when we bypass the ballot box and shout loudly enough?No wonder, then, that what started with a disgusting killing thousands of miles away in Minneapolis has led with lightning speed, via Colston, Gladstone and Milligan, to Little Britain and Ant and Dec. That’s the deranged logic of judging history by 21st century wonky wokeness. If Ant and Dec are fair game, then so is just about everyone living and breathing before about 2012. You might not know it from watching the BBC, but only 13 per cent of people, according to YouGov, approve of Colston’s statue being destroyed by crowd violence. Most are aghast at these self-appointed statue-topplers. By all means let’s have a sensible, democratic debate about statues, portraits, books and much more. If some need to be removed, then we can decide to do so calmly and democratically. But random mob demolition? He who shouts loudest gets his way? Think again.And let’s just ask ourselves what would happen if this all continues. Why, anyone with a grievance and a few loudmouthed mates would be free to take exactly the same route. If one group of protesters can destroy something they find offensive, the next group – perhaps with a genuinely racist agenda – will do exactly the same. That’s anarchy for you.And yet, our Conservative government is silent, seemingly choosing the path of least resistance. Fair enough, it wants to beat Starmer to the centre ground. But it can\u0027t afford to sit out this culture war. Its hard-fought 80-seat majority was built by attracting voters who agree with the people of Poole, are horrified by the vandalism of Churchill and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Oriel College’s desire for reasoned debate not knee-jerk capitulation.But if the government continues to dither, the silent majority must act for them. No doubt powerful forces will still put pressure on Poole and Oxford.Those battles aren’t yet won. But what matters is not the inidual skirmishes in what is now an all-out culture war, but the willingness of ordinary, decent people to stand up for common sense, democracy and debate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british families complain shut singapore lockdown","story":"British families based in Singapore have spoken of their despair at being locked out of the country indefinitely alongside other foreigners after draconian pandemic controls were suddenly imposed with little warning in March. Foreigners who live, work and pay taxes in Singapore have expressed frustration that their situation remains unresolved after the government announced plans last week to create a “fast lane” to expedite business travel from China. Hundreds of “employment pass” and long term visa holders are believed to have been shut out of Singapore when the country began lockdown procedures after a sudden spike in coronavirus cases. Their plight may be exacerbated by news on Thursday that foreign employees are expected to bear the brunt of some 200,000 redundancies predicted by economists by the end of the year due to an expected 7 per cent contraction of the economy. Several who contacted The  spoke of their mental distress at not knowing when they can return home, while some have already lost jobs and others have been separated indefinitely from their families. All asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation from the authorities. The recent announcement of a “green channel” to ease business travel between Singapore and China has been a particular source of angst, with some alleging discrimination against long-term residents who lived in Singapore for years and are vital to its economy. “This was a turning point that caused of lot of hurt and resentment. It was a really insensitive move by Singapore, even if it doesn’t work. They’re Ignoring people who are taxpayers,” said one Brit who was unable to return home after a short business trip. “We have been left hanging in the dark.”The impact on some families has been devastating. An American who runs his own business, employing local staff, said he had been stuck in another Southeast Asian country for three months, separated from his wife and young child, after leaving for a short work trip. “Life now is a struggle, trying to come up with enough business and income to keep paying salaries, rent on office, rent and living expenses for my family in Singapore, and now also rent and living costs for myself,” he said.About 1.7 million foreigners, including about one million from South Asia in low-paid jobs, live among Singapore’s 5.7 million population.Until March, Singapore was viewed a world leader in pandemic prevention by keeping its case load and death count low through ruthless testing and tracing strategies. The country’s success meant that many residents felt confident that they could leave for business or family reasons, or on vacation, and return home as normal. As of March 14, cases were still marginal and there were no travel warnings, but by March 15 the advice suddenly shifted to caution against all but essential travel. The border began to close, at first allowing people return and quarantine but swiftly escalating to a more draconian restriction that mandates government pre-approval before a resident on a long-term visit pass can board a plane home. On arrival they must quarantine in a government-approved facility. Inside the country, cases began to spike alarmingly as the government was caught off guard by the silent spread of the virus through foreign labourers who had been crammed into dormitories without the luxury of social distancing. In April, schools and businesses were closed as “circuit breaker” measures to stop the transmission of the disease although restrictions are now slowly being eased.  Many foreigners, however, are still struggling to get home. Requests are made to the ministry of manpower and there is no right to appeal. Many have complained about multiple rejections, with no transparency as to how decisions are made.EU, UK and other foreign governments have urged Singapore to find a quicker way to allow people to return but have so far made little headway.“At this moment, a timely return to Singapore remains unfortunately without guarantee,” the Swiss embassy warned in a letter in early June to its citizens.There are no public official statistics on how many people have been affected although one closed social media group dedicated to the issue has close to 5,000 members. One despairing British man who has been separated from his wife by the policy accused the Singaporean government of having “complete disregard to family values and the mental well-being of people due to long term separation.”He added: “This is clearly being demonstrated by the fact that they “forgot” about the 300,000 plus foreign workers in dormitories who work tirelessly to maintain and build this metropolis on their behalf.”The frustration, he told The , was that there was “no apparent policy, scoring mechanism or other way of knowing who gets priority… I fully appreciate that this situation is uncharted and extreme care has to be taken..but without a clear policy or feedback on why constant rejections are made is depressing.”A spokesperson for the British foreign office said: “We know there are a number of Brits and others who live and work in Singapore but are unable to return due to the current lockdown there. We are discussing this situation with the Singapore government and encouraging them to allow Employment Pass holders and their families to return soon.”Singapore’s trade and manpower ministries said they were aware that “some long-term pass holders are anxious to return..and understandably so” but they asked for patience as they restored connectivity in a calibrated manner “with safeguards to public health.”“Restrictions were imposed when returnees from UK  turned out to comprise a significant proportion of imported Covid-19 cases to Singapore, likely because community infection rates in the UK were high and rising sharply,” they said in a statement.“The measures taken by Singapore were also not unique and are similar to the travel and entry restrictions many other countries put in place,” they said, adding that existing restrictions would gradually be adjusted to “facilitate more returns by long-term pass holders in a safe manner.”“We will continue to give this our closest attention,” they said. “Singapore has always been open and connected to the world.”Another Brit, stranded with his young family in their March holiday destination said they faced an uncertain future after his wife had been made redundant. “You always live with that fear in the back of your mind that if you lose your job you’ve got 30 days to find another one or lose your home and all the roots that you’ve put down,” he said. “I guess this has been an eye-opener for a lot of expats about the plight of people who have less control over their own destiny than we do. It’s certainly been a strain but we’re trying to stay positive.”  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china annexes 60 square km india ladakh simmering tensions erupt","story":"China has occupied more than sixty square kilometres of Indian territory in eastern Ladakh, according to a senior Indian Army source, in a dramatic escalation of the simmering tension between the two Asian superpowers.The Daily  can reveal that up to 12,000 Chinese troops pushed over the border into India last month amid border clashes as Beijing looks to slap down Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his ever-closer relationship with the United States.The move echoes Xi Jinping\u0027s expansionism in the South China Sea where Beijing have moved to construct military bases in contested territory and has been unchallenged due to its superior military.The United Nations is calling for restraint, and wants talks between the two nations to any escalation of the conflict.Konchok Stanzin, a councillor from the Chushul constituency, where the incursion has taken place, told The : In the past, we have witnessed face-off between two armies and the situation would cool down within hours.It’s the first time we are seeing standoff for over a month. We are worried for our lives and our land.There have been reports this week of some de-escalation, but it is unclear whether this is rooted in on-the-ground movement, or is simply India trying to save face.Beijing and New Delhi have patrolled either side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which splits Chinese Tibet from Indian Ladakh since a ceasefire was agreed in 1962.Indian patrols in eastern Ladakh pause over winter and spring as heavy snowfall in the Himalayas makes terrain treacherous.But the coronavirus pandemic meant they were slow to reinforce this year and Chinese troops took advantage, crossing over the LAC on May 5 and 6 at four locations.A total of forty square kilometres were occupied at Pangong Tso and twenty square kilometres at Galwan River, with smaller incursions at Hot Springs and Demchok, a senior Indian Army source told the .Seventy Indian troops were injured in fist-fighting and stone-throwing as they tried to stop the advance.Weapons are not used when Chinese and Indian soldiers clash, as this is understood as a full declaration of war.India, which is admitting Chinese troops are present in sizeable numbers, is trying to use ongoing bilateral talks to persuade China to retreat from the areas it has occupied.But China is understood to have built defences at Pangong Tso and moved up to 12,000 troops to the new frontier, according to well-placed sources.India has also scaled up the presence of troops, transported artillery and Boforus guns to Ladakh.Confronting India along the border is Beijing’s way of putting New Delhi in its place – Chinese officials are unwilling to tolerate what they view as growing swagger from India, a strategic competitor and neighbour, under Mr. Modi.Lin Minwang, a Chinese foreign policy expert at Fudan University, said: “Modi\u0027s overall diplomacy has been inclined to ally with the US. China is actually very disappointed with India right now.”While Chinese officials have said little publicly, the foreign ministry is defending its actions as necessary and even restrained in response to provocation from India - language similar to how the government justifies territorial claims in the South China Sea.Tensions during the coronavirus pandemic haven’t helped.Kanti Prasad Bajpai, an expert on China-India relations and professor at the National University of Singapore, said: “India sent supplies to China and felt the Chinese weren’t very grateful – China publicly thanked countries for sending supplies, but never thanked India publicly.”  As the pandemic spread further afield, India – like other nations – had to scrap poor quality medical supplies purchased from China.Mr Bajpai said:“The Indians felt they were cheated by the Chinese. China rejected accusations that they had gypped the Indians. Around that, there was a bit of bad blood.”Mr Modi’s move to project himself as a bold leader both at home and abroad also puts him at odds with Mr Xi’s same tactic to fashion a strongman image.Experts say a full-scale war remains unlikely largely because of the operating challenges at high altitudes, with a lengthy de-escalation process as neither side will want to give the impression of caving.But until China and India finally agree on a border demarcation – which they’ve never been able to do – “the possibility of a border skirmish, limited border conflict, or full-fledged conventional war cannot be taken off the table,” said Monika Chansoria, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning news briefing real race debate","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here. For two-minute audio updates, try The Briefing - on podcasts, smart speakers and WhatsApp.After last weekend\u0027s scenes when peaceful Black Lives Matter protests turned ugly, fears are growing of fresh violence. A series of further rallies are planned, with far-Right groups organising counter-BLM demonstrations. Home Secretary Priti Patel - a staunch defender of the police - vowed that she will not be silenced after Labour MPs accused her of exploiting her Asian heritage to challenge the use of violence by protesters.

It means to manipulate a person using psychological trickery until they begin to question their own sanity.It’s funny, because I feel increasingly gaslit by the very generation that so rightly abhors this behaviour. Like the befuddled wife in Hamilton’s play, I am almost afraid to trust the evidence of my own senses. Things that once seemed, and still seem, self-evident facts have now been recast as faulty thinking, with no room for nuance or disagreement. Anyone who persists in clinging to wrong thoughts is ridiculed, threatened, berated and ostracised: a perfect template of the gaslighter’s art.JK Rowling has been subjected to this sort of treatment for years, ever since she absent-mindedly “liked” a sceptical Twitter post about gender identity. This marked her out as a wrong-thinker, and set off of a trickle of abuse that has since swollen to a flood. This week, in a long and nuanced blog, Rowling attempted to explain why she has become increasingly concerned about some of the doctrines of the trans-rights lobby, such as the demand for legal self-identification, the argument that lesbians who don’t want to have sex with people with penises are bigots, and the strange disappearance of the word “woman” from polite conversation. Rowling revealed some painful episodes from her own past to reinforce her argument. She had endured domestic abuse in her first marriage, she said, and suffered a serious sexual assault in her twenties. These experiences had convinced her of the need for female-only spaces.I don’t doubt Rowling’s sincerity, or her cunning: she knows that the only hope of getting through to the social justice brigade is to bare your own wounds. According to the rules of identity politics, your “lived experience” – especially the painful stuff – is what justifies your opinion. “My life has been shaped by being female,” Rowling tweeted this week, using her enemies’ tactics against them. “I do not believe it’s hateful to say so.”It didn’t work, of course. The generation that insists on the sanctity of inidual identity also demands complete conformity of thought and speech, on this and on many other matters. Anyone who questions the new orthodoxy, however politely, must be punished.Some of the Twitter responses to Rowling’s blog have made my hair stand on end: not just the torrent of obscene threats, but the wilful misinterpretation, the cod psychology, the belittling of an intelligent woman. I saw one blue-tick influencer urging people not to read the blog for themselves because it’s “a waste of time and an insult” another diagnosed Rowling with something called “internalised transphobia” yet another (a journalist for Pink News, for heaven’s sake), dismissed Rowling’s history of domestic violence as a “nonsensical pity party”.A school in west Sussex announced that it is dropping plans to name one of its houses after Rowling because she “may in fact no longer be an appropriate role model for pupils”. It’s so zeitgeisty it’s almost (but not) funny. Watching JK Rowling being pulled from her plinth by the excitable mob, I feel utterly estranged from my country. But that’s how gaslighting works, isn’t it? It’s not the world that’s going mad, dear: it’s you.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/25/11/adobe-project-aero-augmented-reality.jpg","title":"adobe photoshop camera iphone android download phone","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.There are over 80 filters available, including \u0027pop art,\u0027 \u0027dreamscape,\u0027 and \u0027sparkle\u0027Adobe has launched a free camera app for iPhone and Android users called Photoshop camera.Some of these filters are “pop art,” “dreamscape,” “sparkle”, and more.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn total, there are over 80 custom filters available in the app.It can also add real-time Photoshop effects such as auto-tuning to adjust brightness and contrast, and portrait controls.Quick fixes like portrait relighting and distortion removal mean you can post images that look like you spent way more time on them than you did” Adobe says.While the app can take photos and use Adobe’s Sensei AI to adjust them, it cannot record video.The app was announced in November at the company’s Adobe Max conference, and has been in public preview since.The aim of the app was to “bring the magic of Photoshop directly to your camera’s viewfinder,” according to Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis, speaking to The Verge.Adobe executive says augmented reality could be \u0027bigger than the web\u0027The company does not “see ourselves in competition with social apps or OS camera apps” but will try for partnerships to get its filters inside other apps or built-in to native camera applications.It will also be updated with influencer content at launch, Adobe has partnered with musician Billie Eilish for a custom filter.“You can imagine a world ... where there will be special purposed lenses directly monetized” around events or spaces, Parasnis said.Long term, the company hopes to introduce more people into its ecosystem through smaller apps.That is “working well,” Parasnis said, “and Photoshop Camera is the next one in that journey for us.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So history is something that needs to be challenged and re-interrogated and revised constantly”.She continued: “History has always excluded – primarily – women and people of colour and working class people and LGBTQ+ people in the ways in which it’s been told.”Glee star Samantha Ware says Lea Michele threatened to have her firedStormzy to donate £10m to black British causes over next decadeThe 45 films and TV shows in Netflix’s ‘Black Lives Matter’ collectionExplaining that a lot of people in Britain “don’t understand” the country’s colonial history, the author added: “Or they understand it through a certain prism where they feel that Britain went and travelled all over the world in order to help people. There is still a section of society who don’t think slavery was a really bad thing.”In removing the statue after years of trying to do so democratically, the country, according to Evaristo, had given “power to the people who really do object to a symbol of their historical slavery”.With Black Lives Matter protests taking place in the US, UK and across the globe following the death of George Floyd, Evaristo’s 2019 novel Girl, Woman, Other, which won last year’s Booker Prize, soared back up the charts this week, making her the first black woman to top the paperback fiction chart.Meanwhile, Reni Eddo Lodge’s 2017 book Why I’m No Longer Talking To White People About Race also made history this week, as Eddo-Lodge became the first black British author to top the paperback non-fiction chart.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEye care expert and oculoplastic surgeon Dr Sabrina Shah-Desai said: “It’s clear from the research how important sight is in terms of lifting people’s spirits.  “Eyesight and healthy eyes are often taken for granted, and that’s even despite the prevalence of sore and dry eyes – something which affects half the population.Does Covid-19 affect eyesight as Dominic Cummings described?Prince William says poor eyesight helped him overcome anxietyInside Politics: Dominic Cummings mocked over trip to ‘test eyesight’“While ‘lockdown eyes’ are a definite result of increased screen time, less natural light and even stress, there are lots of things we can do to ease discomfort and minimise potential longer-term damage.”The research also found the positive feeling from looking at a nice view can last almost five hours.As the world’s lockdown restrictions ease, the survey asked what participants would most like to see and found more than one-third of adults had a bucket list of places they wanted to visit.More than 25 per cent wanted to visit UK cities while 31 per cent said they would rather go abroad – with countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan being popular choices.  Two-fifths of adults vowed to visit more beaches in life and 42 per cent would like to see more if nature.It was found that people experienced an average of five “sights for sore eyes” during a typical week, but this had decreased by 20 per cent during lockdown.But more than half admitted they took nice sights for granted pre-lockdown, with 42 per cent actively looking for a positive image each day during isolation.The poll also found that the lockdown had resulted in 42 per cent looking at screens for longer than usual, which may explain why one-quarter had experienced an increase in tired eyes.Half of those polled, via OnePoll, even claimed to have experienced uncomfortable eyes every day.How to stop glasses fogging while wearing masks, according to scienceGovernment urged to protect those with sight loss during outbreakEye doctors suggest not wearing contact lenses to prevent coronavirusIt was also found that 52 per cent believed it was important for them to keep their eyes healthy, with 60 per cent getting regular eye tests, 58 per cent wearing their glasses when needed and 53 per cent ensuring they got enough sleep – all crucial to maintaining good eye health.However, one-quarter wanted to take better care of their eyes, with many admitting to some bad eye health habits – including almost two-thirds of womenMore than half of adults failed to take regular screen breaks while 58 per cent did not get enough natural light.Dr Shah-Desai added: “When concentrating on digital screens our blink rate decreases from eight clinks per minute to just one or two, leading to eye strain and dry eyes.“With 42 per cent of people experiencing a notable difference in their eye health since lockdown, including tiredness, soreness and dryness, it’s more important than ever to look after our eyes.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Headquarters in both countries will not be affected but the company’s legal base will switch to London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted that the decision was a “clear vote of confidence in the UK”.Unilever was forced into an embarrassing U-turn in 2018 after announcing plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam and ditch its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Nestle and Unilever ‘linked to Indonesian forest fires’Some shareholders objected to the proposals which were later ditched, with former chief executive, Paul Polman, and previous chair, Marijn Dekkers, both quitting soon after.After the new legal entity is established in the UK, Unilever plans to keep its main stock market listing in London with secondary listings in Amsterdam and New York. The company revealed it had not consulted Dutch shareholders about the plan, meaning there is a possibility they could block it, as British shareholders did in 2018.Its unusual dual structure emerged in 1930 after British soap manufacturer Lever Brothers merged with Dutch firm Margarine Unie to create Unilever.Establishing the new setup will simplify the business, with board members meeting in London rather than alternating between two headquarters in different countries.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Also please wash the mask (with the electronics removed) between uses,” he wrote in the Medium post.The LED housing can be cleaned using ultraviolet light.Glaiel said that he had been working the concept of the mask for a month, and thought about making the LEDs react differently for high-pitched sounds compared to low-pitched sounds.He got the feature working, but said that it “didn’t look good”.“I’m not planning on selling them so you’ll have to make your own,” he added.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These include new Spider-Man and Resident Evil sequels, a new Ratchet and Clank game subtitled “Rift Apart”, Gran Turismo 7, and Horizon Forbidden West (a sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn).The PlayStation 5 is not unique in having its design ridiculed.

Eight batches of Starlink satellites have been launched so far, with plans for them to eventually form a 12,000-strong constellation.Elon Musk says Mars-bound Starship spacecraft is now \u0027top priority\u0027In 2019, astrophysicist Dave Clements described the Starlink project as a tragedy for astronomy, claiming that the so-called megaconstellations of satellites would cause interference for both radio and optical telescopes.In response, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he was taking key steps to reduce their brightness, which are now being realised on the latest launch.SpaceX worked with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) to test different methods to address the issue. These included painting reflective surfaces black and using sun shades to block sunlight.The latest approach involves twisting the satellites during periods of their orbit when they are most reflective, so that only the knife-edge thin sides of the solar panels are visible.SpaceX told The Independent that it also worked with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NROA) and the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) to minimise the impact of the satellites.Despite these measures, there will still be times that the satellites are visible to the unaided eye and will continue to be noticeable at certain times in the first week following their launch.We\u0027ve taken an experimental and iterative approach to reducing the brightness of the Starlink satellites. Orbital brightness is an extremely difficult problem to tackle analytically, the firm said in a statement.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The Home Office has been pressing ahead with deportation flights despite warnings from the UN that they risk spreading coronavirus.The Independent has learned that a charter flight is set to depart the UK for Lithuania on Friday despite calls by the UN Network on Migration for all governments to suspend forced returns during the pandemic. The group warned the practice posed a risk to both deportees and the countries receiving them.Twenty-four removals from the UK took place between 20 March and 3 April alone, returning iniduals from Bulgaria, Romania, Hong Kong, Poland and the USA. The Home Office has declined to reveal the total number of deportations that have taken place during the lockdown.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe flight to Lithuania is due to depart with just one inidual on board, prompting concern that the Home Office is acting against public health and at a cost of thousands of pounds in taxpayers’ money. A previous freedom of information request revealed almost £12,000 per person was spent on charter flights last year.Home Office progress to protect vulnerable detainees ‘too slow’Man with coronavirus placed in immigration removal centreHundreds held for deportation despite travel banThe number of people in the UK’s immigration detention estate has fallen considerably since the lockdown started in March, but about 254 people are still being held. To place someone in detention, the Home Office must have a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale.In a statement published last month, the UN Network on Migration said: “Forced returns can intensify serious public health risks for everyone – migrants, public officials, health workers, social workers and both host and origin communities. Forced returns place additional strain on countries of return.”It warned that deportees may be at risk of experiencing “extreme financial hardship” and potentially human trafficking on return to their country of origin, due to already high levels of unemployment as a result of the pandemic.They may also face additional risks such as lack of access to adequate health care and poor water and sanitation systems, the UN said, adding that many health systems were already stretched and lacking capacity to protect returnees and their communities, including through testing upon arrival and quarantine and self-isolation measures.Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, which has legally challenged the Home Office’s continued detention and deportation of migrants during the pandemic, said: “Despite guidance from the UN and the government’s own public health advice against all but essential travel, the Home Office is desperately seeking to operate a forced removals policy throughout this pandemic regardless of the clear dangers.“Tomorrow Priti Patel has chartered a private plane to remove just one person to Lithuania, sacrificing common sense, public health and thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money. The humane and responsible response is to suspend all removals and release people safely from detention until this emergency has passed.”The Home Office has been contacted for comment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Headquarters in both countries will not be affected but the company’s legal base will switch to London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted that the decision was a “clear vote of confidence in the UK”.Unilever was forced into an embarrassing U-turn in 2018 after announcing plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam and ditch its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Nestle and Unilever ‘linked to Indonesian forest fires’Some shareholders objected to the proposals which were later ditched, with former chief executive, Paul Polman, and previous chair, Marijn Dekkers, both quitting soon after.After the new legal entity is established in the UK, Unilever plans to keep its main stock market listing in London with secondary listings in Amsterdam and New York.

Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis. Arizona alone has seen, on average, more than 1,000 new cases each day this week.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The number of people in extreme poverty around the world could rise beyond 1 billion as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, new analysis has suggested.Figures from the World Bank suggest that 736 million people currently live in destitution, surviving on less than $1.90 a day (£1.53).But in a study published on Friday, researchers at King’s College London and Australian National University have warned that the pandemic could trigger “substantial” poverty increases and reverse decades’ worth of progress.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDifferent scenarios of consumption and income contraction during lockdown were modelled to establish the economic shock of Covid-19 at three poverty levels – $1.90, $3.20 (£2.58) and $5.50 (£4.43) per day.The study found that an additional 395 million people across the world could be forced below the $1.90 line by the pandemic.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThis figure rises to 527 million people when considering the highest poverty classification of $5.50 a day. In this scenario, more than one-sixth of the world’s population would be living in some form of extreme poverty.These increases would mark the first absolute rise in the global poverty count since 1999, the study said, adding that the cost of the pandemic in lost income is estimated to reach $500m (£394m) per day for the world’s poorest people.“Millions of people live in a precarious position one shock away from poverty,” Andy Sumner, co-author of the study and an international development professor at King’s College London, told the The Independent. “The current crisis could be that shock that pushes them over the edge.”Dr Sumner warned that the distribution and location of global poverty could also shift away from sub-Saharan Africa towards developing and middle-income countries in south and east Asia, such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh.“The narrative for a few years has been poverty is becoming more and more about sub-saharan Africa,” he said. “But because there is a lot of people just above the poverty line in different parts of Asia, which has a lot of very populous countries, we could easily see a relocation of the overall picture of global poverty.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are:Creating a\u0026nbsprapid-response global commission on poverty and Covid-19 chaired by a G7 leader, a G20 leader and a G77 leader to discuss the poverty impacts and what financing is neededReleasing funds quickly by expanding the existing IMF debt servicing standstill to all developing countries and freezing World Bank debt repayments at least until the end of 2020Swiftly allocating the newly available funds into countries’ own cash transfer and other social safety programmes“The actual poverty impacts will be determined by what governments do to mitigate the damaging consequences of the pandemic,” he added. “The world’s poorest can’t wait until the G7 meet in September or the G20 meet in November.”Pointing to the example of the Asian financial crash of the late 1990s, which saw a number of government regimes reshaped and reformed in the aftermath, Dr Sumner said the sharp increases in poverty from Covid-19 could similarly “lead to major social upheaval of some kind” in the global south.The researchers also raised concern over the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine among the developing world, saying “there is no guarantee everyone would get it for free” while highlighting how it could reshape social lines.“Will we end up living in a new Covid-19 apartheid with the vaccinated and non-vaccinated residing in separate areas and working in different labour markets? While this might sound far off, already now there are some countries issuing ‘immunity passports’,” the paper says.Professor Kunal Sen, director of UNU-WIDER, described the new poverty estimates as “sobering”. “We cannot stand by and see the hard work and effort of so many be eradicated,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

More on our most recent blog post now.Christian Bs ex girlfriend, a -year-old barmaid from Berkshire, said he was driving a third car that police dont yet know about in mid-.The woman, who asks not to be named, moved to the Algarve town of Lagos in late  and worked at the Taberna de Lagos restaurant alongside Christian B, who was working as a waiter.Its hoped the revelation could help cops solve the case.The suspects ex has told the Mirror: #Towards the end of our relationship he had another car as well as the Jaguar.“I haven’t seen that mentioned anywhere. It was a Volkswagen. I don’t remember the model. It was a dirty, yellowy, mustardy kind of colour.“It was an old one and was long. I heard he still had it around the time Madeleine disappeared, along with the Jaguar.#Image: ReutersTheres a big development to report on the case this morning.The ex-girlfriend of the prime suspect, Christian B, says he had a secret third car in Portugal # and she believes it could hold vital evidence.Detectives are already looking into two vehicles owned by the suspect.But its now believed he also owned a Volkswagen estate at the time of Madeleines disappearance too. Detectives involved in the investigation of the case previously released photos of two vehicles linked with the suspect # a white camper van and black Jaguar. Madeleine McCanns grandmother Eileen, who never gave up hope that her granddaughter would be found, has died.Mrs McCann, , passed away from a coronavirus-related illness last month # weeks before German police revealed they believe little Madeleine is dead and they are now investigating a new prime suspect.Shortly after her granddaughter was snatched in , Mrs McCann # mum of Madeleines dad Gerry # said: #When I lost my husband two years ago, I thought that my world had collapsed.#But losing Madeleine is ten times worse.#Heres the full story.Christian B told an ex-lover he had “a horrible job” to do the night before Madeleine disappeared.The woman is one of two British former girlfriends of the child sex offender who were dating him while he was in Praia da Luz, Portugal, and have now given evidence to police.She has told of a chilling conversation she had with him over dinner on May ,  the night before Madeleine, three, was abducted.The then -year-old drter told her: #I have a job to do in Praia da Luz tomorrow. Its a horrible job but its something I have to do and it will change my le. You wont be seeing me for a while.#Christian B disappeared at the same time as Madeleine resurfacing three years later working in a bar in Lagos, around km from Praia da Luz.Christian B has refused to talk about Madeleines disappearance, his lawyer revealed earlier this week.He has remained tight-lipped in the high security German prison where he is doing seven years for rape and another jail term for drugs offences.But his lawyer Friedrich Fülscher suggested his client would deny the chargesGerman cops uncover enough evidence to prosecute him for Maddie’s murder.Mr Fülscher spoke after visiting Christian B at the prison in Kiel, northern Germany, where he is in isolation.When asked how his client was doing he replied: “How can a person, who is isolated in a prison and whom half the worlds population accuses of the worst crimes, be ”He said he would act “under civil or criminal law# against any  statements made against his client.And he added: #Christian B. is currently not providing any information on the matter and we ask for your understanding that we, as defence lawyers, are also not providing any information.#Madeleines grandmother Eileen “who never gave up hope” that she would be found has died from a Covid--related illness.Eileen McCann, , died last month weeks before German prosecutors revealed they believed the child was murdered while naming new suspect Christian B.Following Madeleines disappearance in , Gerry’s mother Eileen, from Glasgow, said: “As long as they don’t find her body, I’ll never give up hope. “When we do finally get her home she’ll have so much love and hugs from us all.”Thats all from us today, but heres a wrap up of the days main stories.GERMAN prosecutors investigating the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case has called on Sun readers to turn detective and solve the mystery.Hans Wolters is convinced rapist Christian B, , is responsible for her murder but is desperate for help from Brits who may hold the key to cracking the crime.Mr Wolters said they had “strong evidence” and added they were sure Madeleine “has been murdered” but still needed more information to make the case against him stick.He said: “We need the help of the readers of The Sun. Maybe there are some British tourists who spent their time between  and  in Portugal, in Praia da Luz, and took some video or pictures.“I hope there are some readers of The Sun who can help us to find the murderer of Madeleine McCann.“Many British tourists spend their holidays there and maybe they have pictures of the suspect or something interesting for our investigation.”The boss and former pal of Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B sensationally claimed #we all know# what happened to the missing tot.Tiziano Ilg hired the fellow German at his restaurant when the paedophile suddenly turned up in the remote village of Foral in the weeks following Maddies disappearance.Ilg, now in his late s and still living in the region, has kept a low profile since German police identied his old worker as a prime suspect in Maddies case.And its understood he has not spoken to police about his fellow countryman.But in  the former restaurateur claimed it was #time to stop looking# for three-year-old Madeleine, who disappeared some miles away from his Foral restaurant.Responding to an online news article about her disappearance, Ilg cryptically said: #Its time to stop looking and stop imagining.#We all know.#Full story below.\" title\"#Ex-boss of Madeleine McCann suspect sensationally claimed #we all know# what happened to the missing toddler# # The Sun\" src\"https:www.thesun news  madeleine-mccan-suspect-boss-knew-claim embed # secretEriEkMmEPm\" data-secret\"EriEkMmEPm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Top detective Dave Edgar has said there is a #huge way to go from Christian B being named as a suspect to him being prosecuted.He told The Sun: #Secondly, this case is still without a body. And without a body, there is no evidence Madeleine was murdered,# he said.“Without a body, there is still a great deal of hope for the McCanns their daughter is still alive.#His claims contradict those of German prosecutors who say there is enough proof to convince them Madeleine was killed after being abducted.However, the retired detective said there is still no “hard evidence” the youngster has actually been killed.The step-dad of a girl who vanished near where Madeleine McCann was taken has urged police to quiz Christian B about her disappearance.Joana Cipriano was eight when she went missing from Figueira, just five miles from Praia da Luz, in .Step-dad Leandro Silva has called on German and Portuguese police to investigate any links between Madeleine’s suspect and Joana.The young girl’s mum, Leonor Cipriano, and uncle, Joao Cipriano, were convicted of murdering the eight-year-old, although her body has never been found.The pair served nearly two decades in jail, but Mr Silva still claims that they are innocent.Madeleine McCann vanished from her family’s holiday apartment in Portugal in  where she was sleeping alongside her twin siblings Sean and Amelie.Now aged , the twins have grown up without knowing their older sister who is still missing.Sean and Amelie live with parents Kate and Gerry at their home in the town of Loughborough in Leicestershire.They attend a Catholic secondary school the area which retains a place for their sister Madeleine, who would be aged  now,she is ever found.The twins are both aspiring athletes and have competed in triathlons and country crossing racing.Sean and Amelie were aged only two at the time of their sister’s disappearance on May , .Former GP Kate, now a medical worker, said her twins have “grown up essentially without Madeleine but knowing their sister is missing and they want her back.”Heres a summary of all the latest updates today.Portuguese prosecutors have confirmed Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B served two jail sentences in the country.It was reported last week that the -year-old had served time in Portugal, but authorities have now revealed his criminal record.Last night prosecutors took the unusual step of confirming Christian B had been convicted of “disobedience” and “theft”.A spokesman for the Faro District of the Portuguese Public Prosecution Service said: “The Maddie suspect was convicted of disobedience in one case and of theft in another.“Five requests for international judicial cooperation were also found in which the name of the suspect is mentioned.“One of the requests is related to a case actioned against unknown people and closed in February , and four related to the investigation into Madeleine McCann’s disappearance.”Local media had reported that the -year-old spent two months in Evora Prison, in central Portugal, and nine months in jail in the Algarve for petrol theft in .Prime suspect Christian B broke into his British ex’s flat sparking chilling echoes of the Madeleine McCann case, according to reports.The convicted sex fiend was so insanely jealous he hid under the woman’s bed in case she brought another man home.His ex, from Berkshire, moved to the Algarve town of Lagos in late  and worked at the Taberna de Lagos restaurant alongside waiter Christian B, who was two years younger.The -year-old barmaid # who has asked not to be identied # came home alone and was horried when he appeared under her bed before coolly walking away.She was left traumatised by the incident, three years before three-year-old Maddie was snatched from her holiday home in Praia da Luz on Portugal’s Algarve.Recalling the incident, she told the Daily Mirror: #I peeked under and got the shock of my le. He was hiding under there, lying on his back, staring at me.“He got out from under the bed, acted like everything was normal, said goodbye to me, walked out and closed the door behind him.“I was there all alone, just shaking and shaking.”A barmaid has recalled the moment Christian B shouted at her #the child is dead# when colleagues discussed Madeleine McCanns disappearance.The suspect is said to have got #very aggressive, nervous and agitated# as workers at a kiosk he ran in his hometown of Braunschweig brought up the toddler.Chief suspect Christian B is said to have boasted about torture and destroying evidence in an online conversation with another paedophile.He made chilling threats about wanting to “catch something little and use it for days”.German cops investigating the disappearance of Inga Gehricke, five, – which Christian B has also been linked to – discovered the conversation.During the chat, when Christian B was asked about being caught, he reportedly said: “Meh,the evidence is destroyed . . .”He then added: “Then I’ll record maaaany videos clips. I’ll document in detail how she’s being tortured.”Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B had a #hair trigger temper# and threatened a pal with a kne, a German documentary revealed last night.Former pal Norbert M spoke of the -year-olds temper on the RTL two-hour special.He said: #In , I took over a kiosk that had previously been run by him.“He wanted to take a freezer and the air conditioning with him, even though they didnt belong to him. He was very aggressive.#A short time later he showed up here with some acquaintances. One of them threatened me with a kne.“This was a shock. As a neighbour, I used to shopping with him. My experience was that he was quite friendly.#But that could change. He blew hit and cold.#Ex private detective Dave Edgar has said it would be dficult to pin anything on Christian B as so much time has passed since the disappearance.“If it wasn’t detected in the first year then it’s going to be very dficult to detect after that, unless you’ve got some sort of hard evidence – i.e. – forensic evidence or identications that are going to stand up,# he warned.“Andyou haven’t got that sort of evidence to build a case from  years down the line, it’s going to be very dficult to do. That’s an understatement – it’s going to be damned hard.#Top detective Dave Edgar said the identication of the new prime suspect Christian B brought back chilling memories of his probe into a British sex fiend.Raymond Hewlett was once believed to hold the key to the missing childs disappearance.During his hunt for the little girl, Edgar probed now-dead paedophile Raymond Hewlett’s apparent links to Madeleine’s disappearance.Like the new suspect, Hewlett lived in a battered camper-van in the Praia da Luz area and had committed a string of sexual offences against young girls.Hewlett, , was living just an hour’s drive from where Madeleine disappeared in the Algarve in May .But he died in  of throat cancer after spending years refusing to talk about the theory.The detective said: “Hewlett was definitely a person of interest to us. He was someone capable of abducting a child as he had the background and profile to interfere with children.“I tried my best to speak to him, but he wouldn’t speak. But there was just no evidence to link him to the case beyond his background – absolutely no evidence.“Yes, he was someone we were interested in, but in terms of real evidence, there wasn’t any, unless the Portuguese are sitting on some that I don’t know about.”Former cop Dave Edgar, speaking to The Sun, added that now is #not a time for knee-jerk reactions#.He said: #It’s time to just put the brakes on the speculation, and step back. It’s not a time for knee-jerk reactions.#The expert added he does not believe the lack of a body fits the profile of a kidnapping by a stranger.“In my experience, when strangers kill children, orstrangers kill anyone for that matter, they do one thing very quickly and they do it almost automatically – they dump the body of their victim so they’re not caught with it,# he revealed.“That’s just the way it works.#Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right. So the only travellers affected by this ludicrous policy will be the law-abiding and public figures who risk being spotted on holiday then named and shamedthey don’t self-isolate upon .Everyone  can just give their details as Mickey Mouse of Taking The Mickey Street, and go about their le with impunity.Meanwhile, the airline industry is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy because it sends out the message that Britain is closed.Well. Done. Everyone.Prince Albert of Monaco has a problem – his subjects are getting too old.According to the BBC documentary Inside Monaco, it’s the most elderly country on Earth.So the principality has launched an “influencer” award aimed at attracting a younger “YouTube” generation who,the footage of their garish supercars is anything to go by, have money but zero taste.The awards are the brainchild of the prince’s friend . . .  . . .  Princess Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duchess of Castro If Little Britain ever doesto our screens, she’s a shoo-in.Dancing On Ice is reportedly considering filming the show with two-metre social-distancing measures in place.If the rumours of their big fallout are true, last series contestant Caprice and her dance partner Hamish Gaman would have had no trouble with implementing it.Pixar’s animated movie Coco has been voted the most tear-jerking film of all time, with Marley  Me in second place and Schindler’s List in third.It was the result of a Twitter survey by US film critic Kevin Lee, who asked followers to tell him “the hardest you’ve ever cried in a movie TV show”.I haven’t seen Coco, but my weepiest, cinematic experience didn’t make the top ten.It’s Mask – starring Cher and Eric Stolz – a film that rendered me so inconsolable that the man in front of me askedI could “shut the hell up”.And Goodbye Mr Chips wasn’t far behind either – but at least I was home on the sofa for that one.Other than Leonardo DiCaprio browsing for a new girlfriend, who actually shops at underwear store Victoria’s Secret any more Not many Brits, it seems – its  UK stores have just gone in to administration.Back in the day, VS underwear was tasteful and good quality, but somewhere along the way it lost sight of its core customer.The owners clearly forgot that, while men lusted after the scantily-clad “Angels” such as Alessandra Ambrosio at its catwalk shows , it’s primarily women who buy lingerie.And the majority want “tastefully boudoir” not “garishly bordello”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In stem cell therapy, cells are taken from either bone marrow or the patients own heart and injected into other parts of the body in order to repair damaged tissue.Schumacher, who won a record seven F world championships with Benetton and Ferrari, underwent his first stem-cell therapy in Paris in September last year.French journalist Jean-Michel Décugis told The Times that the stem cell therapy will have an anti-inflammatory effect which will mostly likely impact the brain. He said: Our sources say that Michael Schumacher is receiving stem cell perfusions that... produce a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.That is to say they reach the whole body and you could imagine that they reach Michael Schumachers brain.Its quite mysterious. Officially [Menasché] works only on the heart.Stem cell therapy - also known as regenerative medicine - promotes the repair of diseased, injured and dysal tissues.Stem cells are the bodys raw materials - the cells from which all specialised cells, like brain or heart cells, are generated.Under lab conditions stem cells can ide to create daughter cells.These daughter cells can form new specialised cells with a specic- brain, heart muscle, blood or bone cells.The pioneering treatment is still relatively new and many studies are examining its potential.In Michael Schumachers case its understood doctors are aiming to use the treatment to regenerate his nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.It could involve scientists taking stem cells from the Formula One legends bone marrow, to create new brain and spinal cord cells with an aim of treating those that were injured in his accidentHe is carrying out experiments with [secretome] that is made by a laboratory from new stem cells and injected into veins, until now only on animals.Mr Décugis also claims that Schumacher is being injected with secretome -protein found in the human body - which he says Menasche calls stem cell juice.In October, Menasche warned fans that he does not work miracles following the first widely-reported stem cell therapy on the sports star.He also slammed claims he was carrying out experiments on the legendary racing driver.Speaking with Italian newspaper La Republica, he said: I do not perform miracles.My team and I are not doing an experiment, an abominable term that is not in line with a serious medical view.And after the procedure last year, a nurse told Le Parisien that Schumacher was conscious.She said: Yes he is in my service ... And I can assure you that he is conscious.Speaking about the cutting-edge procedure, Acciari said: Over the past  years, science has made enormous progress with stem cell treatment.But that does not change that we still do not know much about the human brain.We are not able to say what the results will be.In January, Italian brain surgeon Nicola Acciari - who has not reportedly treated the German - claims he will still be changed from the man his millions of fans remember.We must imagine a person very dferent from the one we remember on the track, with a very altered and deteriorated organic, muscular and skeletal structure, said Acciari.All as a result of the brain trauma he suffered, he told Italian newspaper Contro Copertina.Last month, former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa said he is very close to Schumacher and said his situation is not easy.He told Fox Brazil: I know how heis, I have information. My relationship with him has always been very close.It is less close with his we Corinna because she did not go to many races. But I think the main thing about all this is that we know that his situation is not easy. He is in a dficult phase but we need to respect him and the family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a colourful person and I even have pink hair. I like it more and more as I get older, she said.“I made this house around my own le and I wasn’t thinking about it being sellable.“We’re living like two children in a doll’s house and in retrospect why would anybody  want to buy it “I just thought it might go to a mad collector of my work who might want to buy it, but no one was interested.Ms Young said she enjoyed transforming the property from two rundown cottages into a colourful playhouse for adults. “It became a really fun project for me on the side of my pottery business and I was so galvanised by it I ended up neglecting my pottery at times.“I painted it all myself and I would get help for some bitsI was in a hurry and was trying to work on the pottery. When you do it by yourself, you do it with all your heart.“I’ve stopped noticing how colourful it is because I’ve lived here for so long.“Lots of people are self-conscious and don’t say much when they see the decoration, but the right reaction is to laugh and go ‘oh wow.’“It should make you feel like a child walking into a sweet shop.

It is a big decision the Government has got to make and make it now.Today No said that the Nightingale hospitals would be kept for the meantime, amid fears of a renewed wave of the virus over the winer.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said the hospitals remained an important surge capacity.We may still need Nightingale hospitals for the months ahead. We will maintain that extra capacity until such time as there is more certainty, the spokesman added.Yesterday, Government scientists revealed their fears of a deadly second wave in the winter which could throw a spanner in the works to kids education and the wider recovery,Sir Patrick said last night that scientists were looking carefully at how lockdown was managed should this happen again in the winter.Professor Whitty said: We have to accept that we could find ourselves in one of three situations.One is where we have a situation wherestarts to escape control.The aim is that wevery slowly to prevent that from happening but thats the risk.The second situation isand we all think there is a a reasonable chance that in the winter this virus will have some advantages it doesnt have the rest of the year.Its something that transmits more easily indoors.Therefore, things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter.The nature of new epidemics is very often they come in waves, circling around the world andwe get hit by another wave.At that point we need to understand better what is the optimal mix of things we can do.One of the Governments key tests for lting lockdown is ensuring the NHS will be able to cope - but as the nights start to draw in and more people fall ill with regular winter viruses, the health service could start to falter again.Today No said again that the threat level for the virus had not reduced down from four to three as was predicted.Some moves to ease the lockdown have been made - such as reopening schools for some pupils and plans to open shops next week - but that is because Boris Johnson has ensured the five tests have been met. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Speaking to news.au, Professor Robyn Young of Flinders University said: “His autism meant he was at risk because he wasn’t responding by name and he was upset by helicopters flying overhead.But at the same time there were a number of things that were protecting him.“Much of them relate to hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity – basically they have a high pain threshold.“We’re not surethey don’t feel it or don’t respond to it but I’ve seen kids that have walked around with broken bones.”She added that William probably didnt feel the cold as much as another child would have. As part of the hunt, emergency responders played the theme tune from Thomas the Tank Engine, Williams favourite TV show, over a PA system. He was eventually found by volunteer Ben Gibbs almost  hours after last being seen.I was wandering through the bush, and it was quite thick so I was breaking my way through it, said Gibbs. And then he was just about  meters from me standing there, just really angelic.Speaking to local media shortly after the discovery, Penny Callaghan said: Im obviously immensely relieved.

But the body language is always revealing.”Here, CLEMMIE FIELDSEND takes a look at the stars’ poses as Judi reveals what they mean.Judi says: “Amanda’s sexy, one-hunched-shoulder, trophy bottle look shows she doesn’t take her own glamour too seriously.It’s comedy cheese, which is Amanda’s attempt at looking flirty while showing she is also smart and a little self-effacing.”Judi says: “This armpit-baring display is usually seen on alpha males in the boardroom. It suggests assertiveness and a desire to be seen as confident.It’s got a pin-up vibe but also hints Leigh-Anne takes no nonsense.”Judi says: “Liz is keen to look as though le is one long, exciting ball. By keeping the arms slightly open she’s encouraging us to join in.It’s the pose of an attention-seeker, who everyone wants to be with but who eclipses everyone  with their fabulousness.”Judi says: “Kelly’s pose suggests that she now prefers to be seen as a shrewd, contemplative thinker.The finger to her forehead is an unsubtle arrow to her brain and the finger on the mouth is linked to decision making.”Judi says: “Rita poses in all sorts of body contortions, suggesting a desire to be seen as a very inidual artist.Looking down into the camera like a curious child, she’s showing a more infantile approach to le, but ultimately wants to appear sexy.”Judi says: “The idea here seems to be that the leg has a le of its own. It tells us she’s supple, fit, sexual and attention-seeking.For a woman known for being elegant yet serious, this leg splay suggests there’s a more fun side to Posh.”Judi says: “Her bum is the main focus and I love the way she allows this sexual signaller to flirt away with confidence while she peeps demurely over one shoulder.It suggests two sides to her personality – the naughty extrovert and the more coy, polite Emily.”Judi says: “With her tilted head and tumbling hair, Beyonce looks elusive, unobtainable and very intense.The constant emphasis on her hair and not her beautul face – which Beyonce often covers with shades – could hint at a less self-assured side.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You cannot ‘socialise’ at two-metre distances and this would be impossible to manage.“If people come out and have a poor social experience, whether in bars, restaurants or clubs, then they will limit or eradicate their visits in future.”The latest figures reveal beer sales fell to their lowest level on record even before lockdown because punters were being scared away from pubs.The Federation of Small Businesses says time is running out and urged Mr Johnson to follow international counterparts.Boss Mike Cherry said: “Many in the hospitality and leisure sectors simply won’t be able to turn a profitthe blanket two-metre rule remains in place.“Small businesses across some European countries have benefitted from a shortening of this distancing benchmark as part of unlocking processes.“If the UK experts say a similar move is possible here, then we need to see that change enacted. Time is of the essence during these critical summer months.”Greg Clark, head of the Commons Science Committee, said the Government’s “unquestioned default” of two metres was called into question by more countries going for the one-metre margin.The former Business Secretary said: “We should be using our knowledge to constantly question whether this is right and have the courage to be able to changethe evidence recommends that.”Many countries have adopted the one-metre World Health Organisation recommendation.Germany operates . metres and risk-averse Japan at . metres. It makes the UK one of the most cautious countries.The PM has said the number of coronavirus cases was still too high to reduce social distancing.  Ministers warned last night that millions of children might notto school until next year unless distance rules are eased.Earlier this week, the Government dropped plans for all primary school children to go back for a month before the summer.And the PM has said September is now only his “ambition” because the number of infections is still too high to increase maximum class sizes of , or to relax the two-metre rule.Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has warned that a winter spike in coronavirus cases could trigger a second lockdown.This has sparked fears that the Government’s scientic advisory body SAGE will not change its advice on social distancing in schools before the winter.And that will make it impossible for schools to operate anywhere near full capacity.One government insider saidSAGE were so cautious going into summer they would not want to be playing “fast and loose” with the “R” infection rate heading into winter.Boss of the Commons Education committee Robert Halfon told The Sun: “There’s always going to be a reason not to open schools but we have to get our kids learning again. People may be worried about a second wave butschools don’t open in September, we will have an ice age in terms of children’s learning.”Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Johnson should have the courage to make the “big decision”.He told The Sun: “Unless you get this down to one metre, you’ll not get schools back because they can’t work at two metres.“Public transport doesn’t work, businesses can’t work, the hospitality sector won’t work.“At the apex of every strategic decision lies two metres. You cannot get people back to school or work unless we change the rule.” Infectious disease expert Professor Mark Woolhouse said the PM was being too cautious and claimed that it was “fine” to reduce social distancing.He said the PM must not let the two-metre rule become “set in stone” and urged him to listen to the latest scientic evidence.He said: “I understand the reasons for caution and I completely respect it but I think as the evidence accumulates those reasons become less convincing.“What I’m hearing is going down to one metre would make a very, very big dference to large parts of the economy and to education as well as for schools. It’s easy to see why. So what government has to do, based on the evidence available, is to say, ‘Well, is that increased risk, however slight, worth taking ’“Government is being in my view very, very cautious.“What I’d like to see is a continual willingness to reappraise decisions about lockdown based on accumulating evidence.“This is a new virus, we’re all understanding it better, almost literally day by day.“So we have to be responsive to the changes in evidence andwe do that I expect we’ll find, as many countries around the world have, that one metre is fine.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now its time to focus on the second row of squares.Rotate the cubes top layer until an upside-down T of all one color forms - make sure there isnt a yellow square in the middle of the bottom row on the top face. The color of this square will correspond with either the right or left face of the cube.If the square corresponds with the right face, rotate the top clockwise by performing a right trick.If the square correlates to the left face, rotate the top face counterclockwise and perform a left trick.Youll have moved around a white square while doing a trick - replace the white square in the same way we did in Step , and repeat this until the second row of the cube is complete.Create a yellow cross on the top of the cube by moving the front face clockwise, the top face clockwise, then the right face clockwise.Next, turn the top face counterclockwise, right face counterclockwise, and then the front face counterclockwise.The next step is to align the middle square colors of the top layer in the correct position.Three of the top layer colors will move counterclockwise, while the colored square that will stay in place is the color facing you.Turn the right face clockwise, top face clockwise, right face counterclockwise, top face clockwise, and right face clockwise.Then, turn the top face clockwise twice before turning the right face counterclockwise.Youre almost done! But first, youll have to make sure the corners are in the right place.For this next move, all of the corners will move away from the corner closest to your left.Turn the right face clockwise, top face counterclockwise, left face clockwise, and the top face clockwise.After that, turn the right face counterclockwise, the top face counterclockwise, and the left face clockwise before turning the top face clockwise.Repeat as necessary until the corners are in the correct place, although they may be rotated incorrectly.Rotate the corners so that the colored squares are on the correct face.Do this by turning the right face counterclockwise, the bottom face counterclockwise, right face clockwise, and the bottom face clockwise.Repeat these steps until the yellow square is in the correct place at the top of the cube.Then you can rotate the top face and perform the same move to place all of the corners in the proper position.Congratulations, youve just completed a Rubiks cube!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they did not specy they would be only for the most disadvantaged kids either, leaving the possibility that they could open for millions of children. At the moment grandparents cannot look after children unless they are part of the same household.From Saturday a grandparent or friend can come to help with childcare and form a social support bubble with another family - but onlythey are currently living alone. per cent of key workers have at least one child aged  or below, the IFS has said.Virtually all key workers – including  per cent of health workers and  per cent of education workers – are either without a partner or have a partner in work, who might not easily be able to look after their children. Around  million people are thought to be in a key worker profession - such as in the NHS, a teacher, or someone delivering vital services like food delivery workers.Former education secretary Lord Baker said today: School holidays should be cancelled this year.Teachers and children have already had too much holiday this year and shouldto learning throughout the summer.By September hundreds of thousands,not millions, of schoolchildren will have had no school experience for more than six months. That is shocking, and some of these pupils will never be able to catch up.He also called for the m rule to be reduced to just one, and for teachers and pupils to get daily tests.Education Select Committee Chair Robert Halfon told The Sun The Government have always said schools are going to close over the summer.But its all the more reason why we need an Alan Turning catch up programme to help them.If schools dont open in September, we will have an ice age in terms of childrens learning.However, while the disadvantaged children had to remain the priority, he suggested that the kids of key workers could be included in a summer camp system to help them be able to carry on working - and to keep children learning.I wouldnt turn any child away from learning, absolutely anyone, he added. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a Volkswagen. I don’t remember the model. It was a dirty, yellowy, mustardy kind of colour.“It was an old one and was long. I heard he still had it around the time Madeleine disappeared, along with the Jaguar.The woman added that Christian B was also suspected to be involved in criminal activity in the local area.She said: “He was always bringing expensive things back to the house. Computers, cameras, things like that. I didn’t ask where he got them from. I remember my friend and I wonderingthey were stolen.It comes as The Sun reported earlier this week that cops were continuing to probe newly unearthed satellite pictures of prime suspect Christian Bs campervan days after Madeleine vanished.A Spanish investigator has spent days scouring old satellite imagery after the -year-old serial child sex beast was identied last week.And German police and Scotland Yard have now been sent a picture which could show the roof of the VW Westfalia T van parked near his former Praia da Luz home.The image could prove crucial because it suggests the distinctive van was taken back to open land Christian B was familiar with after living close-by for six years.But it raises questions over why Christian B ed to the farmhouse just days after Madeleine vanished when he was living in the campervan, not the run-down home.Imagery shows the white roof of a van of similar dimensions to the VW parked beside a hedge yards from a ramshackle single-storey former farmhouse plot.He lived there with a German lover from  to , when he did a runner and left the building strewn with debris including wigs and smashed computer gear.Christian B is also reported to have broken into his British exs flat, after becoming so insanely jealous he hid under the woman’s bed in case she brought another man home.The woman was left traumatised by the incident, three years before three-year-old Maddie was snatched from her holiday home in Praia da Luz on Portugal’s Algarve.Recalling the incident, she told the Mirror: I peeked under and got the shock of my le. He was hiding under there, lying on his back, staring at me.“He got out from under the bed, acted like everything was normal, said goodbye to me, walked out and closed the door behind him.“I was there all alone, just shaking and shaking.”Christian B also brutally beat her during their fling - which lasted less than a year - slamming her head against a wall in the ladies toilets of bar where she worked.The suspect is currently serving a -month prison sentence for a drug offence in high security prison Kiel.His lawyer also confirmed yesterday that he will not give any information about the case.Attorney Friedrich Fülscher, who represents the suspect together with the Hamburg lawyer Johann Schwenn, told RTL today: Christian B is not making any statements on the case at the moment and we ask for your understanding that we as defense attorneys are not making any statements either. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is said that scientists fear making changes to coronavirus policy over the winter given the prospect of a second wave this winter and another lockdown to curb the spread of the bug. Education Select Committee chair Robert Halfon has warned there will be an ice age in terms of learningschools donapost open in September. It came after the Government dropped plans for all primary schoolchildren tofor a month before the summer as the R rate remained too high.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Boris Johnsonaposs current goal is for all pupils toto their classrooms in September. Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted this week it is still uncertainthat will happen. It is said the two-metre social distancing rule could be scrapped by September so schools in England can fully reopen. If it isnapost, pupils may only attend school part-time. Now, an official has said schools may stay closed until early they do not open as planned towards the end of summer. The official, said to be at the heart of coronavirus policy-making, told the Spectator: If Sage are this cautious going into summer, then they are not going to want to be playing fast and loose with the R number heading into winter. Mr Halfon told the Sun: We have to get these children learning again. If schools donapost open in September, we will have an ice age in terms of childrenaposs learning. There will always be a reason not to open schools, butit’s not impossible, thereaposs a way to do it. No said key workers wonapost be able to send their children to school in the summer holidays.  And academy leaders have said pupils will notto school full time in Septemberthe two-metre social distancing rule is still in place, academy leaders say. Star Academy chief executive Hamid Patel told the BBC that schools need a decision on social distancing to be able to start making plans. If the two-metre rule is still in place, no more than half of secondary pupils could attend, and in some schools it would be lower, he added. Meanwhile, the Government has been accused of rushing to announce headline-grabbing policies on schools without properly engaging with head teachers first.  The Prime Minister announced plans for a massive catch-up operation over the summer and beyond for pupils after he faced criticism for dropping plans tomore children to school before September. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, warned the scheme was the latest in a long line of eye-catching announcements that will suffer from a lack of input from the profession. The head of the school leadersapos union said: As with the announcement that all children wouldto primary school before the summer, the Government has rushed to announce headline-grabbing policies without properly engaging with the profession first. The language of summer catch-up completely underplays the scale and the nature of the challenges likely to be faced because of prolonged absence from school. There is no quick fix.

What we need to look at straightaway are the issues which are le-and-death decisions, he said. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   We expect there will be a second spike. We want to know what the Government is going to do when that happens. Mr Abrahamson said action now could also help solidy government plans for fully reopening schools in September and further easing the lockdown, as well as aposlay outapos crucial scientic advice for decision making. The call comes in light of a National Audit Office report, which shows how many of the , patients discharged from hospitals into care homes at the peak of the outbreak were infected with Covid- remains unknown.  Jamie Brownaposs dad Tony died of the virus in Colchester General Hospital on March , less than three weeks after taking a train into central London - something he does regularly. The grieving son, part of the campaign group, has slammed the government for locking down the country too late. The -year-old told the BBC: I canapost help but believe thatweaposd entered lockdown sooner he wouldnapost have been exposed in the way he was, he said.  Tony, , developed a dry cough and temperature before appearing to be on the road to recovery when he was struck down by chest pains the day before he died. Jamie saidthe government had urged people to see a doctor early enough his dad - who was trying to wait it out at home - could still be alive. The groupaposs request comes after Scotlandaposs former chief scientic adviser Professor Dame Anne Glover said an inquiry must be held now because a second wave could come at the same time as winter flu - meaning hospitals could become overrun. Prof Glover, who is now president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, said: Given that second wave is likely to come at a time that is likely to coincide with seasonal influenza, and that would give us serious problems, we really need to understand what the failings have been in our apparent inability to be able to deal with this pandemic appropriately.

He said the policeman was heavily outnumbered, and said his sole aim was to dfuse the tension. Kemran said he told the youths not to act on their anger at a time of heightened tensions. He said: I was telling them that when other police got here all they would see is one of their colleagues on the floor after being attacked and theyaposd arrest everyone in sight, including me.  He said he did his best to avoid being aggressive as he attempted to reason with the youths. Kemran said he shielded the officer in order for people to leave him alone. Four people, including a -year-old boy, were arrested in connection with the incident. They have since been charged with assaulting police officers.Ken Marsh, chairman of the politan Police Federation, told the BBC after the incident: Yet again this starkly shows the dangers [officers] face and the bravery they show each and every day keeping Londoners safe.

Mary Rose Young has been putting her own touches on the beautul country home in Lydney, Gloucestershire, by hand since , when she purchased the property for just £,. After  years in the house, she put it up for sale in  and estate agents told her that she could expect it to fetch at least £, from prospective buyers. But her hopes of selling up to open a boutique hotel nearby were dashed when only one person could be persuaded to view the house, with Mary Rose saying they aposleft pretty quicklyapos. Despite the decor leaving Mary Rose and her husband Phil Butcher stuck in the home, the -year-old potter has refused to paint over her leaposs work and says she still loves her home, which she also uses as a workspace and gallery. She said: I made this house around my own le and I wasnapost thinking about it being sellable. Weaposre living like two children in a dollaposs house and in retrospect why would anybody  want to buy it  Itaposs like a playhouse for adults. I just thought it might go to a mad collector of my work who might want to buy it, but no one was interested.  Only one person came and looked at it in the year it was on the market and they werenapost here long. I think they had just come out of curiosity to see the decoration and were never interested. The estate agents despaired. I could have painted over all my work, but I didnapost want to. I love my house and the house really works for me. Iaposm a colourful person and I even have pink hair. I like it more and more as I get older.  Since the failure to sell left her dreams of running her own hotel in tatters, Mary has doubled down and put even more effort into putting her mark on the property, turning the courtyard into a bright pink painting studio last year. When she originally bought the house, which is comprised of two knocked-through cottages, she painted the entire home white in a bid to bring more light in, but when that failed she began drawing patterns inspired by her colourful pottery on the walls.  She said after doing one wall orange with red dots it helped distract from the fact thereaposs aposhardly any natural lightapos and it went from there. She added: It became a really fun project for me on the side of my pottery business and I was so galvanised by it I ended up neglecting my pottery at times. Mary Rose has also incorporated her pottery pieces into the homeaposs features, with a pottery chandelier in the sitting room and handmade pottery tiles in the bathroom.

And small businesses especially are hoping that customers willto empty shopping streets and help independent shops back on their feet. We visited one typical high street, in Farsley, Leeds, to find out how shopkeepers have coped during lockdown, and are preparing for the ‘new normal’. No.a Jewellery shop Bridal jewellery specialist Victoria Walker says all planned weddings have been cancelled or postponed. However, the increase in deaths boosted her other line in memorial jewellery. She says: “I don’t know what I’d have done without the Government grant. The whole point of our shop is to offer a personalised service. “I’m planning a phasedfrom next week, opening from Wednesday to Saturday – and I hope local people still remember us in the coming months.”  No. Dancewear With dance and exercise classes shut, it is a worrying time for Debs Hemingway, who opened Damsell Dancewear four years ago and was planning on giving up her other job as a school exams manager this year. She says: “I’m not rushing to open, as it will mean making big changes to the shop, and only have customers by appointment. “September is normally the busiest month. If things don’t get back to normal by then it’s going to be horrendous.”  No. - Greengrocer Family-run Sutclfe’s has stayed open with social distancing measures in place and has seen a huge increase in customers. Lianne Sutclfe, pictured outside the shop with her brother, Richard, says: “We’ve all been working -hour days, or more. “People have been queuing around the street and we’ve been turning over three times what we would normally make. “The support we’ve had has been amazing.”  No.- Butcher Kevin Harvey is one of a few shop owners to have benefited from lockdown, and has even had to take on extra staff. The butcher’s has been open the whole time and Kevin says: “It’s been absolutely crazy. “I think people wanted to avoid the supermarket, so they would come to get their meat from me, knowing they were supporting local business too. “But I want things back to how they were, for all the shops. I’m hopeful. Let’s see what happens.”  No. - The Fleece Pub Manager John McIntyre, who lives above his pub, had just taken over running it a month before it had to close – with a salary based on a percentage of his earnings. He says: “The owners let me stay rent-free and told me to eat as much food as I want. “But I’ve only been earning enough to survive on, just doing takeaway Sunday lunches and taking the same percentage. “We’ve just heard that pubs with beer gardens might be able to reopen on June , which would be great. It’s been very boring and lonely.”  No. - Florist Adrienne Prest says that the closure of her shop Adrienne Florist has allowed her a well-deserved rest, and she is not thinking of reopening straight away. The florist, who had to furlough two staff, said: “Luckily, Mother’s Day came just before we had to close down and \u2028we still did really well. “We can open on Monday but I’m just not too sure. People like to pick everything up, so that would be awkward. And as I don’t know how busy we might be, I don’t know how much stock to get it. I think I’m going to play it by ear.”  No. - Coffee shop Fay Freeman and her partner, Mark Stephenson, who opened Cooper’s  years ago, tried to keep trading in lockdown by selling takeaways. But they couldn’t juggle work with home-schooling and caring for their children. Fay says: “We feel we were well supported by the council with a grant but we are unsure what will happen. “We are a small shop andthe two-metre rule stands we will only be able to have two tables inside and two outside, and will rely heavily on takeaway orders. But we have lots of lovely regular customers who we feel will support us.” No. - Jeweller Lockdown hit GEM T hard – but owner Nigel Tate knows coronavirus has been worse for many others. He says: “Prior to closing, Leeds United legend Norman Hunter, his we and daughter came in, and we were laughing and joking. Soon after he caught coronavirus and died, which was terrible. “I had to furlough a part-time member of staff, and cut back on what I spend. “We’ve got quite a loyal band of customers, hopefully they’ll come back to us.”  No. - Car dealership James Doyle opened Doyles again on June  but he believes he’ll never recover the two months of \u2028lost sales – a time in which two of his staff were furloughed. “This is going to be a tough year,” he says. “I think it will be a long time before we’re back to normal and I’m worried about the coming years too. “But the Government aid has really helped us stay afloat.” No. - Hair and beauty salon Lynn Holmes is still waiting to hear when\u2028 pH can reopen. In the meantime, she is helping her staff and making preparations. She says: “The challenges will be huge but nothing that others aren’t facing too. I’m hoping clients will be understanding as we will not be able to accommodate as many people. “Financially it will be a struggle at first and I also feel there will be a recession. “On a personal level it has been stressful but there are thousands of people who are far worse, with loved ones ill or lost.”  No. - Hairstylists Smitin Hair boss Johan Smit, who started his business  years ago, is planning on reopening on July  but with many changes... He says: “We’ve received a -page document from the National Hairdressers’ Federation with all the stuff we have to adhere to. We can’t see as many people at one time and can’t have as many stylists in the shop at one time. “Luckily, I don’t need to lay anyone off, as two are going on maternity leave in the next few months. I’m looking forward to getting back. I miss our clients – three months not seeing them is a long time.”  No. - DIY Pet supplies Mark Cox has kept working after being surprised to find his business was on the list of essential supplies. He said: “I installed a temporary counter at the front and began to allow one customer in at a time. “A customer tells me what they want and I go and get it. Lots of people in lockdown have been doing DIY, so I’m doing about the same trade as I normally do.” No. - Opticians Tunnaclfe  Lambert closed at the end of March and owner Andrew Lambert still doesn’t have a date for reopening. He says: “When we do open it will be very dferent. As well as social distancing and screens at reception, we will have entry-by-appointment and will need to allow much longer for each patient. “This means we’ll only be able to see half our previous numbers. Coupled with the cost of PPE for staff and patients, things will be tight.”  No. - Laundrette Bubbles owner Nicola Knowles has been open for business throughout lockdown. But takings are down due to other shops being closed and she has had to make changes to keep staff and customers Covid secure. She says: “We’ve had to stop people using the machines themselves. “Guidance says washing over C kills the virus, so I’ve bought disinfectant to put with washingpeople don’t want a wash over C. We’ve kept prices the same, we’ve had to make a loss on that. “I’m hoping that when the shops open people will start venturing out more and business will start going up.”  No. - Barbers Urban Man owner Tony Nelson says he is “really looking forward to reopening” on July  – with big changes to keep clients safe. Tony says: “I’ve had no income since we closed since March , which has affected me, and two members of staff furloughed. “I’ve made changes, such as reducing seating, installing screens between customers and introducing an outside waiting area. “All staff will be wearing PPE and customers will be offered hand sanitiser and PPE too.”  No. - Clothes shop Wardrobe  only opened in October, so Nicola Connor had little time to build customer loyalty before lockdown. But she is cautiously optimistic about reopening on Tuesday. “I put pictures of our clothes on Facebook and started offering free, safe local delivery, and I’ve been astounded how well it’s gone,” she says.  “I’ll be starting with reduced hours and only two customers allowed in at a time. “I’m trying to stay positive. I’m just hoping that next week people will have that little walk outside and pop in to say hello.” "},{"url":null,"title":"human bones discovered during gas","story":"NewsHuman bones discovered during gas repair work as forensic officers seal off areaA forensic tent covers the site where the bones were found, while a police car has been keeping guard over night, since the grisly find by gas repair workers in North ShieldsShareCommentsByIan JohnsonLorraine King:,  JUN NewsHuman bones were found by the workers in North Shields \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

As such, an official at the Anglican church told ChronicleLive that they do not expect the remains to be the result of anything sinister. The graveyard was closed in  so there have been no burials since then, and Albion Road was widened in about , said the female, who declined to be named. Instead, she suggested they may have been remains - buried before the road was widened - that had been missed off during the work a century ago. A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: “Shortly after .am on Wednesday we received a report that suspected human bones had been found during gas work repairs on Albion Road, North Shields. “Officers are now working with forensic experts to determine the age of the bones and the circumstances behind their discovery.  A cordon remains in place and enquiries are ongoing.” The news comes after a creepy wall made from human bones and skulls was discovered under a cathedral in Ghent. Researchers from Ruben Willaert BVBA made the eerie findings while exploring St Bavo’s Cathedral in February.The wall was found to mainly consist of thigh and shin bones from adults, which the researchers believe date back to the late th century.

For example, we will probably be limiting the number of people who can come in at first, as well as having a one-way system in place. We also need to retrain all our staff on what they need to be aware of while serving, like having to hold glasses at the bottom and that customers are not allowed to bring glasses back to the bar.

She was arrested after officers recognised descriptions of her as having “fat cheeks” and resembling the TV funnyman. A court heard MacDonald stole from one woman as she pretended to deliver Easter eggs. And prosecutor Gavin Howie said another victim, Mary Wilson, , had £ stolen from her hand after she visited a cashpoint on a shopping trip. He said: “She was approached by a person who she thought was a man but was actually this defendant who said ‘be careful there lots of wrong people about here after money and drugs.’ How prophetic she was. “Shewalked to a nearby farm foods shop and asked them to call police and described the defendant as looking a bit like Johnny Vegas.” At Manchester Crown Court Mrs Wilson, a widow, said: “I am cautious and think of myself as streetwise despite my age. I believe the defendant targeted me and assumed I would not protest as an elderly woman. “I am a strong person and am one of  children and I want to tell the defendant just how wrong what they did was.”  Mr Howie added: “These were quite deliberate and targeted attacks on elderly, disabled and vulnerable people and they caused emotional distress and a loss of confidence for the victims. “In all these incidents she attacked elderly people where she hovered around them before she struck.” MacDonald, from Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, admitted five counts of theft between February and April , plundering almost £, from five women, and was jailed for a year. She had previous  offences dating back to , including robbery and theft.  In mitigation her lawyer Jane Dagnall said: “These were despicable offences and she has an appalling record and she paints a pathetic persona today. She is an animated character who was previously given a chance by a court, tried hard but failed and her demons got the better of her.’’ Sentencing her, Judge Alan Conrad QC told MacDonald: “You stole from elderly and vulnerable people whose confidence you set to gain and then distract them in order to steal from them. It is despicable that you prey on vulnerable people in this way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sarah Churchill had a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath at the end of February - when just  people had tested positive for coronavirus. But instead of getting a fever or persistent cough, incredibly painful rashes flared up on her hands and feet. At first doctors thought she might have blood cancer or even HIV and were left stumped when medical tests showed no ailments. Terried Sarah thought she was going to die and was scared she would leave her nine-year-old son Noah alone. Eventually, more than three months later, the -year-old was told she had contracted Covid- in late February. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Now Sarah wants to warn other Brits - who have suffered rashes - that they might have unknowingly got the deadly virus as well. It was pretty scary being told I might have HIV or blood cancer, she said. I really thought I would die. Itaposs been an emotional rollercoaster. The silver lining is that I havenapost got a le-threatening condition like blood cancer or hepatitis. But I still donapost know what damage has been done to my body. People could be Covid- positive, with no other symptoms, and have no idea. They could be spreading the virus, without knowing they have it. Sarah first felt ill at the end of February - weeks before Britain went into lockdown, and only around a dozen Covid- cases had been confirmed.  She says she got night sweats, a racing heartbeat and severe shortness of breath. Her GP put it down to the flu and she didnapost think anything  of it. However a week later, horrible red marks flared up on her hands, feet and nose. Her doctor was left gazumped and said he thought she was immunosuppressed. He thought Sarah might even have blood cancer or even suffer HIV. I just thought I was going to die, shocked Sarah said. It was so unusual I just thought thataposs it, my luck is up, Iaposm going to die of blood cancer.  My father died of cancer, and it brought all of the emotion back now. The mum-of-one had numerous blood tests, but the doctor was left astonished when the results came back normal. This was on March , and as time went on Sarahaposs rashes got more painful. Often she was unable to stand on the balls of her feet, or open drinks bottles. I looked like I had the plague, she said. Itaposs an incredibly painful condition, itaposs not pleasant at all.  Not even resting my hands or feet helped, it just got worse over time. She had more blood tests and consultations and eventually at the start of June a dermatology specialist told Sarah she had had Covid-. He said the lesions were consistent with symptoms experienced by some people who had the killer virus, and her bloodwork was the same. At least my symptoms finally made sense, Sarah said.

An analysis of the COVID Symptom Trackeraposs figures suggests there had been , new cases per day a week earlier before that figure dropped by  per cent. However, the true rate is likely much higher, as the latest data - collected between May  and June  - does not include Northern Ireland or any UK care homes - where the virus is still spreading.The app, from health company ZOE, gathers reported symptoms by users along official diagnoses and personal health and demographic information to make predictionssymptomatic users who have not been tested for coronavirus would be likely to test positive.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.In contrast, the Department of Health figures showed , new cases yesterday because it only records formally diagnosed instances.

Andrew Morton, who has written several books about the family, said he doesnapost believe the monarch will be able to resume her official duties amid lockdown. He claims Covid has practically put Charles on the throne, and says the virus has done more damage to the monarchy than Oliver Cromwell. The Queen and Prince Philip have been social distancing at Windsor Castle since the government restrictions were put in place. At  and , they are both in the vulnerable category and have been carrying out their royal duties via video call and on the phone.  Speaking to the , Morton says that while he believes the Queen would love to get out and start meeting people again, he doesnapost believe it will be possible.He said: “The brutal truth is that her reign is effectively over. Covid- has done more damage to the monarchy than Oliver Cromwell. “Corona has practically put Charles on the throne. “It’s terribly sad but I can’t see how the Queen can resume her job. The Covid- virus isn’t going away soon and will be with us for monthsnot years.  If she gets the bug it could be fatal and would put Prince Philip at risk as well. The Queen has been continuing her duties remotely, and today carried out her first official video call. She joined Princess Anne to speak to some of Britainaposs selfless carers, listening to stories of their daily lives and struggles.The Queen and Anne worked with the Carers Trust to set up the chat, focusing on the extra work theyaposve been doing since the coronavirus Covid- pandemic.Her Majesty told them: Iaposm very impressed by what you have achieved already.  Right now in the UK  million people are caring unpaid for a frail, ill or disabled family member or friend. The Queen and The Princess Royal heard from Alex, Amna, Mary and Nadia, who are all the primary carers for family members, about the dferent roles that carers have to play, and the challenge of juggling their own physical and mental health with that of their loved ones. Nadia Taylor, , from London, cares full time for her mother, father, husband and daughter – who all live together, with her other child.  She said: The call was about  minutes and the Queen was on for about  minutes of that. She asked us all questions. We talked about how we are all coping in the current climate with Covid-. I explained to her how much more isolated carers are at the moment. Many don’t have laptops or tablets and feel very cut off.

The stench of vomit, sweat and faeces worked its way into the very planks of the ship. Olaudah Equiano, trafficked from Africa to the West Indies, described the so-called ‘Middle Passage’ across the Atlantic Ocean: ‘The shrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a scene of horror almost inconceivable.’ On their arrival in Barbados, ‘the buyers rush at once into the yard and make choice of that parcel they like best.’ Between  and , British ships transported . million slaves to work on sugar plantations and cotton fields. Over % of the enslaved Africans regularly died during the journey. Some captains even threw slaves overboard, and tried to claim insurance on the lost ‘cargo.’ So, few will shed any tears for the memory of Edward Colston, whose statue was pulled down in Bristol as the Black Lives Matter campaign focused on the historic symbols of British racism. There seemed a poetic justice to Colston being dumped in the docks where his slave ships once set sail. Personally, I would rather the memorial had entered a museum much earlier, under the democratic leadership of the local council.  But now comes the question, who’s next  And what real change for today’s Black communities will this destruction of symbols of slavery lead to  Students are demanding the removal of William Gladstone’s name from an university building because of the Victorian Prime Minister’s family involvement in slavery. Statues of the famous Conservative leader Robert Peel, Scouts founder Robert Baden Powell, even Nelson’s Column have also been targeted. The danger of removing every street name and monument which highlight our bloody past is that future generations may become ignorant of our brutal heritage.  The truth is slavery is deeply embedded in the history of modern Britain, and we need to understand more not less of that violent and racist legacy. Take Liverpool, Britain’s leading slave port in the s which saw , ships sail out of the Mersey to trade African slaves and thenladen with cotton, sugar, and rum. The yield from human trafficking transformed Merseyside into a booming metropolis and the ‘West African business,’ as it was called, was commemorated in streets names and monuments from Jamaica Street to Rope Walk, the Nelson Monument to the Town Hall – with its carved busts of Africans and Elephants.  In the countryside, profits from West Indian plantations built some of the most beautul stately homes and rolling estates of England. Harewood House – the Yorkshire seat of the Lascelles family – owes its magnicence to the , acres of sugar cane fields held across Barbados, Jamaica, and Tobago, as well as a particularly inhumane fleet of slaving vessels anchored off the Guinea coast at Anomabu. More than that, the wealth that came from sugar and slavery gave Britain the funds for the Industrial Revolution. Our pioneering history of industrialisation – in coal cotton and shipbuilding – was heavily indebted to the riches that flowed from the enslavement and sale of Africans. The beauty and elegance of Edinburgh, London, Glasgow and Bath were secured by slave investments.  We need to acknowledge that history. At the Victoria  Albert Museum , we have traced the origins of some of our collections to slave money - and highlighted this terrible contrast between beautul, precious objects and the bloody funds behind them. As museums, we have to be clearer about these uncomfortable truths in our galleries and ensure more Black voices, artefacts and perspectives are heard. From the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool to recent sculptures by Kara Walker in Tate Modern , there is a determination to do so. And, of course, our schools need more time to teach this complex past.  Slavery and Empire are present in the curriculum, but there is simply not enough space given to history in the timetable – and so the story of colonialism and slavery, and its legacies today, is lost. So, I hope we can add to this history, rather than subtract from it. With new plaques on old statues contemporary memorials to those lost to slavery and more space for Black figures in our public squares and streets.

For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the gravity of the pandemic and pushed local governments to lt quarantine measures, sending contradictory signals to Brazilians on whether to use masks and practise social distancing. The president has not realized that this is one of the most dramatic crises in Brazilaposs history, said organiser Antonio Carlos Costa, who criticized Bolsonaro for not showing solidarity with the suffering. Families are mourning thousands of dead, and there is unemployment and hunger, he said. But not everyone agreed with the protest.

His British ex girlfriend says the German paedophile was driving the battered Volkswagen estate around the time the three-year-old vanished. Detectives investigating Brueckner’s potential involvement released images of two vehicles linked to him – a black Jaguar and a two-tone camper van.But now his ex has sensationally revealed he owned a third car, details of which have never been made public. The woman, from Berkshire, said he began driving the estate in mid-, two years before Madeleine disappeared. He also owned the black Jaguar at this time but had not yet bought the camper van featured in police photographs.His ex has been interviewed about the vehicles Brueckner was driving, but is unsureshe mentioned the VW estate to cops. Police in Germany have not disclosedMadeleine’s DNA has been discovered in Brueckner’s camper van or Jaguar.  But with German prosecutors saying they do not currently have enough evidence to charge him, the suggestion is they have not found any. The undiscovered VW estate, therefore,traced, could potentially hold the clues to finally crack the case. His ex, a British mum aged , who we have agreed not to name, has given detectives crucial leads about their main suspect. They include details of his associates in the Algarve and Germany, the layout of his home in Praia da Luz, and remote beaches that he took her to. We revealed yesterday how she dated the German for nearly a year during  and , when they both worked in the same bar in Lagos in the Algarve. She told how he broke into her flat through a window and hid under her bed, hours after he brutally attacked her in a jealous rage when she innocently hugged another man.  Brueckner allegedly repeatedly slammed her head against a wall in the toilets of the bar where she worked. The woman now believes that Brueckner, who is in prison in Germany, could be responsible for the abduction of Madeleine in Praia da Luz in .She revealed details of the third vehicle owned by Brueckner in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror. She said: “Towards the end of our relationship he had another car as well as the Jaguar.  “I haven’t seen that mentioned anywhere. It was a Volkswagen. I don’t remember the model. It was a dirty, yellowy, mustardy kind of colour. “It was an old one and was long. I heard he still had it around the time Madeleine disappeared, along with the Jaguar.I think I told the Portuguese police all about the cars, but I can’t be sure about the estate.  “When I spoke to the Portuguese police I tried to help as much as I could, but Portuguese isn’t my first language. “I’d be happy to talk to British police about it – maybe it could help their case and solve what happened to Madeleine  “Chris loved his cars, especially his Jaguar. It was his pride and joy. It was very clean and he drove it carefully.” Portuguese detectives have quizzed the woman about Brueckner’s farmhouse on the outskirts of Praia da Luz. She spent many nights with him in the run-down property, less than a mile from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz, where Madeleine vanished from while on holiday with her family in May .  She said: “I never lived with him but I often stayed over though. His house was okay, it was old but he kept it tidy and clean. It had one bedroom. I’ve seen the photos and instantly recognised the big tree trunk in the middle of the room.”The woman also told police how she and her pals suspected Brueckner of burgling homes and businesses in the area. She said: “He was always bringing expensive things back to the house. Computers, cameras, things like that. I didn’t ask where he got them from. I remember my friend and I wonderingthey were stolen.  “We said we think he might be involved in some illegal business because he seems to have money but we don’t know where it comes from.Maybe selling stolen property, nothing too big. He also used to collect golf balls because his property was near the golf course and then sell them to the players.”The woman is still living in fear that Brueckner will be released and come after her.She said: “He came to Portugal with a German girl. He said they grew up in a children’s home together. She left him for someone . He said to me once thathe ever found her he would kill her. “It made me think,he said that about her, what would he do to meI left him ’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mum says putting others first","story":"NewsMum says putting others first is exhausting as she lays bare parenting strugglesJessica Hood, from Melbourne, Australia, says in the Instagram post her le consists of \"putting everyone  first\" as she raises her four childrenShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  JUN NewsJessica Hood, , who lives in Melbourne, told how she has lost herself in the process of raising four children \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We do a bit of cycling but not every day so that#ll be the biggest challenge, but she is ready to take the bull by the horns.#Jane is hopeful the money raised will be able to make a dference to other children and families who may be experiencing hardship during the Covid- lockdown and is keen to raise as much as possible.#Holly is always checking the total and thinking about how many people that will help, so that#s been lovely to see,# she added.#We#ve been out and about, seeing dferent things and it#s good to do it for a good cause as well.#We are doing it until next Monday but knowing Holly, she might just keep going.#Holly#s efforts has caught the eye of the charity, which has shown its support for the fundraiser  on Facebook, saying: #It#s absolutely amazing. Thank you all so much.#To find out more about her amazing effort and for details on how to donate, visit Holly#s dedicated fundraiser page on Facebook.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There are a number of players we are looking at because we know what we need.“We are looking to strengthen the wider areas because we don’t have a lot in there at the minute.“We have a few young ones but senior-wise we only have Paul McMullan and Peter Pawlett.“We would like to add another couple because we feel moving up a level we need that pace in the wide areas to break teams and also to counter-attack at the many tough venues we will encounter next season.“They are all key areas we have been doing a lot of work on, looking at players and we are just waiting to make our move really.”Robbie Neilson admits Dundee United are already looking to snap up their next superstar-in-waiting\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-robbie-neilson-transfers embed # secretAGbVqRTtF\" data-secret\"AGbVqRTtF\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

They packed up and left soon after being spoken to.Mr Turnbull said: ldquoIt beggars belief that these visitors from Edinburgh feel they can drive to Peebles, go through a gate which is chained, and park up on what is clearly park land.ldquoTo then erect what seems to be a toilet on the grass near Fotheringham Bridge really is a step too far.ldquoWhere any of this human waste was dumped, is a question I would like answering.Mr Turnbull says he has asked council officials to make sure the gate is secured with a ldquoheavy padlock.The community leader believes misbehaving visitors are guilty of showing a ldquocomplete disregard for the regulations and the people of Peebles.He added: ldquoAs the town begins to recover from this crisis, we do want and need visitors to come and enjoy what we have to offer, but is it too much to ask for them to be respectful and responsible Chief Inspector Stuart Reid said: \"The current regulations are clear: people should only leave the house for very limited purposes, for example for basic necessities, for exercise or recreation, for medical needs or travelling for work which cannot be done from home.\"We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing and remember the purpose of these measures is to aid the collective effort to protect the NHS and save lives by preventing the virus from spreading.\"Our officers will continue to engage with the public, explain the legislation and guidance and encourage compliance.\"We will use enforcement as a last resort only where there is a clear breach of the legislation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"strawberry-moon-2020-time-see-skies-uk","story":"The UKis to be graced by a Strawberry Moon this week in a rare lunar event that will lightup the skies.The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.What does NASA say about the Strawberry Moon As described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.ldquoAccording to this almanac, the full moon in June or the last full Moon of spring is known as the Strawberry Moon, a name universal to just about every Algonquin tribe.ldquoThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in northeastern North America.The Strawberry Moon has also been referred to as the Hot Moon.So, when can I see it You can expect to see the spectacular lunar event at about .pm BST on Friday evening.According to the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, the Strawberry Moon will last for up to three tofour days."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-make-face-mask","story":"YOUVE probably heard by now that wearingface coverings in Scotlands public placescould become mandatory in the future.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed this was under consideration in her daily briefing yesterday, but stressed there is no timescale on when the wearing of one mightenforced across the country.Ms Sturgeon was keen to emphasise medical face masks should be prioritised for frontline workers and instead has encouraged Scots to make their own face coverings from home.Whether you are handy with a Singer or just want a quick fix, there are so many ways you can make sure you are protected.Heres our guide to dferent types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.What do I need to make a face covering There are many dferent materials you can use to protect yourself and stop the spread of Covid- to those around you.This ranges from bandanas, to t-shirts, fabrics, to string.

Scottish Government to extend the National Development status it gave the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in their planned revised frameworkwhich is under reviewThe map is part of a wide-ranging consultation which will be launched on the councilrsquos consultation hub on Monday and tackles everything from the environment to travel, leisure and geothermic and renewable energy.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells to look at the latest technology and reducing the town and surrounding areas carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater from the area to create waterways and how they can be used to create geothermic energy projects.Project leader Douglas Proudfoot said the idea behind the new water features across the area was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent. The firrst houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.ldquoI

kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar

and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as

ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"tell-difference-symptoms-hay-fever-covid-19","story":"It comes as the weather gets warmer and summer approaches, with hay fever sufferers having to cope with more pollen

If only it were that much fun. Unable to browse without creating a traffic jam, and surrounded by so many masks it could be a dental hygienistsrsquo convention, all pleasure has gone.Now, we are on the cusp of phase two lt-off, scheduled for June . Unless you are in the shielded category, this will allow two households to meet indoors, or socially distanced drinkers and diners to sup in beer gardens and at pavement tables. Home improvers who have been doodling plans for loft conversions can at last call in the Light Brigade.Around the time schools resume in August, itrsquos likely that there will be a widespreadto something approximating normality. In theory at least. The worry is that,the grim weekly supermarket trip offers any guide, the new normal might feel almost as disturbing as our current lockdown. The sight of medicalised faces, half hidden beneath WWII gas masks or snorkels the constant need to self-disinfect ndash a breeding ground surely for a generation of obsessive compulsives the notices and tannoyed reminders that you or others in the vicinity could be unwitting transmitters of a potentially fatal disease ndash none of this is conducive to a sense of relaxation or safety. And yet, unless there is a surge back to our old ways, the economy will slide even further into the abyss. Itrsquos hard not to feel a moral obligation to help businesses get back on their feet.Some weeks ago, I contemplated what I was most looking forward to doing when we emerged from purdah. Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes. And in one respect at least Irsquom looking forward to making my own mask. In winter I resemble a figure in a John Bellany painting, my nose ice cold and red raw. A fleecy face-covering could save on central heating.Even as the danger of infection diminishes, the sobering reality is that fear will persist for a considerable time. To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost. As yoursquoll have guessed, Irsquom not Melrosersquos answer to Marco Polo. When Ryanairrsquos engines begin to roar, it wonrsquot be me yoursquoll see in the duty free. Yet the mere fact of being banned from travelling more than five miles from home is what has felt so constricting in recent times, even , like me, yoursquore usually quite happy staying within easy walking distance of your door.As we go through the gradual phases of our staggered release, like a barge inching through a lock, simply knowing that we can go wherever we like will come as a tremendous relief. Who careswe must be home by bedtime  Just glimpsing somewhere dferent will be excitement enough. It marks the restoration of a basic human liberty. And, as our leash ens, so spirits will lt. The invisible cordon sanitaire that has been restraining us in will vanish, and to a large degree our lives will feel like our own again.Yet while we yearn to get back to our old haunts, elements of the crisis have shown a better way, which hopefully will endure. The rise in walking and cycling signals a serious cultural sht. Along with the upturn in home deliveries, it might indicate the beginning of the end for the car. Even where I live, in the country, the air is cleaner, the roads emptier, the birds louder. The outpouring of care and concern shown across the nation for neighbours and those in need has strengthened peoplersquos connection to their community. More of us have been shopping or ordering locally, and discovering whatrsquos on our doorstep. Some have been baking their own bread, or cooking from scratch, and discovering the humdrum but satisfying joys of home le. Looking to the uncertain future, a few are on their way to becoming self-sufficient.As we gradually emerge into a freer existence, carrying hand sanitisers the way Clint Eastwood holstered a Colt , one thing seems certain. We wonrsquot take anything for granted again. The simplest of activities have already assumed a profound signicance. To call something ordinary or normal will soon be the highest terms of praise.

He is talking to someone who is off camera, ashe is being interviewed. ldquoAs far as Irsquom concerned every other party represents selfishness, he says. ldquoBasically, itrsquos fairness Irsquom looking for. The picture fades and the slogan ldquoScotland will win with Labour appears.ldquoI was kind of conned into it, says Connolly now. ldquoI was asked to come up to a meeting I might find interesting. I went, I didnrsquot find it interesting, but somebody asked me a question, I answered and I suddenly discovered I was on the [party political broadcast].

She started to try to lsquoout slumrsquo me, saying my slum was worse than your slum. That thing Labour politicians do. I find it pathetic.Connolly has long lampooned notions of Scottishness, nationalism, and patriotism in general. In the  referendum he refused to back Yes, saying he was ldquodeeply suspicious of patriotism. The Brexit vote seemed to change the pro-European Connollyrsquos mind. Last year, when askedhe would like to see Scotland independent, he replied: ldquoI donrsquot know. If Scotland would like it, I would like it.Billy and Us finds the now retired stand-up still performing a dance of the seven veils on independence, but he seems to inch further towards it than ever before.Insisting that his politics change ldquodaily, he says: ldquoIrsquove never liked nationalism in any of its guises. Irsquom not saying Irsquove never agreed with independence. I think a Scottish republic is as good an idea as any I ever heard. But I donrsquot represent anybody, or anything.

He went from his home in working class Partick to the West End, where a woman asked him to go to the cellar and bring back some ldquoanthracite.ldquoThere was only coal there, he says, laughing. ldquoI thought God, they even have dferent names for coal up here.

His celebrity friends, and his playing the laird at the Lonach Highland Games, where he entertained guests including Prince Charles, Steve Martin and the late Robin Williams, led to criticism that he was forgetting his working class roots.Though the programme never asks him about the celebrity circuit directly, he says: ldquoIrsquod be invited to dinners, Irsquod turn up and have a good laugh. But I never wanted to be part of it. Itrsquos just not my cup of tea.The concept of class continues to fascinate and repel him.

And I must say Irsquove always found my private interactions with her to be quite the opposite of the persona which her opponents and some sections of the press advance. I find her warm, open, friendly, interested and engaged. I like her, and I like that I like her, because shersquos my First Minister just as she is everyone rsquos.Now, the purpose of this story is not as a prelude to a column about operations, or books, or children. It is, instead, an introduction to a column about people. People like you and me. People like Nicola Sturgeon and, yes, Boris Johnson too.We would, all of us, do well to remember that our leaders possess all the same human failures and frailties as the rest of us. Millions of us know all about failure and frailty, now. I fear I am comprehensively hopeless as a home teacher. Others are discovering that DIY is not for them. Many are trying and failing to work effectively away from their office.Our own personal failings may not surprise us. Many people will have baked it into  ndash itrsquos a year of treading water and hoping you can hold on.Not so for our leaders. Far from treading water, the national expectation is that they will dominate these choppiest of seas and swim us to a brighter future.Imagine living with this level of responsibility, at this time. And imagine leadership when the tools with which Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson have had to work are so rusty and rotten.Consider first that they were confronted at the outset of the pandemic with two dferent sets of mass death, faced to choose one over the other. One set is obvious ndash those who were about to die from Covid-. This is a large number, originally estimated at around a quarter of a million, but because of lockdown now sitting at a couple of hundred thousand less than that.This imminent death stalked our leaders. The obvious human reaction was to try to save people. They did. But they knew the cost of doing so. Covid kills, but lockdown kills too. It kills more slowly and unpredictably, and indeed in ways that may never be fully understood, but those who die in a year from that undiagnosed cancer, or in five years from the mental ill health into which they slipped, or in  years from the poverty into which they were plunged by unemployment, or in  years from the alcoholism which started during lockdown.Imagine being a leader who has to make this choice.Secondly, it is becoming increasingly obvious that our leaders have been relying on scientic and medical advice which has been, to be charitable, transient. It is, I am sure, frustrating for Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson to hear thatthey had locked down earlier they could have saved lives, particularly so since the people telling them this are the same people whose advice on lockdown timing was followed in March. Equally frustrating is to be ridiculed by the medical community for flirting with a herd immunity strategy when those advancing the strategy in the first place were the leaders of that community.It has become very ldquoon-trend to heap opprobrium on politicians who fail to listen to experts it is less clear how we should judge a politician who listens to experts only to find that those experts have changed their minds. Experts can u-turn with little consequence not so politicians.Imagine being a leader who has to grapple with this.Thirdly, we might do well to think about the personal strain on our leaders. When, reader, did you last have a day off  Are you on one right now  Was it yesterday  Or last weekend  When do you suppose Ms Sturgeon last had a day off  Irsquod guess February.Mr Johnson has had more time off than Ms Sturgeon, but that was to recover from a le-threatening altercation with the coronavirus, for which he can perhaps be forgiven.Imagine being a leader who has an obligation to make decisions which will impact all of us for decades to come, all while yoursquore, for want of a better word, knackered.This is not an appeal for us all to feel sorry for those in power. They chose this le indeed, in the case of both Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon they coveted the job for many years before reaching office.It is an appeal, though, to think of the politicians with whom we disagree as human beings before we enter into a political discourse which opposes or abuses them.I am not comfortable with every decision made by our leaders, and over the summer I expect to find myself shaking and nodding my head in equal measure at the steps they take to remove us from lockdown.However, that is easy for me to do, sitting behind a laptop. And itrsquos easy for opposition politicians, too, knowing that they have no realistic prospect of having to make these decisions themselves.If I could make one appeal to opponents of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson it would be this. Disagree with their actions ndashthatrsquos healthy and indeed in some cases necessary. But think carefully before questioning their motives for taking them.Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson are currently in the midst of the most dficult period of political leadership outside of world wars. Their opponents would do well to recognise that le in opposition is simpler, easier and less consequential than le in government.Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson are the people in the office. In the final analysis, itrsquoll be they who are judged.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Their debut album, Garlands was an independent chart hit the follow-up, Head Over Heels reached number  in the mainstream charts. The next three, increasingly assured, albums ndash Treasure, Victorialand and Blue Bell Knoll ndash all charted, the middle one getting to number . As thehas said of them, the band ldquoemerged fully formed from the post-punk shadows and developed a sound that would become the gold standard for enigmatic, ethereal indie-pop. A key feature was Liz Fraserrsquos otherworldly voice, set against atmospheric guitars. And those dreamy, elusive, enigmatic song titles: For Phoebe Still a Baby, Cico Buff, A Kissed-out Red Floatboat hellipSimple MindsThe Glasgow band had released their first two albums, Le in a Day and Real to Real Cacophony, in . Their fourth album, Sons  Fascination Sister Feelings Callbrought them to widespread notice. The next two ndash New Gold Dream and the chart-topping Sparkle in the Rain ndash yielded some of their most powerful and impassioned songs, from Promised You a Miracle and Someone Somewhereto Up on the Catwalk, Waterfront and Speed Your Love to Me. Once Upon a Timeincluded another: Alive and Kicking. That year they played Live Aid, from Philadelphia. By then, they were on top of the world.LLOYD COLE AND THE COMMOTIONSPERFECT Skin, Forest Fire, Are You Ready to be Heartbroken  Rattlesnakeswas one of the best albums of the Eighties, merging ldquoByrds-like guitar figures to Colersquos languid, Lou Reed-inspired intonation. Cole told thea few years back, ldquoMany of the songs are based on a year I spent in London studying law, when I was  or . The landscape for the album was my imagination. Irsquod been to Europe once, but my romantic imagery was from books or films. I stumbled on a way of creating an image with very few words.The Blue NileEndlessly written about, endlessly enthused over. What is there left to say about this superlative trio  The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music is admirably succinct, referring to the bandrsquos ldquogently emotive synthetics and an overall mood that seemed to revel in nocturnal atmospherics that graced their  debut, A Walk Across the Rooftops. The follow-up, Hats , an undisputed masterpiece, ldquofinally continued the shimmering legacy of its predecessor. It was Scotlandrsquos favourite album in a Herald poll in . Mere words canrsquot do the justice to the Blue Nilersquos exquisite, tender, emotional, observational music.THE ASSOCIATESSULK, this post-punk duorsquos  album is, says Spoty, ldquothe bandrsquos definitive statement ndash a fascinating blend of lush, New Romantic popcraft and dark, surreal cabaret stylings.in , said Sulk had a fair claim to the title of the most extraordinary album of the s. Billy MacKenzieand Alan Rankin came up with so many compelling songs: Party Fears Two, Club Country, Skipping, to name just three.JOSEF KConsiderable excitement greeted the release late last year of The Scottish Affair , a lavishly-packaged recording of a  Brussels gig by this influential group. That, and their solitary studio album, The Only Fun in Town, are forceful reminders of why so many continue to admire a band whose influences included Pere Ubu, Television and Talking Heads.ORANGE JUICEAS Uncut magazine observed a while back, in the late seventies a youthful Edwyn Collins met up with a crowd of like-minded Glaswegian musicians and formed a band who more or less defined the sound of indie music. The band was, of course, Orange Juice. On Postcard Records they released some of the best pop records of the early s, says the Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music, before switching labels. There were great albums: You Canrsquot Hide Your Love Forever, Rip It Up, and AND, of course, we still havenrsquot mentionedSheena Easton, Bronski Beatrsquos Jimmy Somerville, H, the Fire Engines, or Friends Again. Apologies.Orange Juice, and literate singles such as What Presence  and Rip It Up, a top  hit.THE BLUEBELLSldquoFINE exponents of the lsquojangly poprsquo produced by Scottish bands such as Orange Juice and Aztec Camera, notes the Virgin Encyclopedia. Elvis Costello was an early admirer. The singles, Cath, and Sugar Bridge, mysteriously only reached the lower reaches of the charts, but Irsquom Falling was a hit, as was Young At Heart. Cath, revived, was a chart hit in  and in  Young at Heart spent four weeks at number one, courtesy of a car TV advert. There was a fine album, too, in Sisters .AZTEC CAMERARoddy Framersquos excellent band were on Postcard Records before switching to Rough Trade and topping the indie album charts with High Land, Hard Rain . Its highlights included Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter, and We Could Send Letters. The centrepiece of the next album, Kne , produced by Mark Knopfler, was the mesmerising, nine-minute-long title track. The bandrsquos rich seam of form would continue.THE EXPLOITEDPunkrsquos Not Dead was the title of this Edinburgh punk-rock bandrsquos pulverising debut album, in . It made enough of an impact to reach number  in the mainstream album charts. There was a nationwide tour with Discharge, a live album, a second studio album , and a barnstorming performance on ToTPof their  single, Dead Cities. As the bandrsquos website says, without the Exploited, Discharge and GBH, there would be no thrash metal.PAUL QUINN  BOURGIE BOURGIEThe prolic Quinn had been part of a Glasgow band, the Jazzateers, who later became Bourgie Bourgie. As Quinnrsquos website says, they signed to MCA and were touted as the next big thing. Their debut single, Breaking Point, peaked at  in the charts the follow-up, Careless, stalled at . Quinn recorded a couple of singles with Edwyn Collins, Pale Blue Eyes, and Ainrsquot That Always the Way. He also recorded a fine single, One Day, with Vince Clarke, of Yazoo.TVYOUTUBE and Spoty are just two of the places where this intriguing post-punk new wave band, formed by Norman Rodgerand Ally Palmer , can be enjoyed afresh. As Herald reader, Alan from Ayr, notes, they released ldquoa string of glorious singles and a promising album ndash A Thin Red Linendash before splitting. Before doing so, however, they supported the Jam and, at a handful of Scottish gigs, the Rolling Stones. The Excavating the s website describes the album as a ldquopowerful debut that more than holds its own alongside the Bunnymenrsquos Crocodiles and the Teardropsrsquo Kilimanjaro and should rightfully be hailed as a masterpiece of its time.BIG COUNTRYThe  debut album, The Crossing, showcased Big Countryrsquos compelling widescreen sound, gave rise to several great singles, and was nominated for three Grammies. It reached number three in the album charts but the follow-up, Steeltown, did even better, going straight to number one. Subsequent albums, The Seer and Peace In Our Time, were also big sellers. Their top-selling singles included In a Big Country, Chance and Wonderland.ALTERED IMAGESHAPPY Birthday, the best-known song of the Clare Grogan-fronted Altered Imagesrsquo best-known song, may have made John Peelrsquos Festive  in , but the album from which it comesis laden with unsung gems: Legionaire, Faithless, Midnight, Real Toys, A Dayrsquos Wait. Subsequent albums were Pinky Blue and Bite.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis. We have to ensure that future postmasters are not put off by this scandal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj.

Therefore the aim remains ato full-time classroom education as soon as medical guidance allows this.The department has now established a Restart Programme, with both the minister and the department set to consult with a wide range of stakeholders.

Some of the series was filmed at the Co Down studios.According to news website ArmaghI, Brian Johnston, the council#s head of tourism, arts and culture, told a workshop that the Game Of Thrones team were still very positive about the development of the project. Mr Johnston said they were still heavily invested in the project, and while they had hoped to open in October, it had not gone through the planning process yet.The Linen Mills Studios did not respond to a request for comment from the Belfast .Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council yesterday said new documentation in support of the planning applications for a studio tour and a park and ride facility had been lodged on May . The amendments have been advertised in the local Press and consultation has taken place with consultees and neighbours this week, it added.The final decision on the application will rest with the planning and regulatory services committee.Game Of Thrones, filmed at Titanic Studios and a string of other spots in Co Down and the north coast, has been the local film and TV industry#s biggest success story.Before the lockdown it had been a major boost to the tourist sector, with fans from all over the world flocking to locations associated with the series, from Ballintoy Harbour in Co Antrim to Castle Ward in Co Down.

Belfast Harbour Studios was to host the filming of Viking revenge movie The Northman starring Nicole Kidman during the spring.

He is playing about four times a week andhe is not on the course, he is usually on the driving range. He just loves it.Noah, who is tipped to be the next Rory McIlroy, had taken lessons from Rory#s close friend and professional coach Ricky McCormick who was astonished by his ability.Ricky said of the young star last year: I#ve been coaching for  years and he is without doubt the best five-year-old I#ve seen.Videos of Noah hitting the ball  yards when he was just five went viral on Twitter and Instagram where they were viewed over , times in just a few days. His talent caught the eye of several celebrities with boxing champ Carl Frampton retweeting his videos and even Hollywood movie star Kevin Costner commenting on his Instagram post.Noah#s natural swing and ability to drive the ball long distances have also drawn crowds to watch him at his local club.He was just three when he started to play golf in his grandmother#s garden and it was obvious straightaway that he had a gt for the game. Since then there has been no stopping him, until lockdown.His mum Jody adds: He didn#t get to play golf for  weeks and that is the longest time ever. He got new Lynx clubs on the Monday and went to the driving range and we got locked down on the Tuesday so he only got to use them once.My uncle Mark takes him out and he is now a member of Knock Golf Cub.We#ve moved house and now live a stone#s throw from the course and I am delighted he can now get back to doing what he loves.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to ease restrictions for people living aloneBelfast Trust apologises for sending out £k care home bill days after couple die from Covid-Man taken to hospital after falling ft from clf in PortstewartTeaching unions question legality of reopening schools on August Funeral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in Ballymena,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With many retailers reopening tomorrow and over the next few days, I would make an appeal to shoppers to be patient and respectful with shop staff.Substantial operational changes have had to be made for shops to comply with social distancing so it is likely that shoppers will experience increased queuing outside some stores.This is a welcome package of support, particularly the proposed Capital Covid- Recovery Revitalisation scheme for town and city centres. High streets will have to change to accommodate social distancing and it is vital the Executive and local councils work with retailers to ensure shoppers feel safe.We also need much greater flexibility of enforcement of pavement cafe legislation and we should not rule out further pedestrianisation of our town and city centres to support further regeneration moves.Belfast Chamber said the reopening of shopping centres was the final piece in the retail reopening jigsaw.Chief executive Simon Hamilton said: This is further good news for the local retail sector. With all non-essential retail permitted to reopen on Friday, shopping centres were the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle. Today#s announcement means that all of retail can now start trading again. Belfast Chamber expects a considerable number of stores to open in the city centre on Friday and over the coming days. With the vast majority of businesses closed for nearly three months, it is great to see Belfast slowly but surely opening up again.Whilst it is clear that footfall is likely to remain down for some time yet, this is a yet another huge step in the right direction for our members and the city#s economy, and is important in restoring some semblance of normality to our society. In Newry, Chamber President Emma Marmion-Mullen backed the easing of trading restrictions, but called for a stimulus package to help traders face the challenges ahead.It has been a challenging time for local businesses, but we now can slowly begin rebuilding confidence in our local economy, she said. The road to recovery will be challenging. The financial support measures from the UK Government and the Executive have helped businesses to survive and keep people in employment. Equally our businesses have been innovative in how they responded to the challenge of Covid-.As a business community, what we need now is a stimulus package from the NI Executive which will include investment in infrastructure, the improvement of our digital network, support for innovation, and a skills agenda which maximises the talent of our young people.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to ease restrictions for people living aloneBelfast Trust apologises for sending out £k care home bill days after couple die from Covid-Man taken to hospital after falling ft from clf in PortstewartTeaching unions question legality of reopening schools on August Funeral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in Ballymena,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rail campaign group ‘Into The West’ said it is ‘surprised and disappointed’ with the announcement that ‘yet another feasibility study’ is now required before the third and final phase of work to modernise the Derry-Coleraine railway line can progress. On June , Infrastructure Minister Nichola announced that she wants to get phase  of the project ‘back on track’. SDLP MLA for Foyle Mark H Durkan welcomed news of a ‘feasibility study’. However, Into the West believe another feasibility study to be unnecessary and have demanded answers from the Infrastructure minister. googletag.cmd.push The group said theof Stormont in January gave renewed hope that this ‘vital project’ for the north-west would be put back on track again. “The Phase  work will cost poundm – a relatively small sum in infrastructure terms - and expectations were raised that it would be included in this year’s DFI budget,” Into The West Co-Chair Steve Bradley said. “It therefore came as a shock and disappointment to rail campaigners when today’s budget announcement gave no indication of when the Phase  work would take place at all, and instead called for yet another feasibility study into it.” googletag.cmd.push Phase  work involves replacing the track between Downhill and Eglinton, and installing a new ‘passing loop’ for trains. According to Into the West, once complete it will shave up to  minutes off the existing journey time - and more importantly double capacity on the line. That would enable the introduction of a half-hourly service to Belfast, and the possibility of express trains to Belfast with journey times below mins. The passing loop also creates the opportunity to locate it strategically to enable a new station at City of Derry Airport or Ballykelly – either now or in the future. Into The West Co-Chair Steve Bradley commented: “Phase  is the key to improving rail in the north-west, reversing decades of east-west transport disparity here, and equipping our region to tackle congestion and climate change. “The Minister has spoken repeatedly about improving public transport, enabling greener choices and addressing Northern Ireland’s regional imbalance – all of which gave us hope that this essential work would finally be funded. To be told instead that the only thing happening is yet another feasibility study is unacceptable. “What has changed regarding the scope of this project to warrant another study  And why has the need for one never been mentioned before now  “The conclusion to draw from this is that there is a risk Phase  may never happen at all now. Which would leave Derry with a lower standard of rail service than every town and village east of the Bann receives on the same line.” ‘KICKING THE CAN’ Into The West is ‘grateful’ that Minister Mallon has mentioned Phase  in her budget and understands the tough choices she has to make with restricted resources. But they also fear this is ‘just another delaying tactic from DfI which declared its opposition’ to Phase  by cancelling the work when Stormont was suspended. “We had hoped a new Minister would appreciate the signicance of this project to the north-west and stand up to Civil Service negativity about it. In the absence of a credible explanation for why a new study is required, we must conclude that it is just kicking the can down the road. “It feels like the rail equivalent of seeking endless business cases for Magee expansion, without ever actually delivering on it”. Prior to this announcement Into The West had a meeting scheduled with the Minster for next week to discuss a range of rail issues facing the north-west. The organisation says it will use that opportunity to seek an explanation for the new feasibility study, and to continue to press the case for Phase  to happen as soon as possible. “The Derry-Belfast railway line is the busiest single track route in the UK and Ireland – carrying over three million passengers a year. It is unacceptable to leave such a popular route with le-expired track so degraded that it requires multiple speed restrictions and continual monitoring of its condition. “The entire North-west is united in support of the Phase  works. Derry and Strabane Council has policy demanding it, the cross-border North West Regional Development Group have endorsed it, and thousands of people have signed a petition calling for it. Because nothing can be improved for rail in the west until this work is completed. “We will therefore be demanding answers from the Minister as to why this long-delayed project now needs to jump through yet more hoops, and when it will finally take place. “It is not enough to simply talk about climate change, increasing public transport and addressing regional imbalance – you have to take the decisions that will actually deliver for it beyond Belfast,” Mr Bradley concluded.

When Dungiven woman Bridie Ward sent us a s image of men lined up by soldiers outside a bar on Belfastrsquos New Lodge Road, it begged further investigation. Liam Tunney caught up with her to find out its background.The sight of men spread-eagled on the wall of a bar while soldiers search a premise is one that evokes strong emotions in this country. The Starry Plough sat halfway down the New Lodge Road in north Belfast, but was owned and run for years by Dungiven man Jim O’Kane. Although a staunchly Republican area, Jim’s sister Bridie recalled a mixed crowd at the bar in its earlier days. “There was a mixed crowd away years ago, it was a bar where everyone would meet up. People from Tiger’s Bay would have come in there before the Troubles started,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Before the Troubles, the sea men, or the dockers, would have been in the bar. They were away at sea for maybe six weeks at a time and they had all this money so they spent it in there. “At the beginning, he made a lot of money in the bar, because when he bought it, there were always darts matches in it.” By the time the Troubles began to poison the city, though, the bar was singled out on a few occasions by the British Army. ‘Times of Troubles’, by Andrew Saunders, describes how, on one of those occasions, the bar was raided following a period of rioting. googletag.cmd.push “On the night of  May one platoon went into the Starry Plough to make arrests,” it read. “They removed thirty people for questioning and felt sufficiently threatened by the crowd which had gathered outside that they fired rubber bullets.” The bar has been rebuilt and is now named The Lodge. The Starry Plough’s owner Jim was a Republican Labour councillor in the city and his position attracted unwanted attention that regularly escalated into a physical threat. He twice survived attempts on his le, attempts that tragically resulted in the deaths of two companions, including a doorman at the bar in the s. North Belfast historian, Joe Baker, recalled the aftermath of the bomb in an article he wrote for the North Belfast News. “I remember my mother running to it screaming after it was bombed by Loyalists,” it read. “She knew that my Dad had been in it but fortunately he had left some time before to head off to another bar.” Another attack, in , on Jim’s home in Cedar Avenue resulted in the death of Bridget Breen, a -year-old woman who was babysitting for the O’Kane family. “Jim lived up there most of his le and was married up there. They had a hard time during the Troubles, it was tough in the s up there,” she recalled. Jim OKane outside the Starry Plough in the aftermath of the bomb that killed a doorman. “During the Troubles, they planted a bomb in the entrance [of the bar] and it blew up. He survived, but the door man was killed. “He also lost two homes. He lived in a beautul house, but they burned him out. They threw a firebomb in and the four boys were very lucky to survive. “The boys were sleeping one night and there was a woman who used to babysit for him. Josie, his we, was going down that evening to help out in the bar. “The phone rang a couple of times and the first time before she went out, it rang and they said, in an English tongue, ‘Oh sorry, we got the wrong number’, so they must have been looking for my brother. “He would have come home at night to have his tea or dinner and went back to the bar. She was ready to go out again and the call came through again, but they put the phone down on her. “She went on to the bar and the babysitter came in. It was one of those old houses, a big red brick house, with a front room like a sitting room at the front and a big long hall. “They threw the duffle bag with the bomb in through the front room, breaking the window. “The babysitter panicked and ran out the front door. It was the big, huge, oak door that was on the front and it fell on her and killed her. “The boys survived because the house was so big that it was just the front that got demolished and they were sleeping away at the back.” Jim died in the s, but an off-licence bearing the family name remains in place on the New Lodge Road. The effects of the bomb attacks and threats on his le left a lasting impression on the Dungiven man. “He never really got over the babysitter or the doorman,” said Bridie. “After that, when he was going down to the bar, and especially coming home at night, he always made sure he checked his car, in case they planted something on it. It was a scary time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When Dungiven woman Bridie Ward sent us a s image of men lined up by soldiers outside a bar on Belfastrsquos New Lodge Road, it begged further investigation. Liam Tunney caught up with her to find out its background.The sight of men spread-eagled on the wall of a bar while soldiers search a premise is one that evokes strong emotions in this country. The Starry Plough sat halfway down the New Lodge Road in north Belfast, but was owned and run for years by Dungiven man Jim O’Kane. Although a staunchly Republican area, Jim’s sister Bridie recalled a mixed crowd at the bar in its earlier days. “There was a mixed crowd away years ago, it was a bar where everyone would meet up. People from Tiger’s Bay would have come in there before the Troubles started,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Before the Troubles, the sea men, or the dockers, would have been in the bar. They were away at sea for maybe six weeks at a time and they had all this money so they spent it in there. “At the beginning, he made a lot of money in the bar, because when he bought it, there were always darts matches in it.” By the time the Troubles began to poison the city, though, the bar was singled out on a few occasions by the British Army. ‘Times of Troubles’, by Andrew Saunders, describes how, on one of those occasions, the bar was raided following a period of rioting. googletag.cmd.push “On the night of  May one platoon went into the Starry Plough to make arrests,” it read. “They removed thirty people for questioning and felt sufficiently threatened by the crowd which had gathered outside that they fired rubber bullets.” The bar has been rebuilt and is now named The Lodge. The Starry Plough’s owner Jim was a Republican Labour councillor in the city and his position attracted unwanted attention that regularly escalated into a physical threat. He twice survived attempts on his le, attempts that tragically resulted in the deaths of two companions, including a doorman at the bar in the s. North Belfast historian, Joe Baker, recalled the aftermath of the bomb in an article he wrote for the North Belfast News. “I remember my mother running to it screaming after it was bombed by Loyalists,” it read. “She knew that my Dad had been in it but fortunately he had left some time before to head off to another bar.” Another attack, in , on Jim’s home in Cedar Avenue resulted in the death of Bridget Breen, a -year-old woman who was babysitting for the O’Kane family. “Jim lived up there most of his le and was married up there. They had a hard time during the Troubles, it was tough in the s up there,” she recalled. Jim OKane outside the Starry Plough in the aftermath of the bomb that killed a doorman. “During the Troubles, they planted a bomb in the entrance [of the bar] and it blew up. He survived, but the door man was killed. “He also lost two homes. He lived in a beautul house, but they burned him out. They threw a firebomb in and the four boys were very lucky to survive. “The boys were sleeping one night and there was a woman who used to babysit for him. Josie, his we, was going down that evening to help out in the bar. “The phone rang a couple of times and the first time before she went out, it rang and they said, in an English tongue, ‘Oh sorry, we got the wrong number’, so they must have been looking for my brother. “He would have come home at night to have his tea or dinner and went back to the bar. She was ready to go out again and the call came through again, but they put the phone down on her. “She went on to the bar and the babysitter came in. It was one of those old houses, a big red brick house, with a front room like a sitting room at the front and a big long hall. “They threw the duffle bag with the bomb in through the front room, breaking the window. “The babysitter panicked and ran out the front door. It was the big, huge, oak door that was on the front and it fell on her and killed her. “The boys survived because the house was so big that it was just the front that got demolished and they were sleeping away at the back.” Jim died in the s, but an off-licence bearing the family name remains in place on the New Lodge Road. The effects of the bomb attacks and threats on his le left a lasting impression on the Dungiven man. “He never really got over the babysitter or the doorman,” said Bridie. “After that, when he was going down to the bar, and especially coming home at night, he always made sure he checked his car, in case they planted something on it. It was a scary time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  on the bridge were vandalised in July  and have still to be replaced. The Department of Infrstructure , which is responsible for the maintenance of the bridge, said in October of last year that it had planned to have new  in place by the end of November. However, that work has not been carried out. Last years vandalism was the latest in a series of attacks on the glass  on the Peace Bridge, which opened in  and is used by hundreds of people each day. googletag.cmd.push The delay in repairing the damage caused by the latest attack was discussed yesterday at a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. During the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the council had recently received a letter from the Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon which stated that the repair work was to be carried out on the bridge. However, he said that the work had not yet been carried out and asked that another letter be sent to the Minister. He said that they should not let the Peace Bridge repairs slip off the agenda. googletag.cmd.push A council officer told the meeting that she would follow the issue up with the Divisional Roads Manager as it was their department who would be undertaking the bridge repairs. The officer said she was aware that they had appointed a contractor to carry out the work before the coronavirus crisis, and that it may have been the pandemic which had delayed the work being carried out. She said thatcouncillors agreed she would contact the Divisional Roads Manager to find out what the situation was. The officer added thatthere was any issue or delay, then the council could then write to the Minister about the bridge repairs.

Both outgoing mayor Sean Bateson and his successor Mark Fielding described the meetings to date as ‘successful’, but some constituents have taken to social media to voice their frustration. At present, members of the public can request access to the online meetings through a member of the council staff, but some councillors have called for the process to be made easier. Cllr Kathleen McGurk has called for the meetings to be made more widely available. “I am confident the technology exists to open meetings up to the public and hope to see it rolled out in the very near future,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “The draft protocol called for any member of the public wishing to access council meetings to register their request with the Democratic Services team and a link would then be provided for access to the meeting. “I argued that this created unnecessary barriers to the public and meetings should simply be broadcast via a link from the council’s website. “This would open up council business for greater scrutiny from the public and perhaps attract a new audience for council meetings.

A student at St Patrick’s College, Maghera, Luca’s story ‘Business Crocodile’ was selected as a finalist in the - category of the BBC’s ‘Two Minute Tales’ competition. Luca’s father, Michael, said his son was taking the achievement in his stride. “He doesn’t like the limelight, but he’s quietly delighted in himself,” he told the County Derry Post. “Luca is laid back, very laid back, and he hates any sort of people looking at him. He would be quite happy for someone to say, ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’ and move on. googletag.cmd.push “He’s very non-assuming. Even when he scores goals in football, he doesn’t make a fuss.” Michael suggested Luca enter the competition after hearing about it on the Nuala McKeever show, and when the school added it to their homework tasks, it was the perfect fit. The Year  student’s love for animals formed the basis of his story, and although very imaginative, it has taken this success to spur him into action. “It’s come out of nowhere really, but he is full of imagination and he comes up with these quirky things from time to time. His teachers, Ms McAteer and Ms Laverty, have to take the credit. googletag.cmd.push “This has given him a boost and he’s started jotting down new characters and thinking of new stories on the back of it. “His mind is an encyclopaedia. He could rhyme off reams of animals and their Latin names as well. He reads about them and the dferent species, so the character probably came from that.” For now, the content of the story is a closely guarded secret around Maghera, but it will not remain that way for long. The finalists will now have their stories brought to le by actors and broadcast on The Lynette Fay Show on BBC Radio Ulster at the end of June.

Emma McCann, from Moneymore, raised over pound, for Cancer Focus NI after taking on the mammoth task and said she was ‘humbled’ by the donations. “People stepped up to the mark and the live feed on Facebook really made a dference. I could see when the donations were coming through,” she told the County Derry Post. “I just didn’t know what way it was going to go. The majority of people are furloughed from their work, they’re worried about their jobs. googletag.cmd.push “They don’t have an awful lot of money and there’s a huge amount of worthy events and challenges going on at the minute. “There were even a few others locally that day, and people only have a certain amount of money to give but they were fantastic.” As well as being thrilled with the amount of money raised for the charity, Emma says the support she received from friends, family and neighbours. A small crowd had gathered as she reached the last leg of her challenge, something she says took her by surprise. “I knew nothing about that! I just thought with what had been going on that I was on my own, just me, John and the dog,” said Emma. googletag.cmd.push “I couldn’t get over that my friends all decided to come and support me. I needed it. They all arrived during the last km or thereabouts. Emma had set herself a target of  hours for the km cycle, but, spurred on by the support, and a healthy competitive instinct, he managed to beat her target. “I had given myself five hours and was absolutely chuffed to have been able to do it in four hours, twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds,” she said. “I was tootling along at an average of about -km per hour but I’m actually quite competitive. “I looked at the stopwatch and thought, ‘I can do this in about : or so’ and I pushed it hard the last km and I got there.” Donations for the challenge can still be made by visiting Emma’s Just Giving page at Emma’s Lockdown Cycle km.

A number of complaints had been raised about the booking system put in place following the easement of coronavirus restrictions. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said some constituents had experienced dficulty when trying to make a same-day booking, but moves have since been made to improve the service. “I asked the Environmental Services Director to improve the current system to ensure there are less issues when trying to book a slot including provision same day booking,” said Cllr McGurk. “I very much welcome the improvements that the council team have now implemented and praise should be given to the quick response to the complaints. googletag.cmd.push “The new online booking systems which is being rolled out should streamline the service for all users.” The online system, which will facilitate same-day booking, will be trialled at sites in Coleraine and Limavady this week, with the council hoping to roll it out to all sites within a fortnight. The number of slots has also been increased to allow for four vehicles every ten minutes, with a view to increasing it to six vehicles this week. In the meantime, the council has increased the number of operators taking bookings to seven at centres that do not yet have the online booking system in place. googletag.cmd.push “I appreciate there have been frustrations caused by the booking system and some have called for its removal entirely,” said Cllr McGurk “However it is essential that we maintain it for the meantime to avoid the long queues and congestion seen in other Council areas. “It is also worth noting that since the introduction of the booking system, most council recycling centres are working to full capacity with slots being entirely filled for the following day. “If this wasn’t managed correctly it would lead to peak usage times which would have the potential to overwhelm staff at the centres and cause traffic issues. “Whilst this may not have been as likely a scenario in smaller recycling centres, it was important that the same approach was taken to all centres across the council area.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

Director of Programmes at North West Migrant’s Forum , Lilian Seenoi-Barr, claimed that racism is not a distant enemy, but one that exists in Derry which must be challenged immediately. She said that to realise that change, will mean overhauling society from top to bottom. On a community level, Mrs Seenoi-Barr believes people must have tough conversations around the dinner table and confront racism when they see or hear it. She said the video of George Floyd being killed by a US police officer provoked emotions in people from BAME communities in Derry about their own experiences of racism. googletag.cmd.push NWMF provides advice and support services to BAME communities living in the city. The group aims to promote ersity and good community relations and runs youth clubs. NWMF organised the Black Lives Matters rally in Derry on Saturday. Political leaders and police had appealed for the protest to be cancelled due to public safety concerns over the Coronavirus pandemic. Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that there was ‘great demand’ from within BAME communities to express their feelings. Meetings were held to discuss how the event could go ahead safely with public health at the forefront of their minds. “We wanted people to feel comfortable about attending a public rally, we gave advice about social distancing, to come with your own PPE, butyou couldn’t access any we had plenty,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “It was a collective community response to what happened, and our community wanted to raise awareness of what is happening here, and make clear that this is not just an American issue. “It’s an issue that also affects us here in the North, here in this city, so let’s not be side-tracked by people who say this is an American issue or ‘all le matters’. “Absolutely, all le matters but the truth is that black lives are in danger, it’s like a house on fire. “It’s like ignoring the fire that is burning in someone’s house and yours is not burning but you say ‘all lives matter’.” Prior to Saturday’s event, the police called to Mrs Seenoi-Barr’s home where, she said, a caution was issued for ‘incitement and encouragement’ of an illegal rally. “How can the right to hold a peaceful protest and the freedom of expression, which is a fundamental human right, be an illegal gathering,” she said. “How was it that the event held prior to that on Friday wasn’t illegal  How is that when everyone went to beaches, where hundreds of people gathered, not illegal  “Evenit was not organised those people pre-meditated going to the beach.” The rally faced opposition from many people in the city who feel that during the current pandemic is not the right time to hold a march. In response, Mrs Seenoi-Barr,said: “There is no right time to fight a pandemic, you fight the pandemic when it exists. “I accept the coronavirus pandemic is the biggest health crisis this country has ever faced in this generation and it is posing a risk to each and every one of us. “But what I would like to say is that racism is a health pandemic that has been in existence for centuries, it is deeply enshrined in our society and it is right for us to respond to racism. “Because in our communities, there is no bigger threat than the other, coronavirus is killing our people, so is racism.” In , Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that migrant children and their parents were being subjected to racist abuse in the city. She claimed that Saturday’s rally proves that it still exists. “The overwhelming text messages that I’m receiving from parents who say that the event made their children feel like they have support because over the years they have been attacked, racially abused in school and the schools are not helping. “They felt that was their moment and now they see that the community stands behind them. “People who were not able to come out of their houses. Parents have told me, ‘my children don’t leave the bedroom after school, they don’t go anywhere because they’re petried of being called names on the street or being racially bullied’. “But when they heard that we were going to be protesting, -year-olds were getting their parents to come out because they felt they had hope. “Those are people who have been traumatised, living with the pain of racism and injustices that exist within our society. “Let’s not kid ourselves that racism is only an American issue, it is here, and the event on Saturday demonstrated that.” She said the frustration and anger of migrants who have felt the ‘profound racial inequalities’ that exist in this country made them come out. “And honestly, I would be failing in my job as someone entrusted by those people to represent them, support them, and provide them a ,I did not respond to their cause. “At the moment the wrong thing to say is to say nothing, and the wrong thing to do is to do nothing. “Silence in this time is criminal,” Mrs Barr added. The number of people living in Derry from BAME communities is unknown because there is no ethnic monitoring in Northern Ireland, which Mrs Barr said is part of ‘systematic racism’. “Racism is not only about a man being killed on camera. “It is also the fact that we cannot access services, the fact that we are told we are very few in this community and maybe that is why we have no representation. “It is the unconscious biases that exist within the education system, the housing system and the civil service were there is only .% representation. “We have a majority of people who work in the NHS but how many of them are decision makers. They are entrusted with lives but are not entrusted with making decisions.” Hate crime legislation that exists is not fit for purpose, Mrs Barr believes, and should be brought in line with that in England and Wales. She said that the education system must be reformed so that the curriculum includes racism, equality, ersity and inclusion. “Knowledge is our weapon, and it is also our protection,” she added.

Shaking up the Derry senior championship isnt an exact science. However, after the recent figuresindicatingthe lack of players not coming through to senior inter-county level, I thought I would get a pen and copious amounts of paper out, to devise a isional element to the countys golden goose – the race for the John McLaughlin Cup. I have often penned on these pages how dficult a job the CCC have and especially in a dual county. Now I am going to rip up the championship and start afresh. This week, the format of any championship that will take place this year will be up for debate. The group stages are going to be pondered over to get club players more games. googletag.cmd.push My study is one for the  season and on the basis that this year never happened. All the facts and figures come from last season and the years before. I remember trying to chat with an Austin Stacks’supporter one night in Portlaoises Maldron Hotel about the ins and outs of the Kerry championship. At the end of the day,the standard of football is to improve, then we need to get more of it. It was the wee small hours of the night, Slaughtneils clash with Kieran Donaghys side was getting closer. It wasnt the few pints we were hovering over that caused the confusion, it was just a dficult thing to decipher. googletag.cmd.push For Derrys version, I am stripping away any connection between league and championship. Thats the first point, in the hope that over the next decade, theleague can continue regardless of county games. At the end of the day,the standard of football is to improve, then we need to get more of it. PLAN A For Plan A, I am basing the Derry SFC on having  senior club teams and three isional teams. For the  senior clubs I have selected on the basis of looking back at the last five years of the championship. Slaughtneil, Coleraine and Magherafelt are in there, as previous winners. Add in Loup, Ballinascreen, Glen and Lavey as teams who have contested finals. Bellaghy, Ballinderry, Greenlough and Banagher make the cut, having reached at least a semi-final. To get the tally up to , I have tapped into the  league placings. Swatragh, in third place, make the cut and the next highest ranked team, in thplace, is Dungiven. The rest of the clubs will ply their trade in the intermediate and junior championships. This is where things change. A few people told me I was crazy to start delving into this, but so is standing still and not exploring. But sure, without the draw of any live action, its an interesting delve. The natural break in the three isional teams would be north and south Derry and the city. On the face of it, this wont work. The city teams just wouldnt be strong enough, so I have renamed it as Foyle and drafted in Claudy, Slaughtmanus and Faughanvale. Players from these clubs would be key players on St Columbs Derry teams and itwould leave the following selection. FOYLE OAKS : Ardmore, Doire Colmcille, Doire Trasna, Sean Dolans, Steelstown, Faughanvale, Claudy and Slaughtmanus. That would leave North Derry with nine to pick from, including  senior champions Glenullin and Foreglen, the most consistent intermediate side of the last decade, to form the backbone. Add in the likes of Lee Moore, Gary Keane, Tiarnan Woods and goalkeeper Oran Hartin. NORTH DERRY : Ballerin, Craigbane, Drum, Drumsurn, Foreglen, Glack, Glenullin, Limavady, and Magilligan. So that takes us down past the Ponderosa and over that imaginary boundary between north and southDerry. Kilrea and Newbridge will form the basis for the South Derry team. The Pearses have been in the senior final in the last decade, with Newbridge having laid a foundation of youth for the future. Goalkeeper Aaron Cassidy of Ballymaguigan would be a serious addition. The Keenans in Castledawson, Patrick Feeney and Emmet Crozier from Moneymore, not forgetting Eunan McElhennon and Iarlaith Donaghy. SOUTH DERRY : Ballymaguigan, Castledawson, Desertmartin, Kilrea, Lissan, Moneymore and Newbridge. There we go. Easy wasnt it. On to the small print. The intermediate winners are promoted to the senior championship for the following year. For relegation, the eight teams that dont make the senior quarter-final, their championship form from the last five years is taken into consideration. Wins, draws and score dference all collated. The two lowest performing teams go into a play-off, with the loser getting the chop. Since the isional teams wont have any championship history, they will be exempt from relegation for five years to see how it beds in. At that point, the fuller evaluation of the project will have taken place. The dficult situation will be fitting it all in. So senior games would be played on dferent weekends. And with dual players needing to be fitted in, Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Paddy Henry, Johnny ODwyer and the likes. With the club leagues being detached, they can start earlier and with moreclubswithout county players as it wont affect their championship stance. What happens South Derry beat Coleraine in the  county final. They wont be able to go into Ulster, so in that case the league winners would advance. Or maybe, the winners of the Larkin and Kerlin Cups play off in a decider as a plan B to pick an alternative county champion. PLAN B While I was at it. I picked a much more radical plan B, that would see eight senior teams and eight isional teams, like inKerry. Just to prove I was listening that night in the Maldron. Fromchampionship form, the senior teams would be: Slaughtneil, Coleraine, Ballinderry, Loup, Ballinascreen, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt. And, from looking at the  league pairings, intermediate and junior would be as follows. INTERMEDIATE : Bellaghy, Dungiven, Banagher, Greenlough, Swatragh, Claudy, Newbridge, Kilrea, Foreglen, Drumsurn, Faughanvale, Steelstown, Glenullin, Castledawson, Ballymaguigan and Limavady. JUNIOR : Slaughtmanus, Lissan, Doire Trasna, Ballerin, Desertmartin, Glack, Craigbane, Magilligan, Drum, Sean Dolans, Doire Colmcille, Moneymore and Ardmore. Jumping clean off the page is the likes of Bellaghy,  times senior winnersand Swatragh, third in the league last year, playing at intermediate level. The sticking point would be the loss of senior status by some clubs,whowould find it very hard to get promoted back to senior level. Relegation, promotion and qualication for Ulster would follow the same pattern and have the same obstacles as plan A. Its hard to see this one ever getting the time of day, but sure it gives the Sideline Views version of the CCC something to compare. Both are dferent, both will be hard to sell, but wouldnt it be great to get some proper dialogue on something to widenthe base of players for a strategic plan at inter-county level. NEXT WEEK: We will reveal the ious team selections from Sideline Views preferred Plan A option and how a possible championship draw could pan out. RELATED - Spreading the net wider. More...

Shaking up the Derry senior championship isnt an exact science. However, after the recent figuresindicatingthe lack of players not coming through to senior inter-county level, I thought I would get a pen and copious amounts of paper out, to devise a isional element to the countys golden goose – the race for the John McLaughlin Cup. I have often penned on these pages how dficult a job the CCC have and especially in a dual county. Now I am going to rip up the championship and start afresh. This week, the format of any championship that will take place this year will be up for debate. The group stages are going to be pondered over to get club players more games. googletag.cmd.push My study is one for the  season and on the basis that this year never happened. All the facts and figures come from last season and the years before. I remember trying to chat with an Austin Stacks’supporter one night in Portlaoises Maldron Hotel about the ins and outs of the Kerry championship. At the end of the day,the standard of football is to improve, then we need to get more of it. It was the wee small hours of the night, Slaughtneils clash with Kieran Donaghys side was getting closer. It wasnt the few pints we were hovering over that caused the confusion, it was just a dficult thing to decipher. googletag.cmd.push For Derrys version, I am stripping away any connection between league and championship. Thats the first point, in the hope that over the next decade, theleague can continue regardless of county games. At the end of the day,the standard of football is to improve, then we need to get more of it. PLAN A For Plan A, I am basing the Derry SFC on having  senior club teams and three isional teams. For the  senior clubs I have selected on the basis of looking back at the last five years of the championship. Slaughtneil, Coleraine and Magherafelt are in there, as previous winners. Add in Loup, Ballinascreen, Glen and Lavey as teams who have contested finals. Bellaghy, Ballinderry, Greenlough and Banagher make the cut, having reached at least a semi-final. To get the tally up to , I have tapped into the  league placings. Swatragh, in third place, make the cut and the next highest ranked team, in thplace, is Dungiven. The rest of the clubs will ply their trade in the intermediate and junior championships. This is where things change. A few people told me I was crazy to start delving into this, but so is standing still and not exploring. But sure, without the draw of any live action, its an interesting delve. The natural break in the three isional teams would be north and south Derry and the city. On the face of it, this wont work. The city teams just wouldnt be strong enough, so I have renamed it as Foyle and drafted in Claudy, Slaughtmanus and Faughanvale. Players from these clubs would be key players on St Columbs Derry teams and itwould leave the following selection. FOYLE OAKS : Ardmore, Doire Colmcille, Doire Trasna, Sean Dolans, Steelstown, Faughanvale, Claudy and Slaughtmanus. That would leave North Derry with nine to pick from, including  senior champions Glenullin and Foreglen, the most consistent intermediate side of the last decade, to form the backbone. Add in the likes of Lee Moore, Gary Keane, Tiarnan Woods and goalkeeper Oran Hartin. NORTH DERRY : Ballerin, Craigbane, Drum, Drumsurn, Foreglen, Glack, Glenullin, Limavady, and Magilligan. So that takes us down past the Ponderosa and over that imaginary boundary between north and southDerry. Kilrea and Newbridge will form the basis for the South Derry team. The Pearses have been in the senior final in the last decade, with Newbridge having laid a foundation of youth for the future. Goalkeeper Aaron Cassidy of Ballymaguigan would be a serious addition. The Keenans in Castledawson, Patrick Feeney and Emmet Crozier from Moneymore, not forgetting Eunan McElhennon and Iarlaith Donaghy. SOUTH DERRY : Ballymaguigan, Castledawson, Desertmartin, Kilrea, Lissan, Moneymore and Newbridge. There we go. Easy wasnt it. On to the small print. The intermediate winners are promoted to the senior championship for the following year. For relegation, the eight teams that dont make the senior quarter-final, their championship form from the last five years is taken into consideration. Wins, draws and score dference all collated. The two lowest performing teams go into a play-off, with the loser getting the chop. Since the isional teams wont have any championship history, they will be exempt from relegation for five years to see how it beds in. At that point, the fuller evaluation of the project will have taken place. The dficult situation will be fitting it all in. So senior games would be played on dferent weekends. And with dual players needing to be fitted in, Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Paddy Henry, Johnny ODwyer and the likes. With the club leagues being detached, they can start earlier and with moreclubswithout county players as it wont affect their championship stance. What happens South Derry beat Coleraine in the  county final. They wont be able to go into Ulster, so in that case the league winners would advance. Or maybe, the winners of the Larkin and Kerlin Cups play off in a decider as a plan B to pick an alternative county champion. PLAN B While I was at it.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

Crops lay flat in the fields from the constant pounding of the rain. As a family of farmers it was an extremely dficult time.ldquoIn between the deluges we managed to scramble our way to the first Irish Senior Cup final and emerged victorious mdash a rare moment of sunshine that year.For Paul, then a teenager still at school, the memories of  years ago are still vivid.ldquoIt was my first year in the st XI, playing alongside my father and Alfie. They were  and  years young at that time and still playing well.ldquoIn fact, the following year, in the same competition, I sat in amazement watching Alfie blast a ton against a Bangor with John Elder leading the attack, having opened the bowling for Ireland against Australia earlier that summer in front of , people at Downpatrick.ldquoAnyway, Alfie smashed nine huge sixes, all clearing the Strangford Road end. This was at a spritely age of .ldquoAll of a sudden I realised the legendary tales of Alfiersquos big hitting were true. Dad always said he hit the ball much further than anyone . That innings remains the most memorable I have seen from a Downpatrick player. saw the ICU as it was then bring in bowl-outs to decide washed-out contests, with all  players trying to hit the stumps in a shoot-out.In the first round Downpatrick faced Leinster and of the  players who aimed, only one was successful mdash the aforementioned Alfie.Downpatrick had reached the final after a famous win in the lionrsquos den of Donemana, with Brian Ferris and Jim Patterson smashing unbeaten fties in an emphatic victory.ldquoThere was a lot of publicity surrounding the Irish Senior Cup which at that time was sponsored by Schweppes, said Paul.ldquoIn the years that followed, just like the inter-pros played for the Guinness Cup, everyone simply called the competition lsquoThe Schweppesrsquo. In more recent times, the Ulster Cup was known as lsquoThe Clubturfrsquo.ldquoBefore the final, BBC TV sent a crew down to interview some of us, and ironically record us bowling at the stumps. It was still raining. It took us ages to hit the stumpshellipI got abuse at school.ldquoNeedless to say, the final was washed out without a bowl bowled and the miserable summer continued. It was desperately disappointing after a week of huge anticipation.The toss for the venue of the replay was conducted over the phone between the two captains, Ian Shields and Derek McCann.Downpatrick won and the replay was scheduled for midweek, Wednesday, September , and North Downrsquos Robin Haire recalls the conditions werenrsquot really fit for cricket.ldquoDownpatrick had actual puddles of water on parts of outfield, he recalled. ldquoMy abiding memory of that final was the spray of the water when you hit it along the ground.ldquoIt was totally unplayable, but the authorities wanted it played and out of the way. Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three. I was a very nervous  year-old when I arrived at the wicket after they had put on . Keith was going well and I just needed to stay in.ldquoAnyway, desperate to get off the mark, I predicted Robin Haire was going to bowl me a long hop. I was right back on the stumps, ready to smash it, when he fired in a quicker ball which crashed into my ankles in front of middle. Out for a duck in the All-Ireland Cup final. I was beyond devastated as cricket was everything to me.ldquoWe eventually won by six wickets as our experienced side adopted a safety-first attitude, taking no risks. Derek McCann lted the famous trophy and Downpatrick were All-Ireland champions.There were to be no champagne celebrations for the teenager though.ldquoUnfortunately, I was too young to down a couple of beers, so it was straight back home after the final for Dad and I, two All-Ireland champions.Six years later, Downpatrick would secure the trophy for the second time in one of the most thrilling encounters ever, overcoming North by three runs.There was to be no personal glory though for Paul Linehan as he missed out on the chance of redemption.ldquoThe disappointment of making a duck remains as I was never to play in another All-Ireland final, having been injured for the  victory, he said.ldquoHowever, all these years later, my  medal is still very much a prized possession..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C June 10%2C 2000  ","story":"TYRELLA mdash Tyrella beach has retained a prestigious European award which recognises the quality of the local tourist facility.The beach is one of eight in the province to receive the highly sought after Blue Flag Award, the highest possible recognition for cleanliness.Down Council chiefs are delighted Tyrella has once again been recognised for its quality, and the amount of effort they put into maintaining it, in the annual Tidy Britain Group awards.The awards were officially handed over on Monday along with the prestigious Blue Flag which will continue to fly high over Tyrella for the next  months.The beach was rigorously examined in an unannounced inspection by a  of European experts who focused their attention on cleanliness and the environmental management of Tyrella.Council official Leonard Lawson said everyone was delighted their efforts have again been recognised.ldquoThe award also recognises the councilrsquos effort to manage the beach, provide information points, educational material and detailed displays in the beach centre, he said.ldquoThe water quality is also critical to ensure Blue Flag status is retailed and the council aims to continue to work hard to maintain its high standards.NEWCASTLE mdash Armed robbers made off with over pound, in cash yesterday morning after a hold-up at a Newcastle bank.The three masked men burst into the Northern Bank in Main Street at .am and order everyone inside to co-operate.

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high demand.Local SDLP MLA Colin McGrath also welcomed the plannersrsquo approval.He said: ldquoThe housing development at the old Downe site has been a protracted and drawn out process.ldquoHaving been in regular contact with Clanmil to see what were the outstanding issues holding this development back to hear that council planners are to approve the next stage of the development at long last is very

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

You can be open, or you can have government’, would have felt at home in StormontMore than two years ago the Information Commissioner’s Officesaid that it would audit Northern Ireland departments’ compliance with the Freedom of InformationAct after widespread evidence of how civil servants and political figures had covered up key government decisions.In  the Head of the Civil Service, David Sterling, told the public inquiry into the RHI scandal that civil servants had consciously and deliberately not recorded some decisions which they believed may be embarrassing in order to evade the FoI law.He said the two parties were “sensitive to criticism” and that officials had “got into the habit of not recording all meetings”.At the time the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who polices the openness legislation, wrote to Mr Sterling to express her “deep concern” at what had emerged and warn him that she would be auditing his departments’ compliance. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...However, more than two years later that audit has still not even started – and there is no date for when it is likely to get under way.The news comes after it emerged on the Nolan Show that Executive departments have for more than ten years been operating a system whereby emails are automatically deleted after three months unless an official makes a conscious decision to retain them.The Executive Office said that retaining lots of emails “creates a burden on the information systems and increases data storage charges” and it was the responsibility of inidual officials to decide what to retain.However, Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said he was alarmed by the revelation and added: “If we are to take any lessons from the RHI debacle, it’s that scrutiny can help prevent future scandals.”The News Letter asked the ICOit had concerns about what Stormont was doing, whether it believed that material ‘deleted’ after three months should still be released in response to FoI requestsit is still held on other government servers, and whether it had gone ahead with the audit of Northern Ireland departments. The body’s head of regions, Ken Macdonald said: “Records can help to tell us why a decision was made, who made it and when. They are necessary to create confidence in any decision making process, to promote accountability and transparency, and to allow others to very what has been done.“We encourage all public authorities to ensure that their record keeping reflects both legal requirements and business needs and is given the priority it deserves.“We advised the NICS on the need to improve records management across the departments. It has developed new procedures which could only be fully implemented after the re-establishment of an Executive.“It is still our intention to undertake an audit but this will only be done after sufficient time for practices to be fully embedded.”—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Craig had applied to hold a minimal parade of six people in Broughshane on July  which would observe social distancing.On Monday Craig Sloan lodged the application for a parade with six participants and two traffic marshals, in the name of Broughshane Drumming Club. “We made it very clear othat it was going to be a socially distanced parade in Broughshane on July ,” he said.“But then on Tuesday the commission phoned and said they weren’t processing any applications and askedI could withdraw it. I was just shocked.”When he protested, he says, he was told that his form was ‘just going to sit there because we are not going to process it’. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In this I believe they have overreached their powers and demonstrated their innate aversion to all things loyalist and unionist.”The commission responded that Stormont’s emergency Coronavirus legislation, passed in March, forbids parades because, although it does not specically mentioned them, they come under restrictions on movement and gatherings. “The enabling announcements for the gradual increase in activity has not yet referred to parades,” it said. The parade organiser had indicated that he was “content to withdraw his notication, pending updates to the regulations and the commission has received no further communication from him,” it said.The Commission encourages organisers to submit applications when the regulations are updated, which will provide a clearer understanding of what public health restrictions may apply, the commission added.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing

One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cddfabbfafbdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbcafbbfefda   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
