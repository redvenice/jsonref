Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.

She now speaks fluent Swahili, because she was determined to converse with her children in their native tongue.Claire’s own mother couldn’t be more proud of how her daughter has chosen to do things — although she has baulked at some of the challenges she has faced.Take the first time Helen, now 63, flew over to visit in 2012 — just a day or so after grandchild number three, Bella, arrived.When Claire was sent from the orphanage to pick up Bella at a neighbouring village, the word was that this abandoned little bundle of skin and bones, weighing just 10lb, was a few months old. In fact, she turned out to be two years old.Helen remembers Claire patiently tending to the little girl’s tiny fingernails and toenails, but not in the usual way.          First there was Alfie, then 13 months old, a little boy she coaxed to smile, and went on to foster and adopt. Alfie is now ten. His siblings, Layla and Isabella, are eight, and little Jack is five‘I remember sitting watching Claire picking maggots virtually out of every pore. It brought home the conditions these children had been brought up in.’There are other colourful memories, such as that time she put bread in the toaster and ‘all the creepy-crawlies came out’. And Nanny — as Helen is known by the children — hasn’t quite recovered from the fact Claire was perfectly happy sharing the kitchen with a lizard.‘It was on the wall,’ she complains. ‘I had a problem with that. But nothing fazes Claire.’Those exotic anecdotes may be numbered, though. Although it was never Claire’s plan to return to the UK with her children, changing circumstances have forced a rethink, and she is trying to get home — new family in tow.Her own mother could not be happier, and the Skype conversations are all about the move. Alfie is desperate to see snow. And they all want to visit Buckingham Palace, and see a red London bus in real life instead of in the books Nanny sends.There is a problem, though. While love is clearly in abundance in this family, money is not. The political climate in Tanzania (meaning Westerners aren’t finding it as easy to get work) means Claire isn’t working — and is finding it difficult to support her family.While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this year.So how can Claire fund the expensive return to the UK? Well, she has turned to that very modern charitable source — crowdfunding, appealing to friends, family and strangers to donate. She needs to raise £34,000 to get herself and the four children back to the UK, the bulk of the money needed for flights and lawyers to assist with the visa applications.          Claire Upshall with the four Tanzanian children she has adopted. They are pictured here in 2017          Although they have no blood ties, the emotional bonds are as strong as they get. ‘They are typical siblings,’ Claire laughs at their spacious, if slightly chaotic, family home just outside Arusha, in north-eastern TanzaniaYet as much as her own family supports her, not everyone does. News reports about her appeal this week were met with a decidedly mixed reaction.While some applauded Claire’s ‘mission’, others have questioned the idea that she should be financially bailed out when the decision to take on the four children was hers alone.One particularly brutal online commentator called her a potential ‘Madonna on benefits’. And what will happen, some asked, if the family still struggle after they arrive in the UK? Will the taxpayer have to foot the bill?‘The whole point is to get them over here so Claire can work,’ Helen says. ‘She has no intention of being on benefits.‘And if I can say one thing about her is that she is a hard worker. She has never been work-shy — quite the opposite, in fact. She came home when her dad was ill, to be with him when he died, and even in those few weeks she got a job here.’Claire herself is appalled at the suggestion she is trying to milk the system. ‘There is no way I want to be on benefits. It’s not who I am. My parents instilled the idea of hard work in me, and I want to do the same with my children. It’s exactly why I want to come home so they can see me work.’It’s a dilemma Madonna and Angelina Jolie and those high-profile advocates of foreign adoption simply do not face. Deep pockets can smooth all manner of problems.          While her parents have always helped her out, they aren’t in a position to do so now. Helen works in the catering industry and lives modestly in a one-bedroom home. Claire’s dad, Derek, from whom Helen was amicably orced, died earlier this yearClaire will have to rely on family to help with childcare while she works and her plight does raise genuine questions about whether the heart should rule the head even in these emotive matters.Should we applaud Claire’s selflessness in putting these children above all else, or question her naivety in thinking she could do it alone?The family’s answer, of course, is that she is not alone. They are clearly close, and have been through a good deal together. The Claire they waved off to Tanzania at 19 certainly hadn’t had a sheltered life.Claire’s elder brother, Adam, was killed in an accident when he was 12, when a rope became tangled round his neck while he was playing. Understandably, Helen and Derek were highly protective of Claire. ‘But you can’t wrap them in cotton wool,’ she argues. ‘And we tried so hard to bring Claire up to be as independent as possible.‘We were worried when she wanted to go to Tanzania, but we knew how she felt about wanting to work with children,’ Helen says. ‘We heard all about Alfie, who seemed special to her. But I had no idea she was talking about my future grandson!’.Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most. An orphan, Alfie, then 13 months old, was perhaps not in as pitiful a state physically as some of the other children (‘we couldn’t save some of the babies who were so malnourished when they came in’) but his behaviour upset her.‘He was very withdrawn and bewildered. Toddlers in the orphanage were always more aware than the little babies, and Alfie just wouldn’t smile. I was drawn to him. You try not to favour one child, but because I was trying so hard to get through to him, it was hard. I got to the stage where I coaxed a smile out of him, and a bond developed. He’d look for me if I left the room.’          Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then JackThat first stint in Tanzania was a short one and Claire returned to the UK to work as a nanny.She felt compelled to go back, however, but when she did she discovered Alfie had been moved to a different orphanage 15km away. She went to visit him. ‘I’m sure he recognised me even at the start,’ she says. ‘But by the end of that visit he was in tears. They had to prise him off me.’Distraught, she wondered if she could somehow sponsor Alfie. But her inquiries led to her asking if she could foster the little boy, and in 2011 she became his sole carer. ‘I still wasn’t thinking adoption,’ she says. ‘At the start, that never occurred to me. And he wasn’t the only one I fostered. I’d often have the sickest babies overnight, or for longer periods. But Alfie stayed.’Five months after Alfie moved in, baby Layla followed. Then came Bella, then Jack. ‘It was a natural progression,’ Claire says.‘It felt right. I’ve always felt that however good an orphanage is, children thrive best in a home situation.’ It was 2016 before the legal process to adopt all four children was completed, but Claire says they felt like ‘hers’ practically from the moment they arrived.Did she ever sit her parents down and tell them about her adoption plans? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But it wasn’t like it was one big decision. It was a series of little ones. And they were always right behind me. They came out and met the children. My dad doted on them. He couldn’t have helped more, and he was really proud of what I was doing.’          \u0027The plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire saysThe plan was never to return to the UK, though. ‘I thought our lives would always be in Tanzania,’ Claire says.Outwardly, they must seem well off compared to the locals. Like many in the expat community, they have a security guard patrolling their home (‘It’s essential,’ says Claire), and a woman who is employed as a cleaner, cook and babysitter. Whenever Claire was working at the orphanage or, latterly, when she has returned to the UK for visits, this lady has looked after the children.But the lifestyle is no longer tenable. The children have been educated at an international school — so they would be fluent in English — and the fees were not affordable some time ago, ‘but luckily when I explained this the school agreed to let the children stay on anyway’.Hence the idea of moving back. Losing her father has just reinforced the idea that Claire needs to be at home.‘It was such a shock,’ she said. ‘Dad was the fittest person I know. He was never ill. But he collapsed one day, and he was dead seven weeks later. I made it home to see him before he died, but it has been devastating. It’s made me realise I want the children to grow up with their extended family. The expat community is a transient one. At home, we will have support.’But the costs involved are eye-watering. And there are other problems, too. It’s by no means a given that the British authorities will extend the sort of warm welcome the family want, and the state of Claire’s bank account will be a major deciding factor.          Claire has cared for more than 200 children since she arrived in Tanzania in 2009, but Alfie touched her heart most‘To satisfy the immigration authorities, you have to have a certain amount in your bank account, around £5,000, and prove that you can support your children, so we are working towards that,’ says Claire.Her online critics will say she clearly can’t support the children, if she is having to crowdfund. Her reply? ‘But longer term, I will be able to. And the big thing is that we have somewhere to live. We are not asking for State assistance.’Claire’s aunt and uncle have offered her and her children a home in the UK. It will be a squeeze, admits Sally Clifford-Smith, 53, who shares her four-bedroom home with her husband and daughter, 22. ‘But we are so looking forward to getting them all home,’ she adds. ‘We aren’t in a position to hand over thousands of pounds, but we can do this.’For Helen, though, the day that she can throw her arms around her grandchildren on British soil can’t come quickly enough.‘I cannot wait,’ she says. ‘I love these children to bits, and we just want them all home.’To help Claire, donate at youcaring.comtheupshall children-836976"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/20/4C1BEFD500000578-0-image-m-70_1526068656020.jpg","title":"A spiky guide royal survival Princess Dianas private secretary","story":"    Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined, writes Jephson\u0027It\u0027s not too late to send me an invite\u0027: Meghan Markle\u0027s...Share this articleMemories of Wallis Simpson, the last American orcee to marry into tsheir ranks, are long, unhappy — and regularly resurface.For the Windsors, therefore, the royal wedding represents a momentous gamble.What, then, must Meghan learn?For the hard reality is that survival as a royal newcomer in a 1,000-year-old family business takes much more than a winning smile and a stylish curtsey.Meghan will be judged by standards that have never been entirely defined and cannot be found in any reference book or on any website.But after eight years as Princess Diana\u0027s equerry and then private secretary, I can offer her the following pointers . . .NEVER ROCK THE ROYAL BOATContrary to what some may think, the essential qualification of a new princess is not an encyclopaedic knowledge of obscure palace protocol, nor the ability to maintain a diplomatically acceptable level of small talk with a halitosis-stricken visiting head of state. Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats.

Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.          Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/10/4C165B2200000578-0-image-m-22_1526030226338.jpg","title":"Cruel kindergarten teacher violently pushes little girl pulling chair her","story":"The mean teacher reaches out and pulls the chair out from under the student as she sits downChilling moment a stranger \u0027attempts to abduct\u0027 a boy by...Incredible story of how a dancer who lost her legs and her...Share this articleThen, as the little girl was sitting down, the impatient teacher suddenly reached over and yanked the chair out from under her in front of all the students.The girl fell hard on her bottom, but was able to stand up quickly. The teacher then threw the plastic chair to the other side of the table. Chinese net users, most of them parents themselves, are shocked by the teacher\u0027s ruthless conduct.           The teacher does not help the little girl as she falls on the floor\u0027This teacher should be sacked!

Prince Albert had projected in 2016 that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimateNow with two children of his own, he told People magazine at the time that he purchased the property that he can\u0027t wait to make new memories there with his own children, twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella.\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to showing the house to the kids, sharing it with them, having them see the garden,\u0027 he said. He projected then that the restoration project would take at least a year to complete, and he was pretty close on his estimate.          Prince Albert and his family worked from top to bottom over the past year-and-a-half to make sure the home properly conveyed the emotional and historical significance it holds for them          On the second floor, four bedrooms including the one where Princess Grace spent her younger years brought back memories for the Prince          Prince Albert gave a tour of the refinished property to the Today Show          Princess Grace Kelly is seen here on January 10, 1956, with her fiance Prince Rainier of Monaco          Prince Rainier III of Monaco and Oscar winner Grace Kelly pose for photographers at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents after the pair\u0027s engagement was announced on January 5, 1956          Prince Rainier of Monaco and film actress Grace Kelly show off the engagement ring to her mother at the home of Kelly\u0027s parents a few days after their announcement          Next to the den, there\u0027s bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern\u0027 Next to the den, there\u0027s a bar which the family referred to as \u0027Kelly Tavern.\u0027 An oar that is believed to have belonged to Princess Grace\u0027s father hangs today above the bar, where the point of his scull is also displayed.In addition to the restorative work, irreplaceable personal touches somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor that survived with etching of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens.          Prince Albert shows Kotb one of the irreplaceable personal touches that somehow remained throughout the residence, like the linen closet floor on the second floor          The linen closet door survived with etchings of the Kelly children\u0027s heights clearly visible, from two years old to their late teens          Though he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure          \u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the familyThough he was thankful the memories were preserved unscathed, Prince Albert couldn\u0027t really offer much of an explanation for the still-standing treasure.\u0027Maybe they thought we were going to take it back one day,\u0027 he said, suggesting previous owners might have realized its importance to the history of the family. That is a sweet thought, but it\u0027s not likely all of the previous owners had such charming intentions in the back of their minds.The property made headlines in 2014 when its 81-year-old former owner pleaded no contest to animal cruelty charges for keeping cats and dogs in unsanitary conditions on the property.Officials with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals seized 15 cats from the home and found the remains of several others.The owner had lived in the large brick house since 1973.

Nor, even, is it a talent for getting out of a low-slung limousine in a low-cut evening gown while maintaining the highest standards of modesty.Least of all is it a gift for attracting huge crowds of adoring new fans (or acres of drooling newsprint).Instead, the one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force.In the whispering labyrinth of the court, unexpected surprises, even nice ones, can be misinterpreted as threats. Anything new or unknown, until it is proven to be harmless, will therefore be treated with suspicion — even hostility. When you\u0027re in the dynasty business, everything is subjected to the ultimate test: will this personthingideadevelopment help or hinder the survival of the current royal line?          The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need was  essentially accurate. Pictured: Princess Diana and Patrick Jephson in Hungary in 1990It\u0027s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.Why? Because the Windsors know that all the grand trappings of royalty are held in trust for the British people and that the monarchy depends for its survival on a very volatile commodity: the benign approval — or, at the very least, tolerance — of its subjects.They also know that everything they hold dear could be lost through miscalculation. After all, in recent family history, their European counterparts have lost their thrones despite reigning for generations with every appearance of indestructibility.The guillotine may never be erected in Trafalgar Square, but a fickle public mood multiplied by merciless digital media has the capacity to decapitate an unpopular royal family — or family member — as surely as any blade.Postponing that day is the unwritten first duty of those in the British royal dynasty business.So, Meghan\u0027s prime function will be to support the Crown, avoid bringing it into disrepute and act as a non-political focus of national unity. Everything else — even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes — is superfluous. The bottom line is that, as a princess, she has no remit to save the world or anything in it. Or preach at us, admonish us or signal any fashionable virtue.Her job is to exist, preferably without rocking the constitutional boat. And if, in the process, by the way she conducts her own life, she gently inspires us to do more and better with our own, then she\u0027ll probably be treated with respect and remembered with affection far into the future.DON\u0027T FORGET ABOUT THE CHAPSNobody could doubt Meghan\u0027s sincerity when she said: \u0027Right now, with so many campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp, there\u0027s no better time to continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people supporting them.\u0027However, the perspective that draws such warm applause at Californian awards ceremonies may need adjusting in a nation with a female prime minister and female head of state.Indeed, Meghan\u0027s advisers may also feel uneasy about an attitude that so readily excludes half the population. She might also like to bear in mind that quite a few members of the Royal Family are men and that not all of them have always managed to achieve #MeToo-approved standards of what is considered to be correct male behaviour.          One key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising forceBEWARE THE REST OF THE FAMILYIt\u0027s been several centuries since any of Harry\u0027s forebears cut off the head of a wife who displeased him. But Meghan should be in no doubt about the House of Windsor\u0027s ability and willingness to exercise some very modern tortures on errant newcomers.Among these must be counted the clumsy efforts of some misguided Charles loyalists to smear Diana not just as sad and mad, but bad as well. As the Diana tragedy confirmed, when dealing with perceived threats, Windsors can be quite uncompromising.If you acquire for yourself a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.This will mobilise the full forces of the Establishment against you.And it won\u0027t feel constrained by any fluffy notions of old-fashioned British fair play.Whatever fairytale image Meghan may have once had of palace life, the reality is as old as time: behind the public image, courts are breeding grounds of intrigue, ambition, gossip and jealousy.DON\u0027T LET IT ALL GO TO YOUR HEADOne evening, I accompanied Diana to a glittering New York ceremony at which she was given the Humanitarian of the Year award. This was an honour she\u0027d tried to resist, partly on the grounds that her job meant she should be giving out awards, not receiving them.Afterwards, over a glass of champagne, I told her: \u0027I think you were right to accept this one. You\u0027ve certainly earned it.\u0027She briefly raised her eyebrows, then turned to look at the night-time Manhattan skyline.\u0027No, Patrick, I don\u0027t deserve this,\u0027 she said. Then she raised her glass. \u0027But I am working on it.\u0027That phrase summed up her vision of herself. And it wasn\u0027t a bad poster image for a very successful brand of royalty: modesty and determination.The danger of Meghan forming a false sense of her own worth is very real.          Everything apart from serving the crown - even developing a globally acclaimed portfolio of irreproachably good causes - is superfluousBE TRUE TO YOURSELFA large part of royal interaction — and especially the bit of it we see in public — is a kind of act. When I was at the palace, we used to joke that nine-tenths of being royal was turning up at the right place at the right time in the right clothes with the right speech in your pocket and the right expression on your face.However, Meghan should beware. Any suspicion that your public persona is not an honest reflection of your real personality will become obvious, sooner or later.It\u0027s also wise to remember that hardly anyone, not even a trained actress, can keep up an act for ever. So Meghan may as well decide that the part of her she allows us to see is one that is both real and reliably predictable. Take Princess Diana. The public\u0027s impression of Diana as a gutsy woman doing her best to help those in need — while raising two sons and fulfilling exaggerated expectations as a royal role model — was, as I saw for myself, essentially accurate.People liked what they saw, believed it to be authentic and wanted more of it.ONE THING YOU SHOULD NEVER DOIn a lifetime of royal service, Meghan cannot expect always to please. She should think long and carefully, however, before reaching for the race card as a response to unfavourable news stories.Her erse ancestry is a positive asset for the House of Windsor, as its members and supporters are well aware. But it would be tragic if Meghan or her husband got into the habit of firing ethnic warning shots at the very same media that will reliably trumpet all their good work for years to come.STEER CLEAR OF POLITICSMeghan should make an early vow to avoid all activity or communication that might be interpreted as a comment on politics or public policy. Her reputation won\u0027t survive theatrical interventions in areas that rightly belong to elected politicians.So her widely advertised support for Democratic politics in the U.S. is a piece of personal baggage that must now be jettisoned. The sacred royal duty of political neutrality doesn\u0027t end at the shores of the kingdom.          Top priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royaltySEEK OUT THE BEST ADVICEThe Royals can choose from a limitless smorgasbord of advice — good, bad and downright dangerous. Ultimately, it\u0027s where Meghan chooses to turn for it that will determine much of her success or failure as a princess.Diana didn\u0027t always choose her advisers wisely. By the time she gave a self-sabotaging interview to the BBC\u0027s Panorama, she had an increasing tendency to seek advice from those who saw her as a useful vehicle for their own agendas.Sadly, they encouraged her to portray herself as a victim, rather than as the strong, influential woman I knew her to be.NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPAINThe Queen has demonstrated over the course of a lifetime that modern monarchy works best when it sticks to the old rule: \u0027Never complain, never explain.\u0027Prince Charles favours a different tactic, drawing criticism for what has been seen as an unwise amount of complaining and an un-royal amount of explaining.Even Harry\u0027s mother was rather too fond of both — although, in Diana\u0027s defence, she may have learned it from her husband.The public doesn\u0027t always respond well to complaints from those who have virtually unlimited resources and plenty of privacy. LEAVE YOUR SHOWBIZ DAYS BEHIND YOUTop priority for a royal apprentice is to know the distinction between celebrity and royalty.Meghan may find that she can\u0027t go to her local shop on Kensington High Street without causing a minor riot. With that kind of profile, it\u0027s all too easy to think your very existence is cause for celebration.For Meghan, who has devoted so much energy to acquiring celebrity, the task of distinguishing between fame she\u0027s earned and fame she has acquired through Harry may be particularly hard. So, if she hasn\u0027t worked it out yet, now is the time to get it clear in her own mind.Get it wrong and she may never be forgiven.Meghan is particularly vulnerable in this respect because there\u0027ll always be sceptics ready to question whether her marriage is a love story or just part of a long-running fame campaign. Although many of the perks of royalty and celebrity are identical, the defining difference is that celebrity lifestyles are won, while royal privileges are granted.They exist in return for a life devoted to service, with lots of visible, unenviable duty and the appearance of sacrifice.Meghan may have already worked out that huge public warmth is directed at Harry and would be shared by anyone he chose to marry.So, even more than most royal newcomers, she\u0027ll be judged by her success as the never-failing source to her husband of strength, comfort, encouragement and wisdom.If Meghan allows doubt to grow that she is anything less than devoted to her man, his family and her obligations to her adopted country, then she may not have the luxury of any second chances.          \u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animalsKEEP OPINIONS TO YOURSELFBeing royal means that you will automatically always be heard, even when you just whisper.It\u0027s a magical power, given to very few and earned by even fewer.Unlike a struggling actress, a princess will be listened to respectfully and in silence, bar a few polite laughs at the right moments.This readily given approval can all too easily give the speaker an inflated and dangerously misleading perception of her own oratory and intellect.The Royal Family usually does best when it follows the example of the Queen.Despite having a powerful platform on which to share her views, insights, big ideas, wishes and prejudices, Her Majesty has resolutely kept her opinions to herself. AVOID CUDDLY ANIMALSCentral to Diana\u0027s success as a humanitarian was her instinct for what made best use of both her status and her compassion.She focused on causes that resonate in the public mind.Her sons have developed their own distinctive and admirable style. But one area where they\u0027ve taken a very different tack is in their promotion of conservation, especially in Africa.\u0027Patrick, we\u0027ll do animal charities when we run out of people charities,\u0027 Diana would say when requests came in for her to be pictured with cuddly animals.The most eloquent speech on the evils of the ivory trade will still do little to boost Meghan\u0027s profile.AND FINALLY...REAP THE REWARDSThe best news for Meghan, for Harry and for an expectant British public is that if she gets it right, the reward will be the secure evolution of the great institution that has welcomed her — and two lives made complete by their service to humanity.  Adapted from The Meghan Factor by Patrick Jephson, published by Bombardier Books, priced £11.22 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e548d403df514a101d2d4cd91e8cce5cfec5678/0_77_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03692b1b6b49dbd020f025f2cbd2034e","title":"the photographer in the garden in pictures","story":"From famous locations to the simplest home vegetable garden, from worlds imagined by artists to vintage family snapshots, The Photographer in the Garden traces the garden’s rich history in photography"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5a1b899464071f73aaf018c75175d04a1687339/22_48_3581_2149/master/3581.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75586c8e52957aafc9bd15adc5178500","title":"may 1968 the revolution retains its magnetic allure","story":"A Stone Roses album, a Hari Kunzru novel, a Gucci ad campaign ... 50 years after the events of May 1968, our writer reflects on how the ideas and energy of that moment live on todayWe are now as far from the events of 1968 as the people involved were from the end of the first world war. Cliche has long since reduced much of what occurred to “student revolt”, but that hardly does these happenings justice, partly because it ignores the workers’ strikes that were just as central to what occurred during ’68 and the years that followed, but also because the phrase gets nowhere near the depth and breadth of what young people were rebelling against, not least in France.This was the last time that a developed western society glimpsed the possibility of revolution focused not just on institutions, but the contestation of everyday reality, which is still enough to make the simple phrase “May 1968” crackle with excitement – even if you were not around when les évenéments took place. I was born in 1969, but what happened in France and beyond retains a magnetic allure.To mark 1968’s 50th anniversary, Christian Dior and Gucci have respectively launched a celebratory collection and ’68-themed ad campaign, proof if any were needed that the year’s legacy has been commodified in a way that plenty of its agitators and thinkers would have seen coming. But there are also more cerebral commemorations: a series of events, focused on liberties and utopias, at Nanterre University, the suburban campus where the French unrest first flared up and at King’s College in London, workshops, film screenings and symposiums on ’68’s protests and what they have come to signify.The leftwing publishers Verso are reissuing a handful of texts, including Tariq Ali’s memoir-cum-history Street Fighting Years and the Raymond Williams-edited May Day Manifesto (1968), arguably the founding text of the British New Left. The same company is also publishing a new book titled Opening the Gates, the compelling story of an attempt at co-operative socialism that took root in the early 1970s at a watch factory in eastern France. Allen Lane, meanwhile, has published The Long ’68, by British historian Richard Vinen, an exhaustive work whose narrative runs across Europe and the US. By a neat historical coincidence, these commemorations happen just as France experiences one of its characteristic spasms of ision and protest. Railway workers are in the midst of three months of rolling strikes, against President Macron’s plans to introduce his country’s transport system to competition and new labour arrangements. At the same time, students are protesting against plans to make university entrance more selective, and proposed changes to the baccalaureate exam system.Thirty years ago, the 20th anniversary of 1968 was the focus of a fortnight-long season on Channel 4, which included a Jean-Luc Godard movie, the three-hour film of 1969’s Woodstock festival and a smattering of documentaries. This was some people’s introduction to a huge historical moment that had rather been forgotten. The members of a Mancunian rock group called the Stone Roses were captivated by footage of one young Parisian, as guitarist John Squire recalled, “chucking stones, with a really nice jacket and desert boots”. They wrote a hymn of cross-generational admiration titled “Bye Bye Badman”, which took its place on an album whose sleeve featured the French tricolour and three slices of lemon – a reference to the fact that the latter had been used in Paris to nullify the effects of tear gas. Meanwhile, others, like me, programmed their VHS recorders for the wee hours and amassed their own ’68 archive.If your mind was ever open to that year’s mixture of subversion and confrontation, it will probably have stuck with you. Most of the time, mundane reality wins out, but from time to time, an explosive critique of modernity bursts through and demands action, even if it just as quickly recedes. This, perhaps, is the essential story of 1968 and its enduring legacy.The book is objective and factual: his sources include police reports and dispatches filed from Paris by British diplomats, but his text still conveys a sense of events so convulsive and all-encompassing that they exude a deeply romantic sense of ordinary reality somehow being suspended. As Vinen recounts, an initial confrontation between students and the authorities at the Nanterre campus – partly over restrictions on male-female living arrangements – spread to the Latin Quarter, and by some process of cause and effect almost impossible to explain, led in turn to a general strike that soon involved 10 million people. “It looked likely that De Gaulle, who had ruled France for 10 years, would fall,” he writes. But this was only the start:“For a couple of weeks, the country seemed to hover on the edge of some kind of revolution – though no one really knew what kind. The leaders of the Communist party, which had been talking about revolution for 50 years, were mystified by, and usually hostile to, the student protest. All sorts of groups were touched by the apocalyptic mood.“There were working-class protests all over the world, but this huge concentration of a general strike in May ’68 was specific to France,” he says. Herein lies an element of the story that the foregrounding of students has sidelined: a restive mood among industrial workers, which he partly puts down to the fact that large swathes of France only began to industrialise after the second world war. “You had a group of workers who’d come into industrial work relatively recently and had never accepted its disciplines and structures, or the disciplines of their trade unions,” he explains. “The other country where that was true was Italy.”The Italian “Hot Autumn” of 1969 was fictionalised in We Want Everything, a 1971 novel by the Italian author Nanni Balestrini, only published in English in 2014. Telling the story of a discontented worker at Fiat’s vast Mirafiori factory in Turin, it captures the mood in Italy during the “Cassa del Mezzogiorno”, the postwar attempt by the Italian government to bring industry to the deprived south of the country.The failure of that effort fed into a revolt against something much more fundamental: work itself, and a regimented, bureaucratic vision of life pushed by both the left and right. Towards the end of the book, there is a speech:The sense of a malaise unanswered by politics defined the spirit of ’68 across the world. As workers and students saw it, communism – whether in central and eastern Europe, or the communist parties in the west – was as much of a blight as capitalism, something vividly illustrated by that year’s so-called Prague spring, and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. More generally, the traditional leftist idea that the state could be the bringer of liberation was dramatically undermined by a widespread conviction that traditional power structures were so problematic as to be almost useless. This latter idea runs through 1968 in the form of a vivid leitmotif: ranks of police – in Paris, London, Chicago – charging at crowds of young protesters.Among the best films about 1968 and its meaning is A Grin Without a Cat, by the French director Chris Marker, and one of its most compelling moments comes during a sequence dedicated to the unrest in Paris. “All of a sudden, the state reveals its repressive side, the one which is more or less diluted in daily life,” says the narrator. “But now, it has to make a show of strength. And to do so, it sends in the police force, with all kinds of gear and contraptions you didn’t know existed. Fine: for the demonstrator, the state appears as a vision, like the Virgin Mary at Fatima. It’s a revelation.”Power, and the eternal human tendency to try to negate it: such has been the story of wildly erse revolts, from the first stirrings of punk rock to the Occupy movement. The latter was criticised for its lack of specific demands, but this missed the point. “What we have in the United States is an oligarchy and what we need is a people’s democracy,” said one protester at Occupy Wall Street. “So we’re occupying this country. We start out at Wall Street, then we spread out and occupy the country and take it back.” Perhaps unwittingly, he was following a famous edict that had been daubed on to a Parisian wall in 1968: “Be reasonable – demand the impossible.”Hari’s Kunzru’s 2007 novel My Revolutions centres on a character, Chris Carver, who is changed forever by the events of 1968. He takes part in sit-ins at the LSE, the famous anti-Vietnam demonstration outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, and then becomes one of the core members of a group who move from direct action to terrorism.There are echoes here of the German Red Army Faction, otherwise known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, but the basis of the story is the Angry Brigade, the London-based group who cut their teeth in the midst of 1968’s tumult. From the summer of 1970 onwards, against a background of rising industrial strife, the Angry Brigade launched a series of bomb attacks whose targets included the embassies of far‑right regimes, the home secretary’s house and the Miss World competition. (In 2002, a journalist from the Observer interviewed the former Angry Brigade member Hilary Creek, who briskly captured the contexts of what she had been involved in: “Basically, I’m not ashamed of anything I have done, going from the student protests at Essex to the organisation for the Vietnam war demonstrations, squatting and the early women’s movement. Some of the things we did I am proud of and we still see the effects now.”)Kunzru is a perfect example of someone who came of age long after ’68, but was dazzled from a distance. “Thatcher got into power when I was nine and the Tories left when I was 27,” he says. “So the idea of living your young life at a time when you believed that everything was about to change and you were on the brink of remaking the world was almost unimaginably distant.” There was also, he felt, a job to be done writing about ’68 and its aftershocks in terms of moral and political complexity, because “there was so little written about what happened back then that wasn’t in the service of mythmaking”.“I was writing in the early years of the war on terror,” he explains. “The question of radicalisation was on everyone’s minds. I wanted to write a book about how you go about deciding to use violence in support of your political beliefs.”The main characters in My Revolutions shape their view of the world into an exacting, almost neurotically judgmental sensibility, which captures how much the thinking of some ’68 activists marked a clean break with the live-and-let-live mores of the hippies. In one passage, Carver and a character called Anna go to a chi-chi party in north London. She says:“Look at these people. Look at them, Chris. They’re blind. They’re happy to ignore everything around them, just pleased to be having a good time. And, as far as I’m concerned, that makes them culpable. It makes them complicit in everything they’re ignoring. Vietnam, the lot. It makes them pigs.”The scene is redolent of another Parisian graffito: “To call in question the society you live in, you must first be capable of calling yourself in question.” Later in the book, Kunzru’s characters act this demand out with the aid of LSD:Anna told Leo she didn’t really think he believed in building the revolution and Leo defended himself and made a counter-accusation and gradually we were all drawn in, putting one another to the question, everyone an inquisitor. Kunzru says this scene drew on the kind of ritualised self-criticism practised by Maoists, and by the American violent protest group the Weather Underground (or “Weathermen”), whose activities decisively began in October 1969 and lasted well into the 1970s. But the scene makes a wider point about one of the plotlines of the years after ’68: the way that revolutionary zeal tends to burn out, and the fact that radical left politics has an tendency to sooner or later turn inwards.Even during ’68 itself, the revolt quickly dissipated, symbolised by De Gaulle’s landslide win in legislative elections, and by the arrival in the White House of Richard Nixon in the following year. So what of ’68’s essential spirit endures? “In the long term,” says Vinen, “it helped create a new kind of left. Partly a less economic left in some ways, a less working-class left. I think in Britain, there are a lot of ways that ’68 fed through into a leftwing Labour party in the 1980s, but also a lot of ways in which the left was rethought, some of which ended up in New Labour. In all countries, there’s a sense that it ties in with a left that involves new kinds of issues: things which may not be very important in ’68 itself, but became important – feminism, gay rights, environmentalism. That’s one part of its legacy.”Another small but vital literary and political legacy centred on two immensely powerful books. Although it was first published in 1967, Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle became the key text that conveyed the profound critique of modernity that motivated some of ’68’s most imaginative rebels. In the age of Facebook, fake news and the sense that our online lives have taken precedence over real existence, it has an amazingly prophetic aspect, evident in its opening sentences: “The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.”Its companion piece is The Revolution of Everyday Life, written by Raoul Vaneigem, a forceful voice in Debord’s organisation the Situationist International. Among this text’s insights is an attack on the supposed importance of work that chimes with a 21st-century conversation sparked by automation: “In an industrial society which confuses work and productivity,” Vaneigem wrote, “the necessity of producing has always been an enemy of the desire to create.”The ideology captured in these books has long been a kind of ghost within western culture and politics, periodically making itself known at moments of crisis and contestation. In late 2011, the writer and activist Paul Mason watched this happen in the wake of student protests at the Conservative party’s London HQ, when what he called a “makeshift anarchism” was afoot, and plans were forming for a new action. “The posters proclaiming this new demonstration … had begun to borrow the imagery of Paris ’68,” he wrote, in Why It’s Kicking off Everywhere. “But since Marx is out of fashion, and Lenin and Mao have been branded left fascists, who else is there to study but the Frenchman whose musings have become required reading in the era of Lady Gaga: Guy Debord?” When people who had come of political age around this time were drawn into a new Labour party by Jeremy Corbyn, their links to the politics of 40 years before quickly became clear. These newcomers have cohered into an imaginative, questioning tendency whose gatherings, which grew out of Momentum and take place alongside the Labour party conference each year, go under the very ’68ish title The World Transformed.Clearly, then, even at 50 years’ distance, the ideas at the heart of 1968’s events live on. “Their brave utopianism and their willingness to think outside the terms they were given – that’s an intellectual legacy we can still draw on,” says Kunzru. “The way the language of capital has robbed us of our dignity as citizens is something we can fight with the intellectual tools they gave us.” His point brings to mind yet another Parisian graffito, arguably even more relevant to our time than it was to the era when it was written: “Are you a consumer or a participant?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d637280414c132b76dbb0fc8a8d0d4547b9633c6/0_646_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab84de5b7e2a9b47ef965c3f64b95ad","title":"britains richest hedge fund manager mike platt sunday times rich list","story":"Tory donor and art collector Mike Platt has boosted his fortune by £600m in a yearMike Platt, a Preston-born financier who started investing at the age of 14 with a £500 gift from his grandmother, has been named Britain’s richest hedge fund manager with a £3bn fortune.Platt, 49, the co-founder and chief executive of Belgravia-based BlueCrest capital management, has increased his wealth by £600m over the past year to retain his crown as the richest hedge fund manager, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Platt, who claims to have never suffered an annual loss, spends a lot of his wealth on art, which he displays in the crypt of a deconsecrated church in Marylebone. The collection includes a black Christ in an electric chair beside skulls, stags’ heads, 5bn-year-old meteorites, a Japanese woman riding a walrus and the levitation of St John the Baptist. There are pieces by the taxidermist Polly Morgan, the Turner prize-winner Keith Tyson and Reece Jones.A Tory party donor, Platt also owns a Bombardier Challenger private jet and homes in London, Switzerland and the US. His first investments, funded by his grandmother, were in Britain’s privatised utilities. The second richest UK hedge fund manager is Robert Miller and his daughter, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, who increased their wealth by £420m to £2bn. Miller, the co-founder of the Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) chain, invests his family fortune via the Hong Kong-based hedge fund Search Investment Group. Sir Michael Hintze, who runs CQS, is ranked third with a £1.4bn fortune. Hintze, who gave £1.5m to the Conservative party in 2014, increased his wealth by £100m. However, the personal wealth of David Harding, another philanthropic hedge fund manager, fell by £300m to £1bn after profits at his fund Winton Capital halved to £107.3m. The top 20 UK hedge fund managers are collectively worth more than £16bn.Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, which is published this weekend, said: “The recent volatility of global stock markets have provided opportunities for the City’s richest hedgies to gild their wealth. “But life as a billionaire hedge fund manager is not a one-way bet. Four big names of the hedge fund world have seen big falls in their wealth over the past year.

A quarter century is long enough for most of us to be civil in those circumstances. But the event planners at Town \u0026amp Country magazine seemingly didn’t have faith that Monica Lewinsky would be capable of acting like a mature adult in that situation. They disinvited her from an event this week after they found out that Bill Clinton was also planning to attend.The party hosts were also not smart enough to remember that it’s a long time since Lewinsky has been silent in the face of insults. On Wednesday, she wrote on Twitter: “Dear world: please don’t invite me to an event (esp one about social change) and – then after i’ve accepted – uninvite me because bill clinton then decided to attendwas invited. it’s 2018. emily post would def not approve.” When it comes to self-preservation, Lewinsky is a model to us all. After some difficult years following her affair with Bill Clinton, she has emerged as a crucial spokeswoman against bullying and shame. That Lewinsky did not perish under the weight of hundreds of thousands of critical, mocking cable news stories and late-night comedy gags is an achievement in itself.Lewinsky is the rare media pariah to not just survive, but to use her notoriety for good. In particular, in the post-#MeToo era, she’s cast a light on how her treatment by the media in the 1990s was a monstrous exercise in misogyny: “The wholesale dissection of a young, unknown woman – me – who, due to legal quarantine, was unable to speak out on her own behalf.” Though Lewinsky takes pains to note that her relationship with the president was consensual, it was also “a giant abuse of power”. And yet, in the context of the Town \u0026amp Country soiree, Lewinsky and not Clinton became the persona non grata. It’s as if a magazine that celebrates the rococo country homes of the rich and famous didn’t get the memo about what people think about sexual misconduct in 2018.“We apologize to Ms Lewinsky and regret the way the situation was handled,” Town \u0026amp Country said the morning after, a classic sorry-but-not-sorry approach: the passive voice, the distancing from responsibility by calling it handled. And what was the situation, in any case? Two people who had a consensual relationship two decades ago were going to be at the same party? That didn’t need “handling”, beyond perhaps a double check of the seating chart. Good manners would assume that two adults in that situation would have the capacity of ignoring each other if they happened to find themselves in the same queue for the bar. Alas, this was just a case of old-fashioned misogyny: of protecting a man from the evidence of his past extramarital misdeeds rather than respecting the humanity, and prompt RSVP, of a woman. That’s just plain rude. But it’s also plain bad party-planning. An articulate and resilient woman makes a better companion than a man who preys on his intern any night of the week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21382daea48faee90773357bb6e8369358978745/53_156_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9149c74e8e779e69466189376a11e09c","title":"why all the sniping at single women are they having too much fun","story":"From Japanese MPs to myriad press reports, unmarried females are either a ‘burden on the state’ or ‘giving up and caving in’, but actually it is society that is intent on ruining their livesAll the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, now put your hands up!

Annoyingly, there is a grain of truth in this, if the single women are childless, as ageing populations put pressure on national health services, including our own NHS.In the past, globally, when people tended to have more children, those children cared for their parents and other older relatives. But in many countries that trend is declining, requiring medical professionals, nurses and retirement homes to bridge the care gap. But it never seems to be the case that politicians pipe up about single, childless men, who also grow old and need care, and who, in their youth, are deified as ambitious or approved of as charming, roguish scamps. It’s women who, in the words of another Japanese politician, are the “birth-giving machines”, and any who choose not to have children, or who can’t, are deemed to be malfunctioning.But hey, single women have become used to this attitude, alongside the millennial generation, who are also responsible for everything bad or depressing. Single women are making everyone feel awkward (particularly the entire global tabloid press if that woman is Jennifer Aniston). Their need for babies is forcing the rest of us to pay for them with our taxes and provide IVF on the NHS (a move that “casts doubt on the government’s family-friendly credentials”, according to the ). Apparently, single women are also responsible for men who go on murdering sprees because they had the indecency to reject them.It’s amazing that single women have the audacity to roam about in daylight, as if they were, in fact, not single and therefore normal. A favourite series of articles of mine on this subject are titled along the lines of: Avoid the Mistakes Single Women Make, which include (really) “being shortsighted about life”, “falling down on the job of life” and “giving up and caving in” .It’s not really a new thing, viewing single women as freaks. Remember that Bridget Jones quote, when she is asked why so many women in their 30s are single? “I don’t know. I suppose it doesn’t help that underneath our clothes, our entire bodies are covered in scales.”Single women deserve a break. Especially because it’s actually society that is ruining everything for single women. There is the extortionate cost of renting alone, or forking out double the cost when you holiday solo, then having to watch couples coo at origami swan napkins while they demand you take photos of them. There is trying to pretend that other people’s babies don’t all look the same. Or, for single women who have children, having to deal with society’s raised eyebrows.A 2017 report found that single women were much happier than single men, mostly because they are not tied down with the emotional and domestic labour that comes with being a woman in a (heterosexual) relationship. It probably also has something to do with the fact that nobody can veto your Netflix choices if you’re the only one making them, and not being dragged along to a partner’s work do. Could these snide asides at single women just be the politics of envy?It’s extraordinary, really, what has happened to Arctic Monkeys. The band made their name thanks to their authenticity, and now a song on their new album, Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino, has Alex Turner playing an ageing rock star and singing “maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s” – despite being born in 1986.Turner has told BBC’s Radio 1 that he feels embarrassed by his old lyrics, even though their second album beautifully summed up a dying relationship as, “Several hours or several weeks  I’d have the cheek to say they’re equally as bleak” while the new record, five years in the making, includes: “I can get you on the list for all the clubs” and has a song called The Ultracheese.It’s not that Arctic Monkeys are bad now – it’s just that they were so much fun then. It was exciting, for those of us who had the bootleg recordings from live gigs, to see their songs transform from the rough to the recorded version (often with name changes – When the Sun Goes Down was first named Scummy).It’s part of the joy of being a music fan watching acts (or their collaborators) evolve and innovate. And though I’m sure repeated listens of TBH\u0026ampC may unearth melodies, somewhere, at the moment it feels like the audio equivalent of an enforced David Lynch marathon and Turner’s piano practice. I mean, Britney went from … Baby One More Time and pronouncing the word baby as “babe-un” and 12 years later gave us Toxic. Kanye’s debut single took a Chaka Khan vocal and made her sound like a chipmunk, but eventually gave us Power. Some acts evolve, others change their DNA. I’m mourning then, for a band that represented all the joy of that first Jägerbomb at a house party and now sound like the drunk old guy in the corner of a pub muttering under his breath.To Carpinteria, a town 85 miles from Los Angeles, which has begun to stink of weed more than a student with low-slung pants and a This Guitar Kills Fascists sticker. Californians voted in 2016 to legalise marijuana, which is great if you love a toke. But it would be awful for people like me who gag on pretty much all of London’s pot-filled streets – Carpinteria’s air essentially sounds like one big plume of dope smoke. Still, the UN found that 44 UK cities and towns are so polluted that they are dangerous to breathe in, dope or no dope. At least in Carpinteria, they’re probably giggling as they choke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ff977ec730ebbfbe902ce09b8e0a6b58765e9c/0_102_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34dd5dd7e285fdf4e332b8d28a355bf9","title":"education leaders oppose tory plans to expand grammar schools","story":"Experts say grammar schools pose a threat to the prospects of disadvantaged childrenOpposition to the latest attempt to revive grammar schools remains undimmed, as the government published details of its plans to pump funds into making more places available at selective schools in England.The government is arguing for expanding school admissions on the basis of exam results for children at 11 - but its latest effort appears unlikely to win converts despite the claim by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, that it will promote social mobility.Kiran Eyre, a governor of a state school with a high proportion of pupils from disadvantaged families, said he was appalled by the government’s plan.“There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that increasing grammar school places improves progressive educational outcomes,” said Eyre, a governor of Coombe Road primary school in Brighton.“Inequality is on the rise and selective education widens the gap further. Schools should reflect wider society people of different faiths, backgrounds and skills working together, with those who come from lower-income families being given a real chance to improve their lives.”The plans announced by Hinds would provide £50m a year to existing grammar schools to expand, either by providing more places or by building new annexes or satellite campuses, potentially in different towns.The opening of new grammar schools is barred by legislation passed under Tony Blair’s government in 1998, but the current government has said satellites of existing schools could be approved.Natalie Perera, the executive director of the Education Policy Institute, said grammar schools posed a threat to the prospects of disadvantaged children.“Our research finds that, as the number of grammar places increases, a penalty emerges for all pupils who live nearby but don’t get in and this penalty is larger for disadvantaged pupils than non-disadvantaged pupils,” Perera said. “Indeed, the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers is wider in wholly selective areas than in non-selective areas.”Hinds said the new funding would be tailored towards existing grammar schools that make an effort to attract and admit children from disadvantaged families and backgrounds.“To be able to expand as a selective school, you will need to come forward with a proposal of how you are going to reach out further with inidual primary schools, look again at your admissions to make sure you are as inclusive as possible, because we want more children from disadvantaged backgrounds to be able to access that education,” Hinds told the BBC.But Melissa Benn, who chairs the Comprehensive Future group, said: “Asking grammar schools to find ways to take in a few more children from poorer backgrounds will not alter the well-established fact that selection harms the educational and life chances of most disadvantaged children.”“The government has broken this promise, dropped the pledge they made to our country’s 6 million Catholics and ignored the tens of thousands of Catholics who campaigned on this issue,” said Malcolm McMahon, the Catholic archbishop of Liverpool, who called the cap unfair. Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, said the decision to allow new voluntary-aided faith schools would be “welcomed warmly by the vast majority of our community”. One group was happy with the consultation’s outcome: universities in England welcomed the removal of plans to force them to sponsor state schools.

So how can we wean ourselves off them?On the eighth-floor isolation ward of London’s University College Hospital, nurses have two lines of defence against the spread of life-threatening diseases. First are the airtight double lobbies in every room. Second – and, arguably, more importantly – are the disinfectant wipes they rely on to prevent the spread of germs and viruses.For nurse consultant Annette Jeanes, the disposable flannels are a godsend that allow her and her staff, not only to protect themselves from superbugs such as C difficile and other viruses, but also to make the most of their time, a crucial factor in the National Health Service.“It’s hard to imagine a time when the NHS didn’t use wipes,” she declares as she surveys the length of T08 ward. “Our nurses are one of our greatest resources and we don’t have enough of them. Wipes have made their lives easier and freed them up to do other things.”Similar arguments could be heard the length and breadth of the UK this week after the government announced plans to address the worst effects of wet wipes following a host of revelations about the ubiquity of the throwaway towels. While the NHS – which is by far the biggest public sector user – can make a strong case for the necessity and benefits of disposable hygiene products, the picture is very different in wider society, where wipes can be more aptly described as a consumer luxury that chokes waterways and threatens wildlife.Until now, the rise of the wet wipe has been irrepressible its history a mirror of global inequality, consumerism and short-term thinking. In the 60 years since the first was deployed, usage has surged to an estimated 450bn a year - or about 14,000 every second.Market research suggests wipes and other throwaway hygiene items are near-perfect markers of haves versus have-nots. In poor nations, usage is close to zero. But once average salaries rise to $1,500 per month, women begin to buy sanitary products. From $3,500, parents are willing to spend on disposable nappies. Once incomes hit $8,000, people splash out on wipes.Age is also a factor. Younger generations whose bottoms were cleaned as babies are more inclined than their parents and grandparents to use wipes. Busy mums are the main market. In the US, 22 million Americans used pre-moist cloths 31 times or more within a week. Between 2005 and 2015, the surface area of non-woven wipes produced in Europe almost doubled.The supplanting of cloth napkins, cleaning rags and toilet paper began 60 years ago.The first pre-moistened, scented napkin was produced in a Manhattan loft in 1958 by a former cosmetics industry employee, Arthur Julius, who later convinced Col Harland Sanders that his finger-lickin’ chicken would sell better if messy eaters could clean up with the Wet-Nap® he had trademarked. Kentucky Fried Chicken has since given away close to a billion wipes. “Enough to reach halfway to the moon,” a spokesman claimed, omitting to mention that disposal will have to be an earthly operation and not a cosmic one.This is only a tiny fraction of the total. Tweaks to the chemical and manufacturing processes have led to alcohol swabs, baby wipes, airline refreshment towels, disinfecting tissues, antibacterials, makeup removers, insect-repellent towelettes and countertop cleaners.Julius’ company – Nice-Pak is still the market leader, churning out 150bn wipes per year – almost 5,000 a second. Rival firms spin out more than that number again, but the most modern products have little in common with the original.Fibres of the paper can now be woven, spun-laced, doused in sanitising isopropyl alcohol, scented, and preserved with anti-fungal agents such as methylisothiazolinone.But the fastest-growing market in recent years is for damp, chemically-treated alternatives to toilet paper, such as adult moist tissues, toddler care products and feminine hygiene wipes. Unlike baby wipes, they are designed to be flushable. Consumers do not appear to know the difference.As well as ugly, it is expensive. Blockages cost the UK about £100m every year, according to Water UK’s director of corporate affairs, Rae Stewart: “Water companies spend billions of pounds every year improving water and sewerage services in this country, but our sewers are just not designed to handle these new wipes which clog up the system. Sewer blockages end up costing the country about £100m every year so it’s clear that something needs to change.”This has contributed to a second wave of pollution of the Thames. Following the contamination of the industrial era, London’s river is now increasingly clogged with the detritus of the consumer age.Walk along the bank near Hammersmith or Barnes at low tide and many of the exposed rocks are flecked with wet wipes discharged through nearby sewer outlets. These are now the most common item of rubbish found on the riverside, overtaking plastic bottles and cotton buds. The citizen clean-up group Thames21 recently claimed wipes are reshaping the waterbed after finding 5,000 in an area half the size of a tennis court.Although some are supposed to be biodegradable, the risks do not go away when they break down. Kirsten Downer, campaigns officer for Thames21 fears for the herons and ducks she sees pecking on the dirty clumps in case they suffer the fate of fish. The problem has also spread along waterways towards the coast. Over the past 10 years, the Great British Beach Clean – an annual event in which volunteers collect rubbish from shorelines – has recorded a fifteenfold increase in the number of wet wipes. On average last year, they found one every five or six steps.The government’s promise of tough action on these single-use plastics has yet to be matched with deeds. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it is not planning a full ban on wet wipes, but says it will work with industry to develop plastic-free alternatives and examine which products are most at fault for sewer problems. Other countries are also taking steps. The European Union is investigating wet wipes as part of a wider study of ocean microplastics. Earlier this month, Australian authorities fined Pental $700,000 for falsely claiming its White King wipes were flushable.Industry leaders in other countries prefer to stress Britain’s exceptional circumstances, saying the problem here is one of sewers rather than products. “I see issues in the UK that we don’t have in the States, notably the presence of waste on the shoreline,” said Dave Rousse, president of the the US Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry. “This suggests – with a high possibility – that sewers are opening out directly into rivers. The waste water is not being filtered.”Rather than a ban, he said the best solution was for better markings on packaging and more education of consumers so they can distinguish between more “flushable” wipes – which are made of cellulosic materials (which break up and sink) – and regular thermoplastic wipes (which bind and float). But many environmentalists and water authority officials are unimpressed by the distinction, and the higher price of the more biodegradable products puts off all but one in 10 buyers.Manufacturers are trying to develop greener products that use wood fibres and other natural materials. There are also calls for a universal ‘Bin it, don’t flush it’ logo on packaging, but the best way to ease the wipe problem is to use them less or stop completely. To help, Thames21 have issued a guide for plastic-free parenting. For the many iniduals and institutions that cannot be weaned, the best bet is to seek the most nature-friendly alternative and to discard items responsibly.At the University College Hospital, which gets through 90,000 packs of wipes each year, staff are trained to dispose carefully. Only used wipes contaminated by faeces, blood and bodily fluids and deemed to be ‘infectious waste’ are destroyed by incineration. All others are ‘macerated’ or pulped down and recycled.Specialist medical suppliers are also working on solutions without plastic. They will inevitably be more expensive, but Jeanes supports change: “I can’t see wipes disappearing from the NHS but it’s a good thing if we are questioning whether we can do things in a way that is better for the environment and reduces our own waste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a310e813be9479ebcb7e830ee78c474f6a98d526/0_123_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36d0d4aa74b34bacb0f4627e659755d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A nesting stork, a rescued bobcat, and flamingos at sunset are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef21e5c47343c1e263d958a08cbc466f5b4490f/203_426_2543_1524/master/2543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12b4ebebe734c5169a8f49a987e5788","title":"rihannas empire empowering women and making lots of money","story":"The singer’s new lingerie brand has been met with fanfare and lengthy online queuesOnline queues and “sold out” signs greeted UK shoppers hoping to purchase items from Rihanna’s lingerie collection, Savage x Fenty, as it launched on the brand’s website on Friday morning. Hype had been building steadily since April, when the singer, whose albums include Anti, confirmed its inception to her 62.5 million Instagram followers.The collection – which became available to purchase at 5am GMT – comprises 90 pieces of lingerie, sleepwear, loungewear and accessories. As with Fenty Beauty – Rihanna’s makeup line, which launched amid fan hysteria in 2017 – the USP of her lingerie offering is the seven “nude” shades designed to match every skin tone.Praise has also been extended to the inclusive sizes on offer. Bras are available from 32A to 44DD (although established brands such as Rigby \u0026amp Peller extend a further five sizes, to a J cup), while underwear and the rest of the collection ranges from XS to 3XL. To further assert the body-positive message, the pieces are modelled by a erse group of models of all sizes and skin tones, including plus-sized Instagram star Audrey Ritchie.“Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” Rihanna told US Vogue. “I can only hope to encourage confidence and strength by showing lingerie in another light. You don’t have to stick to one personality with lingerie it’s fun to play around ... I want people to wear Savage x Fenty and think: I’m a bad bitch. I want women to own their beauty.”Savage x Fenty prices start at about £13 for underwear, rising to £89 for a corset. Shipping is available to 210 countries. By 8am, several of the pieces from the promotional campaign – including the microfibre T-shirt bra (£30.50) and the lace teddy (£61.79) – were already gone. In September 2017, when Fenty Beauty launched exclusively at Harvey Nichols in London, queues formed around the block as fans stood in line for up to three hours, while 8,500 online customers queued to shop before 8am on launch day.“While we predicted that the brand would be popular with our customers and Rihanna fans alike, we could not have predicted how quickly the products would sell out,” says Jo Osborne, concessions and beauty buying director for the department store. “Rihanna certainly has the midas touch and is a smart businesswoman amassing quite an empire.”The immediate success of Savage x Fenty is testament to Rihanna’s pulling power and business acumen. The 30-year-old, who was discovered in Barbados aged 16, has eight multiplatinum studio albums under her belt and was ranked 7th in Forbes’s list of the highest-paid women in music in 2017, with earnings of $36m (£27m) in the previous year. Her 2016 collaboration with Puma generated $1bn in sales for the sportswear brand, while Fenty Beauty, on which she partnered with LVMH-owned brand incubator Kendo, was named one of the best inventions of 2017 by Time magazine. She is a philanthropist, too: in 2012, she established the Clara Lionel Foundation, a US non-profit organisation that benefits impoverished communities across the world, for which she was named humanitarian of the year by the Harvard Foundation in 2017. She puts her success down to intuition. “I approach everything with the same mentality,” she says. “It has to be authentic, it has to be from me, my perspective. I’ve wanted to do a lingerie line for a long time, but it was important to me that it be done right. To push past the boundaries associated with lingerie and encourage women to embrace their uniqueness. Everyone should feel good wearing lingerie.”Savage x Fenty has a membership programme that costs $50 a year and gives early access to launches, limited-edition pieces and free shipping.“Membership brands are so hot right now and Rihanna can certainly create something special where people feel like they belong and want to buy from her,” Georg Richter, CEO and founder of the subscription commerce platform OceanX, told the fashion trade newspaper Women’s Wear Daily. “A person like her has it easy in this business, because people are already looking for her – she’s a modern influencer. It’s hard to start something if you don’t have that reach.”The extent of Rihanna’s influence was apparent in March, when she wiped almost $1bn off the value of Snapchat’s parent company, Snap Inc, after criticising the social media app for hosting an advert that appeared to make light of domestic violence.This year she is broadening her horizons again to star in the all-female lineup of Ocean’s 8, alongside Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Anne Hathaway.The film draws a parallel with the female empowerment message behind her lingerie line. As she says of Savage x Fenty: “As women, we’re looked at as the needy ones, the naggy ones, the ones who are going to be heartbroken in a relationship. Savage is just the reverse. And you know, guys don’t like getting the cards flipped on them – ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a53ed7428ec8ceb8d134a0662b823bb70ee67fe/0_277_3944_2367/master/3944.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f3ac71f81411ce68ddff823767d00d","title":"the image book review jean luc godard cannes 2018","story":"The veteran auteur returns to Cannes with his latest essay film, a mosaic of clips and fragments lent the urgency and terror of a horror movieImage Book is a work that reprises many of Jean-Luc Godard’s familiar ideas, but with an unexpected urgency and visceral strangeness. It’s an essay film with the body-language of a horror movie, avowedly taking Godard’s traditional concerns with the ethical status of cinema and history and looking to the Arab world and indirectly examining our orientalism – Godard cites the Conradian phrase for a culture held “under Western eyes”.Appropriately there are some amazingly fierce images, and the screen of Cannes’s Grand Theatre Lumiere is a colossal canvas over which to spread them.As so often in the past, Godard churns the dark waters of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Image fragments are dislodged from the deep, and come floating up to the surface: paintings, news headlines, classic Hollywood clips, often digitally distorted or bleached out or suffused with a snow-blind white glow. These are juxtaposed with brutal news footage and Isis YouTube propaganda. Here are the alienations and macroaggressions of the contemporary world.Image Book is the signature Godard irony-mosaic of clips and fragments, with sloganised, gnomic texts, puns in brackets, sudden fades-to-black, unpredictable, unsynchronised sound cues which appear to have been edited quite without the usual concern for aural seamlesness, and vast, declamatory orchestral chords.Godard’s is a cinematic language that has now possibly been largely co-opted by the cultural theorist or the conceptual artist. But Godard always insists on the larger, traditional prerogative of film and the grandeur that only cinema, only the phenomenon of people gathered in the dark before the vast screen, can convey.In Image Book he appears to gesture, again, at the subject of cinema’s culpable failure to witness the horrors of the modern world, failure to account for Auschwitz and Hiroshima. Cinema, that thrillingly seductive and ersionary mass-image-industry of the twentieth century, evolved in tandem with technologies that gave us wholesale slaughter, genocide and tyranny - outrages which happened behind cinema’s back. This is, I think, still at the heart of Godard’s view and at the heart of the title here. What is the status of the image? Is it text? If it is a sign then what is its real-world referent? Just another sign? Another book? Can we empathise with the sufferings of others, the sufferings of oppressed peoples, if the news of such suffering is just an ideologically constructed text of images and words?But now perhaps, the problem is different. There are too many images. Still images. Moving images. Images on our phones and iPads. We are drowning in images – they swamp our ability to make sense of them. Godard selects, with his cinephile connoisseurship and his old leftist anger - and we are bombarded with eyeball-frazzling pictures plucked out of context. The supersaturated colours of video are a thrillingly dissonant, deafening synesthesia. It is bewildering. I’m not sure I understood more than a fraction and of course it can be dismissed as obscurantism and mannerism. But I found Image Book rich, disturbing and strange.

The outgoing manager has promised to reveal all one day but now, on the eve of his final game at Huddersfield Town on Sunday, it is not the time. There is life in the tease yet. But did he regret having always stayed put? “Maybe,” Wenger replied, which felt faintly shocking.The 68-year-old is resolutely not one for regret or looking further back than the previous match. He has taught himself to blot out personal feeling, to compartmentalise, to “control the animal that is inside of you”. But when he held his final briefing as the Arsenal manager with the written press, he was reflective and wistful.Wenger admitted that, like most observers, he separated his lengthy tenure into two parts – the Highbury years and the Emirates Stadium era. The club’s 60,000-seat bowl, into which they moved in 2006, is a monument to Wenger and he was not about to speak ill of it. And yet, when he talked so lovingly about Highbury – the scene of his greatest triumphs – it was possible to sense internal conflict.“Highbury had a special spirit,” Wenger said. “It’s a cathedral, a church. You could smell the soul of every guy that played there. The Emirates was like buying a new house. It took us a while to feel at home there. It’s a fantastic stadium but there was something special at Highbury that you could never recreate when you build something new.”Wenger painted a picture of the Emirates move as a necessary but painful aspect of the club’s evolution in the context of Premier League expansionism something they were somehow pressed into by the circumstances of the time. “We had to do it,” he said. “There is no club that can turn down people who wanted to attend the game.”But it is plain that Wenger feels it restricted him. The idea was that the increased revenues from having more match-going fans would propel Arsenal to a position of financial pre-eminence. The problem was that broadcast money, rather than that from the turnstiles, would become the principal driver over the decade or so that followed. The other major issue was the emergence of extremely rich owners at rival clubs.Wenger dwelt on Dein. He had mentioned him apropos of nothing last Tuesday, paying tribute to the man who appointed him, and the bond between the pair runs deep. Dein left Arsenal in April 2007 and he would eventually be replaced by Ivan Gazidis in January 2009. “Ideally, I would have loved to continue working with him,” the Frenchman said of Dein.Wenger believes that Tottenham will be forced to confront similarly harsh realities in the short-to-medium term as they live their own stadium rebuild. Arsenal’s neighbours must find at least half a billion pounds to finance the project.“The prices for the stadium have doubled but the transfers of players have tripled or quadrupled,” Wenger said. “Today, a guy like Harry Kane – I don’t know for much they can sell him: £100m? So they might have more supply. But they have to face it. Will Tottenham have to sell players? To Arsenal, maybe.”Wenger gave a mischievous smile. There is no doubt that since what has come to be known as The Announcement, he has loosened up a little. He also admitted, at last, why he insisted on dragging the media to St Albans for 8.45am press conferences – and it was what we had always suspected. (It is possible to count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he was on time.)“I know that in the press, nobody likes to get up early so it is to make you suffer a bit, as well,” he said.Yet it was his own suffering that undercut the final address. This is a man who has lived in north London for 22 years but, by his own admission, does not know the way into town. “Basically, I’ve never been to the centre without a driver,” he said. “My way was Totteridge-London Colney.” In short, Wenger’s life has been Arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001709f56c49b915d0d1cd4ea98eb840d22c4819/0_120_2926_1756/master/2926.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aea4b76b8a9b60936a791a1268e1b6e0","title":"derby county fulham championship play off match report","story":"The side who finished sixth in the Championship have not won promotion through the play-offs since Blackpool managed it in 2010. Derby County have spent the intervening years seemingly finding new and more elaborate ways not to go up but they took a step towards the top flight with a battling 1-0 win over Fulham in the first leg of their semi-final on Friday night.This was a granite solid performance from Derby, defending Cameron Jerome’s first-half header as if the very future of the club depended on it, and keeping Ryan Sessegnon and Aleksandar Mitrovic, who have laid waste to the Championship at times this season, quiet all night.Fulham’s manager, Slavisa Jokanovic, did not seem overly concerned, though. “It’s not a bad result,” he said afterwards. “Definitely not the result we deserved. This is a very good performance from my point of view.”The game started in that usual frantic, uncoordinated mess that these play-offs tend to. Both teams tried to start on the front foot, which is a sure recipe for entertaining chaos. Fulham tried surgically to pick holes in the Derby backline but without any real joy. A couple of fairly weak efforts was the best they could manage. The Rams showed little of the same intricacy, yet their more simple approach was brilliantly rewarded in the 34th minute.Tom Huddlestone spread the ball to Craig Forsyth who, pinged over a superb cross from deep on the left, right on to the head of Jerome, who powered his effort into the net. Before the run-in Jerome had scored only once since joining Derby in January: that was his fifth in the last four games. When he signed it seemed like a curious move: now it looks inspired.The Fulham of the first half looked more like the side of the past few weeks, when they have seemed tired and tense. It is tempting to think that extraordinary run, 23 games unbeaten that nearly won them automatic promotion, had come a tiny bit too early and had sapped their energy. One could tell the travelling fans were getting nervous: at the start of the second half they started booing a ballboy.After the break their team showed more purpose: Kevin McDonald belted a shot against the bar, Floyd Ayite volleyed over from a terrific long pass by Matt Targett and Tom Cairney curled a shot just wide. Yet they struggled to create a significant chances of note.Mitrovic, so often Fulham’s brutal inspiration in the latter months of the season, struggled to find space to do much damage and began dropping deeper and deeper as he searched for the ball. Plenty of credit must go to Curtis Davies, who marshalled the big Serb superbly. “Defensively all game, we handled them really, really well,” said Rowett.Sessegnon, the boy wonder of the Championship, was also kept quiet. He was taken off with 15 minutes to go, his anonymous performance suggesting two things: that Andre Wisdom had done a fine job in neutralising him, and also that a rumoured call-up to the senior England squad is too soon for a player who does not turn 18 until next week.On the touchline, as Fulham attack after Fulham attack was snuffed out, Jokanovic, in that brooding manner of his, cast his eyes towards the ground like a parent who was not angry, just disappointed. If this often thrilling side do not go up this season, it will be a shame but in truth they deserved no more from a game where they did not make enough of their theoretical domination. They will need to be more clinical in the return on Monday.The result leaves the second leg placed beautifully. “We can’t go down there and try to protect the lead. We’ve got to try to win the game,” Rowett said, expressing the requisite degree of caution. “It gives us a slender lead but, as we know, that can be cancelled out in a second. I didn’t let them have the music on in the dressing room because we’ve got to be focused for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c12cb65ea8ca3c5b56cf69050f317709a190e7d/0_80_2470_1483/master/2470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8bea1635bdf1a7c590f799bc204c6de","title":"derby v fulham championship play off semi final first leg live","story":"Cameron Jerome’s first-half header gives Derby a narow first-leg lead ahead of Monday’s return leg at Fulham. Ok, that rounds us off for the first leg of the first Championship play-off. More to come tomorrow, when Middlesbrough take on Aston Villa at tea-time. Here’s Nick Miller’s report from Pride ParkI’m very happy with lots of things. We were a counterattacking threat all night which we worked on. Defensively, we were very well disciplined. Curtis Davies marshalled them very well. I was disappointed we didn’t pick them off for a second. The goal was the first time we showed a bit of composure. The goal comes from a bit of good play. We have given ourselves a fantastic opportunity. There goes the final whistle. Derby, resolute and threatening. Fulham were disappointing and fragile.90 mins: Fulham are careless in the dying seconds, and give the ball away. Anya, though, cannot do much with it. There were no teammates ready to receive a cross. 90 mins: Applause as Carson takes an age over a goal-kick. Derby fans trying to sing the nerves away. And their team is now dallying over throw-ins down the right-hand flank. 90 mins: Plenty of pictures of fans biting nails, sucking thumbs and rocking on their heels. Agony for the home fans, and even worse for Fulham supporters, perhaps.90 mins: There will be four added minutes, which seems maybe a minutes in excess, and the Derby fans are none too amused. 89 mins: Derby sub: On comes Jamie Hanson for a limping Weimann. 88 mins: Fulham step it up again. A dinked cross to Mitrovic, but the striker can’t keep his header down.87 mins:  Sub: Oliver Norwood is on for Fulham, replacing Johansen.87 mins: Cairney chance. In typical style, he ghosts into space, and his shot spinnakers towards goal. Carson was beaten, but so was the post. 86 mins: And Bradley Johnson booked too, for Derby, for a tactical foul as Fulham looked to be breaking.85 mins: Johansen booked for Fulham.84 mins: Weimann on the break, falls over at exactly the wrong moment. Derby were close to being through and Weimann, who slipped on the ball, looks to have hurt himself. 82 mins: Kebano is getting involved, and been more prominent than Sessegnon, but still, Fulham, who have scored in every game in 2018, look incapable of carving out chances. Mitrovic forces a corner.81 mins: Derby fans are giving it the big one. “Super Derby, super Rams” and their team has been pretty heroic so far, though the lack of a second goal will only add anxiety. 79 mins: Not sure those subs have had the desired effect for Fulham. Suddenly, their attack looks even more lacking in cohesion. For Derby, Anya and Nugent have been effective in releasing the pressure.77 mins: Fulham pile it on, but Derby have reclaimed something of their early poise in defence and throw a wet blanket over the danger. 76 mins: First booking: Weimann for clattering Kebano and then protesting too much. 75 mins: Better signs for Derby, even better signs when Sessegnon and Ayite leave the field for Piazon and Kebano. Sessegnon, the EFL Player of the Year no less, was negligible. 74 mins: Odoi has to take evasive action. Lawrence again gets space, and Nugent was lurking with intent. Another Derby corner comes to nothing when a whistle is blown for an infringement. 72 mins: Tom Lawrence gets to the byline, and his ball arrows into the six-yard box. Anya cannot reach it. Would a centre-forward like Vydra or Jerome have done better? 71 mins: Tom Huddlestone opens up Fulham with a long pass. Anya forces a corner. It went to the back post but Bradley Johnson was penalised for some shoving.69 mins: Targett overlaps and nods down for Mitrovic, but he overbalances and the ball ends up squirting behind the goalline. The ball not quite dropping for Fulham.68 mins: Derby subs: off come Jerome and Vydra, while on come David Nugent and Ikechi Anya. 66 mins: Fulham ratcheting it up. Derby going last-ditch. But pressure is relieved when Mitrovic can’t keep the ball in.64 mins: Mitrovic attempted to slalom through but Davies denied him again. It is, though, getting ragged for Derby. 63 mins: Cairney at last surges forward from midfield. A fierce shot but straight at Carson. 62 mins: Long, hopeful ball from Vydra, and Bettinelli came out to the edge of the centre circle to deny Jerome. He had to since Odoi was dithering, but this was as foolhardy as it was brave.60 mins: At such a point, do players begin to think of their clubs’ poor record in the play-offs? Possibly not the best course of action for these specialists in play-off failure. 59 mins:  This is opening up now. Mitrovic denied that time but becoming ever more prevalent. 57 mins: Fulham are known for late goals, and it looks as if half-time has leadened Derby’s legs. That said, Lawrence found space, but the ball up to him from Weimann had been any use, that could have been 2-0. Neither team have shown the attacking precision they will find in the Premier League. 55 mins: Now a chance for Weimann at the other end. Looped ball over and the Austrian gets a shooting chance. Fredericks, though, was in the right position to put him off. The angle was also far too acute. 54 mins: Another great Fulham chance! Long, diagonal ball from Johansen finds Ayite clear on goal but he can’ keep his shot down.53 mins: Fulham rattle the bar! Mitrovic holds the ball up and McDonald smashes it. Carson was beaten.

What are your views?Supporters’ voices are essential to our monthly podcast, We Need to Talk About…, whether our subject matter is Brexit, nationalism or the environment. In our next podcast, we’ll consider the rise of veganism as a lifestyle choice – why are so many are opting to go vegan, and what are the implications for society?Since  columnist Decca Aitkenhead wrote about her own vegan experiment, and we published a long read on the topic, we have had a huge number of responses – from readers, academics, experts and others. Defying naysayers’ predictions that it was yet another hipster food fad, adopting a plant-based lifestyle is becoming a popular choice for people for many different reasons. We’ve invited Decca into the studio to host our next podcast and we’d love you, the ’s supporters, to pose questions to her for the discussion. Have you or a family member recently adopted a vegan lifestyle? Have you been driven by ethical, health, environmental or financial factors? If the factors are environmental, are you concerned mostly with deforestation, bioersity loss, or something that affects you more locally? If you made the choice for health reasons, have you noticed the benefits and have you found it easy to eat a balanced diet? Is it a decision you made alone or as a family? Is it something you tried but later decided against? Perhaps you are a lifelong vegan and you are relieved to see it becoming more mainstream?Another point for discussion could focus around the role of social media in the rise of veganism. There are a number of Netflix documentaries on the subject there are Instagram influencers and prominent academics who are becoming vegan. Perhaps it works for them, but is it for everyone? There have also been concerns that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. You might want to discuss the potential issues around this surge in public curiosity. Or explore how your consumption and habits have changed in recent years. Are you sceptical about the rise of veganism, or inspired by it? How can farmers and food producers adapt to better cater to the change in demand? Please do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences.

Listeners to The Start have heard Ai Weiwei open up about being targeted by the Chinese authorities after his artwork commemorating the 80,000 people killed in the hushed-up Sichuan earthquake about Sofia Coppola’s nerves when her father Francis appeared on the set of her first film, The Virgin Suicides and Peaches ulge how cancer and the painful end of a relationship inspired her to make her debut album, the electronic music landmark The Teaches of Peaches.Eva Krysiak, The Start’s producer, says that artists jumped at the chance to talk about their first major creative acts. “I must have sent 400 emails asking people to take part and almost everyone we got in touch with was interested,” she says. “It’s a really warming and personal subject that is easy to talk about: there’s nothing threatening about it, there’s no prying.” Furthermore, talking about their formative work “allows people to delve into their past and remember what it was like to be an everyday Joe – a little glimpse of life before the flashbulbs were popping”.That’s not to say that there haven’t been some revelations – not least that Damien Hirst’s artistic awakening came after he broke into the house of his neighbour, a compulsive hoarder. “With a subject matter like this you can ask slightly more personal questions,” Krysiak says. “You can say ‘the time you were making this piece was the start of a relationship with somebody that you mentioned meant a lot to you – can you tell me a little bit more about that relationship?’ You hope that somebody felt comfortable enough to give you something a little bit precious or close to their heart.”The intimacy of the podcast format also encourages interviewees to open up. “There’s no camera – it feels like a safe space,” Krysiak says. “People say that being interviewed for radio feels like therapy. You are in this cosy room together, and often the sound is very soft, there’s a sense that nobody is going to interrupt you, so you have to use all of those things to your advantage.” She adds that Hirst regarded the opportunity to be interviewed about his artistic genesis as an opportunity to reveal a different side to the brash Brit-artist. “Listeners said the episode changed their perceptions of him, and that he was really likeable. They went away feeling completely different about his work. That was really nice, to realise that it takes the right kind of media and the right kind of question for that to happen, and I think that’s what podcasting is really brilliant for.” The Start was an immediate hit, with over 140,000 listeners, and people emailing in from around the world “saying that we’d made something unique and touching”. Its innovative sound design also made The Start stand out. “There’s a lot of texture,” says Krysiak. “We build up a sense of time and place using sound effects and archives, really bringing the spoken word to life. There’s a lot of layering in terms of sounds, a lot of warping and sometimes adding effects to pull people out of reality and pull them into that world of imagination and then straight back into what the speaker’s saying.” The Start was the result of a long debate at the  about what a new arts-based podcast should be. Krysiak says that she wanted it to mix household names like Hirst, Coppola and Ai with artists who are less familiar, like internet artist Ann Hirsch and drummer and composer Mark Guiliana, who played on David Bowie’s final album, Blackstar. She also ensured that there was a 5050 gender split, a multi-disciplinary approach and a distinctively international outlook, including Iranian video artist Shirin Neshat as well as Brits Abi Morgan and Lemn Sissay.A second series is being commissioned, to go live towards the end of this year, and with a new group of new names on Krysiak’s wish list. She would love to interview Marjane Satrapi, the IranianFrench author of Persepolis, “for the fact that she represented a totally different kind of ‘art’, namely the graphic novel, which also combines two different art forms, drawing and storytelling”. Toni Morrison is high on the list, to allow the author to translate her vivid storytelling abilities to the medium of audio, and to present “the firsthand realities of trying to succeed in a time and place that presented so many challenges for a black female writer.” David Lynch, the director of Twin Peaks, is another aspiration: “for managing to make it big with what must have initially been seen as a completely leftfield creative mindset and potentially impenetrable ideas”. Lynch on getting something as flat-out bizarre as Eraserhead out into the world: who wouldn’t love to listen to that?You can review and subscribe to  podcasts on , iTunes, Soundcloud, Audioboom and Mixcloud.

She urged customers to ditch Npower: “Consumers should vote with their feet. Switching suppliers will always help consumers get the best deal.”Gillian Guy, the chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “At a time when many energy customers are struggling with their bills, this price rise will be hard to stomach for the approximately 1 million customers affected.”Comparison site Energyhelpline argued that “no one should pay such high prices for their energy”.It added that households could save hundreds of pounds by switching to smaller suppliers, pointing out that the 10 cheapest deals on the market ranged from £796 to £829, compared to Npower’s £1,230.Stephen Murray, energy expert at switching site MoneySuperMarket, said: “This is a chunky rise from Npower – all we need now is something from SSE and it’s a full house from the big six.”Npower is merging with SSE’s energy supply unit, but the deal is facing a full-scale investigation by the competition watchdog, which said that the merger could increase household energy bills. SSE is the only one of the big six energy firms not to have announced a price increase. Four of the others have increased their standard tariff, while E.ON increased bills by as much as £50 by removing discounts. One small supplier said this week that it expects wholesale prices to continue rising this summer, raising the spectre of more rises before the government price cap takes effect next winter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993efc7f18e978cd9b43dee3d7ffffe84951f6b5/554_59_4224_2535/master/4224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e0d3d41c0182a9bff1c154045048ca","title":"how metoo revealed the central rift within feminism social individualist","story":"It’s not a generational ide, but rather a split between two competing visions of feminism – social and inidualist. By  Moira DoneganWhen the #MeToo moment began in earnest last October, many women felt optimistic, galvanised others felt uncomfortable. As stories of abuse and harassment accumulated in the media, men began to experience consequences for their treatment of women. Some lost jobs, others were demoted, many faced public embarrassment. The careers of men such as Hollywood producer and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, masturbating comedian Louis CK, and predatory actor Kevin Spacey were declared dead. Others, like the groping chef Mario Batali, took a temporary “step back” from their public lives. A reckoning seemed to be underway, and many women felt that it was long overdue.In the media and in private life, conversations about consent, hostile environments and power began, and there was a growing acknowledgment that a man’s unwanted sexual overtures were a symptom of broader social and political forces. Soon, these discussions were interrupted by hand-wringing and anger from male commentators – everyone from conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan to Donald Trump – who claimed the movement had gone too far before it really began. But unexpected ides emerged between feminists as well.Some feminists urged caution others wanted the reckoning to go further. But the most common complaint about #MeToo came from those who felt that the whole movement had very quickly become silly. Self-described feminists such as Daphne Merkin and Bari Weiss in the New York Times, Katie Roiphe in Harper’s, Germaine Greer in the Sydney Morning Herald and 100 French women in Le Monde complained that many of the incidents of harassment were too minor to warrant opprobrium. They argued that by grouping together such a wide spectrum of sexual misbehaviour, #MeToo had lost a sense of nuance. They called on women to toughen up. Whatever happened to no-nonsense rejections, they asked. Those who complained about harassment and assault, Merkin wrote, “perceive themselves to be as frail as Victorian housewives”. By this logic, women could solve the problem of sexual harassment and assault with good humour, patience and a high tolerance for pain.This disagreement was quickly characterised in the media as generational. Older feminists, we were told – say, anyone over 40 – were sinisterly complicit, laughably outdated, or just too scared of overstepping. Younger women, depending on who you asked, were either righteously passionate, naively idealistic, or out for blood.In part, this notion of a generational ide came from the feminist opponents and supporters of #MeToo themselves. In Harper’s, Roiphe derided the #MeToo movement as “Twitter feminism”, giving the impression that only narcissistic, social media-obsessed millennials want a reckoning over sexual assault. In her article criticising the direction #MeToo was taking, Bari Weiss emphasised the youth and naivety of an anonymous woman who made allegations against the comedian Aziz Ansari. Meanwhile, the feminist website Jezebel, whose readers and writers skew young, ran an article headlined “The Backlash to #MeToo is Second-Wave Feminism”, gesturing vaguely at a misguided crop of older feminist thinkers but not engaging much with those thinkers’ actual achievements and failures. Each side used age stereotypes, with varying degrees of cynicism – older women were crotchety or out of touch, younger women were egoists or spoiled children. None of this commentary seemed interested in the fact that the women coming forward with stories of sexual abuse were both young and old. #MeToo’s feminist detractors also come from different generations. At only 32, Weiss is young enough to be Merkin’s daughter, or Greer’s granddaughter.The #MeToo moment and its backlash made it clear that there really was a ide among feminists, but analysis of that ide cast it as a mere catfight, or a screaming match between weary mothers and teenage daughters. The implication was that the feminist debate unfolding around #MeToo is a kind of routine domestic drama, something we’ve seen before.This is a mistake. A closer look at the arguments being made by these two camps reveals a deeper, more serious intellectual rift. What’s really at play is that feminism has come to contain two distinct understandings of sexism, and two wildly different, often incompatible ideas of how that problem should be solved. One approach is inidualist, hard-headed, grounded in ideals of pragmatism, realism and self-sufficiency. The other is expansive, communal, idealistic and premised on the ideals of mutual interest and solidarity. The clash between these two kinds of feminism has been starkly exposed by #MeToo, but the crisis is the result of shifts in feminist thought that have been decades in the making.The central claim of the anti-#MeToo feminists is that the movement does not treat inidual women as moral agents with the capacity to say no, to enjoy and pursue sex, and to do wrong. From this perspective, women who come forward about their experiences of harassment or assault should often be given more responsibility for those experiences than the rhetoric of #MeToo assigns them. This thinking partakes in a long moral tradition – one that’s highly compatible with capitalism – in which personal responsibility, independence, and willingness to withstand hardship are revered as particularly valuable virtues. It’s an ethos of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – from poverty into prosperity, or, in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ logic, from “feminine” victimhood into “masculine” strength. They believe that the pervasiveness of sexual harassment suggests that it is inevitable, and that the best response is not anger, but resolve. Theirs is a feminism that posits that inidual women have the power to make choices to diminish the negative impact of sexism, and to endure any sexist unpleasantness that can’t be avoided – if only they have the grit to handle it.On the other hand, there is the #MeToo movement. It might seem strange to assert that #MeToo can be spoken of as a single ideology at all – that this cultural moment, which has exposed such a broad array of bad behaviour across so many industries and disciplines, could ever be coherent enough to have an agenda. But #MeToo, as a social movement and as a personal gesture, makes certain assumptions that aren’t compatible with the intellectual habits of most mainstream feminisms that have preceded it. By saying “me too”, an inidual woman makes herself a part of a broader group, and chooses to stand with others who have been harassed, assaulted or raped. This solidarity is powerful. It is still rare to see such a large group of women identifying their suffering as women’s suffering, claiming that they have all been harmed by the same forces of sexism, and together demanding that those forces be defeated.In this light, the ersity and breadth of the #MeToo movement is not a weakness, but a strength. After all, if so many women, with so many different kinds of lives, have experienced the same sexist behaviour from men, then it becomes easier to believe that the problem goes beyond iniduals and instead relates to wider cultural forces. The ubiquity of sexual harassment means that an inidual can’t simply avoid it by making the right choices, or by steeling herself with forceful determination the demand that she do so begins to look absurd.Call it, then, a conflict between “inidualist” and “social” feminisms. In part, the rift is between visions of how to undertake the feminist project, of which tactics are best: whether through inidual empowerment, or through collective liberation. But there is a greater moral ide between these two strands of thought, because #MeToo and its critics also disagree over where to locate responsibility for sexual abuse: whether it is a woman’s responsibility to navigate, withstand and overcome the misogyny that she encounters, or whether it is the shared responsibility of all of us to eliminate sexism, so that she never encounters it in the first place.This tension, between inidualist and social feminisms, has dogged the women’s movement since its revival in the mid-20th century. According to the inidualist model of feminism, personal responsibility, inidual freedoms and psychological adjustments offer a woman meaningful routes out of the suffering imposed by patriarchy, and into equality with men. Many of the most famous western feminists have been working in this tradition. For instance, Betty Friedan, author of the hugely influential 1960s feminist text The Feminine Mystique, argued that sexist cultural codes prevent women from achieving personal happiness. Friedan, a psychologist by training, focused on the inner lives of white, American, middle-class women at midcentury. More recently, inidualist feminism found a high-profile advocate when Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published her memoir-cum-manifesto Lean In in 2013. Sandberg laments the lack of women in leadership positions, and her book is a how-to manual for women with lofty corporate ambitions.Social feminism has a similarly long, if less well-known, history. Soon after Friedan’s book became a bestseller, Italian feminists such as Leopoldina Fortunati and Silvia Federici began to formulate a different way of looking at the problems that women faced. As Marxists, they sought to analyse how men as a class related to women as a class. They were less interested in ideas of empowerment and self-actualisation than they were in isions of labour, living conditions and cold, hard cash. They argued that so-called “women’s work” – everything from mopping floors to dressing wounds to breastfeeding, cooking, prostitution, laundry and tending to the elderly – should not only be seen as work, but as essential to the capitalist wage-labour system. If men did not have these functions performed for them at home, these women argued, they would not be able to return to work and produce effectively. Male work in the factory relied upon female work in the home.When Federici’s Wages for Housework campaign launched in 1972, it attracted fierce public debate – first in Italy, and then in the US after Federici moved to New York and opened a Wages for Housework office in Brooklyn. The political mainstream found Federici’s idea ridiculous. Could she really mean that a woman should be paid for scrubbing the floors in her husband’s house? But the movement relied on the understanding that a wage was necessary for work to be seen as work, and for the people who did it to be seen as worthy of dignity and protection. More a rhetorical device than an immediate policy prescription, the demand “wages for housework” relied on a conception of women as a “class” in the same sense as a class of workers – a group of people with something in common who could organise on behalf of their shared interests.The Wages for Housework movement fizzled out, but its influence has lived on in campaigns for racial justice, gay rights, housing rights and sex workers’ rights. Behind Wages for Housework lay the idea that women’s oppression was widespread, that it had common features even for women who lived very different lives, and that it was more than just a personal experience – it was a political phenomenon. But because sexism beats so many people down, that also meant that there was a community of women who could pull each other up. Those who experience gendered oppression can band together to end it.Something similar is at stake in #MeToo’s assertions that sexual harassment and assault are systemic, and that women can unite to demand an end to them. While inidualist feminists such as Friedan and Sandberg have examined the problem of sexism by zooming in, to consider women’s psyches and attitudes, Wages for Housework zoomed out, to examine how women were oppressed by the economic forces of capitalism. #MeToo has a less ideological, more ad hoc approach to its analysis of patriarchy. But its gesture proceeds from the assumption that misogyny is structural, and that women have a shared interest in fighting it.This does not mean that #MeToo treats all women’s experiences as the same. The movement has included stories from women of different races, orientations and religions. It has brought testimony from women who are rich and poor, healthy and chronically ill, cis and trans, famous and anonymous. This variety has led to an increasing acknowledgment that misogyny takes different forms, and that not all women have access to the same tools used to mitigate it.At its best, #MeToo’s social feminism has been heavily influenced by black American feminist scholars such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, whose work aims to confront the combined nature of racism and sexism in the lives of black women, and to analyse how, for the people who experience both racism and sexism, the phenomena don’t feel distinct at all. In her 1989 legal article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex, Crenshaw called for a new way of understanding oppression that she referred to as “intersectionality”. Put very simply, this meant taking into account the ways that oppression looks different for different people, and how iniduals experience oppression along more than one axis at once. In practice, Crenshaw’s approach suggests that an effective movement against patriarchal oppression must also confront other systemic inequalities – ones that lend power and viciousness to many women’s experiences of sexism.Intersectionality has given #MeToo a more expansive understanding of sexual harassment and assault. The gesture of saying “me too” implies solidarity with all women who have had these experiences, but the form the movement has taken has also allowed for it to be a specific, personal declaration, and for those testimonies to come from women with different stories and in different circumstances. For every anti-#MeToo feminist who scornfully asks, “Why didn’t you just leave?”, there have been dozens of women explaining the circumstances of their lives that effectively barred the door. Often, these stories have made it heartbreakingly clear that not everyone can risk their job by giving a firm, uncompromising “no” to a handsy boss or coworker that not everyone can afford to call an emergency cab that not everyone has the privileges that make it easy to act in the ways that the inidualist feminists so often prescribe.#MeToo’s sheer number of testimonies has vindicated theories of sexism as a universal, but not uniform, force –that is, as something that every woman will experience, but that every woman will experience in different ways. But in its solidarity, its public gesture of women coming together to demand an end to harassment and assault, the movement also continues the tradition of women’s class consciousness, unity and need for confrontation with systemic injustice. Call it the “too” of #MeToo: the understanding that meaningful liberation from misogyny will only be achieved collectively, with changes at the structural, cultural and institutional levels. Social feminism does not aspire to enable a few women to gain positions of power in patriarchal systems. It’s not about giving women “a seat at the table”. It’s about taking the table apart, so that we can build a new one together.This is not a simple proposition. As an approach, social feminism has real flaws, though its most significant weaknesses are not the ones that #MeToo’s prominent critics choose to address. The real weakness of social feminism is not that it encourages women to be oversensitive about discomforts, but that it is so broad. The call for women to unite can overlook the kinds of pain and conflict that can exist between them.After all, who do we mean when we talk about “women”? What experiences or conditions, exactly, do we identify as common to all women? It is difficult to generalise about so many people at once, and questions of injustice, inequality and privilege mean that doing so puts us at the risk of ignoring vital differences. Women are a varied bunch, and they encounter intersecting oppressions that are not of patriarchy’s exclusive making: racism, classism, ability and sexuality. Often, these oppressions are enforced by other women. There are vast gulfs that separate women from one another: gulfs of racism and money, of colonialism, bigotry, history, resentment, defensiveness, ignorance and hurt. It can be very hard to see each other across them.#MeToo, however, has made it clear that solidarity among women is possible. The working definition of “women”, as #MeToo has constructed it, can be understood simply: as everyone who has experienced misogyny. It’s a bleak kind of solidarity, this acknowledgment of shared suffering. But #MeToo has transformed that mournful acknowledgment into something much more hopeful. If the #MeToo movement has prompted many women to focus on misogynist behaviour with a unifying grief and anger, it has also led many of them to contemplate our shared power and common vision for a different world. When the social feminists of #MeToo call for changes that would make harassment, assault and other forms of misogyny rare, their very act of collective imagining makes such a world more possible: the more we stand together in this demand, the easier it becomes to imagine a world where respect is common, where cruelty is rare, where all of us think with more empathy and intelligence about the lives of others, and where being women will not doom us to suffering or limitation.Again, this is an old debate: whether feminism’s aim should be to transform society, or to better equip inidual women to navigate within it. But why, then, has this clash been framed as generational, when it is clear that the two visions of feminism have been doing battle for decades? Part of it, of course, is ageism and incuriosity – the reflexive tendency to presume that the old are too timid and the young are too reckless. And there is the idea, unique to feminism among all other strands of political thought, that feminism is a social movement that must occur in discrete, coherent and temporal “waves”.But another reason why #MeToo has been framed as a generational conflict is because the inidualist feminists of the anti-#MeToo backlash have framed their own resistance to the movement as grounded in wisdom, realism and, above all, maturity. To them, all this talk of a reimagined, recreated new world sounds hopelessly naive. Daphne Merkin summed up the tenor of the anti-#MeToo assessment in her article in the New York Times, when she wrote to the women coming forward: “Grow up, this is real life”.This is a common, but still very strange belief: that the epitome of maturity and personal strength is the resigned acceptance that the world cannot be better than it is, that we cannot be kinder to one another, that male entitlement, crassness and predation are permanent and unchangeable and must be endured. It is a bizarre conception of strength, one that dismisses as childish weakness any demand for a better world, any hope that things might one day be different. There is a way of thinking that makes this approach by the anti-#MeToo feminists seem strong and pragmatic. But there is another way of thinking that makes it seem very sad.In her book Trauma and Recovery, about the treatment of rape victims and other psychiatric patients who have undergone horrible abuse, the Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman writes of the temptation to sympathise with a patient’s abuser. “It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator,” she writes. “All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing. He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil. The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.” Something similar may be at work in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ desire to advocate for an inidualist feminism. Their call to sympathise more with the perpetrators of sexual assault, and to place greater responsibility for those assaults on the choices of women who experience them, is part of an effort not to feel implicated in the suffering of others, not to share that burden of pain. #MeToo and the reckoning that it has provoked has given us all knowledge we would rather not have – knowledge of just how normal some terrible things are, of just how much some of us have suffered. The anti-#MeToo feminists of the world are not the only ones who feel tempted to look away.

During the 2011 Libyan revolution, documents came to light revealing MI6’s role in the rendition of Belhaj and Boudchar, and a second Libyan opposition figure Sami al-Saadi, who was kidnapped along with his wife and four young children. At this point Straw gave an interview in which he implied that MI6 had not informed him of its involvement.Straw has said that he is prepared to give evidence to the intelligence and security committee, the panel of MPs and peers that provides oversight of the UK’s intelligence agencies. That would be done behind closed doors, however, and some MPs believe Straw needs to be given a chance to give evidence to a parliamentary committee that sits in public.Abdel Hakim Belhaj\u0026nbspand his wife, Fatima Boudchar,\u0026nbspwere the victims of a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of\u0026nbspMI6.They have battled for compensation and an apology for more than six years, after papers that came to light during the Libyan revolution revealed the role that British intelligence officers played in their 2004 kidnap in Thailand.The couple were hooded and shackled and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death.They had sued the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the agency itself and the Foreign Office.\u0026nbspAmong the evidence obtained by Scotland Yard was a faxed letter from Allen to Gaddafi’s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, in which he made clear that MI6 had tipped off the Libyans about the couple’s whereabouts.Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant at the time that she was kidnapped. She was set free shortly before giving birth.Two weeks after the couple were renditioned to Libya,\u0026nbspTony Blair paid his first visit\u0026nbspto the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised “a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism”.\u0026nbspOther documents discovered during the Libyan revolution\u0026nbspmake clear that information extracted from Belhaj was used to justify the detention in Britain of members of his Islamist opposition group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, some of whom had settled in the UK as refugees many years earlier.One shadow minister said: “Now this has been exposed and the government’s role admitted, there has to be an explanation from the iniduals then involved – former and serving civil servants and politicians – about what they knew and when about rendition and torture.“I want to know how complicit the government was, who they were talking to and the details of their relationship with the intelligence services. We need to know how was it allowed to continue and the efforts that were subsequently made to cover it up.“Obviously, as the foreign secretary Jack Straw has many questions to answer. He must now explain what he knew, when he knew it and why his story appears to have changed.”Another shadow minister said: “Rendition has been used to outsource torture and any future Labour government should not be tainted by the actions of former Labour ministers. Straw should come forward and explain himself and get this out in the open.”A veteran Labour MP added: “Any minister who was involved in such an obvious breach of human rights should explain themselves.”Following a Scotland Yard investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that the main suspect – known to be Sir Mark Allen, then head of counter-terrorism at MI6 – had sought political authority for some but not all of his actions. Friends of Straw say that the authorisation that he gave was subsequently “twisted and expanded” by MI6. Human rights groups say there needs to be a broader inquiry, independent of government.Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, called for an independent judicial inquiry into the Libyan renditions and other human rights abuses in the years after 911.“Even now, despite the perseverance and bravery of Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar in seeking an apology, we still don’t know the full facts in this deeply troubling affair,” she said.“We’ve still never had the judicial inquiry into the UK’s role in torture carried out by its partners – including the CIA’s extensive programme of rendition and illegal detention – that we were promised under David Cameron’s government. We still need to know the truth.”13 December 2005 To the Commons foreign affairs committee, after the  had reported that CIA rendition aircraft had been refuelling at UK airports:Unless we start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying, that I am lying, that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States, and also let me say, we believe that Secretary Rice is lying, there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition full stop, because we have not been, and so what on earth a judicial inquiry would start to do I have no idea5 September 2011 In an interview with the BBC, shortly after documents that detailed MI6’s involvement in the kidnap and rendition of two families emerged during the Libyan revolution:No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time10 May 2018 In a statement issued by his lawyers, Kingsley Napley, after Prime Minister Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar that she was “profoundly sorry” for the role that MI6 and the British government played in their kidnap, rendition and torture.Although Straw described the authorisation he gave as being sought on 1 March 2004 with “great urgency”, and the couple were kidnapped by the CIA the following day, Sami al-Saadi and his wife and four young children were not kidnapped until 27 March 2004.After a Scotland Yard investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that Sir Mark Allen of MI6 had “sought political authority” for some, but not all, of his subsequent actions:On 1 March 2004 my approval was sought for some information to be shared with international partners. In almost every case such approvals were made by me in writing, on the basis of written submissions to me. However in rare cases of great urgency, oral submissions could be made and oral approvals given by me.

Carruthers said that as the 10 DUP MPs supported Brexit, “they are not going to tell you anything you haven’t been told before”.Critics said Rees-Mogg’s comments showed he was out of touch and closed-minded. David Parkes, a 25-year-old jockey in Middletown, said he would be happy to speak to Rees-Mogg and explain the impact Brexit was having on border communities. “If you speak to the DUP or Sinn Féin you’re always going to get the same view. If you speak to people who are not political but who live on the border you’ll find out how this area is booming because of the open border and we don’t want that to change. His comments are very arrogant and judgmental,” he said.Martin Eves, who runs Envirogrind, a business operating in the border areas in counties Donegal and Fermanagh, said: “It is typical of the attitude that exist with these people who can get up in the morning and know there is a crisis but fully accept that they will learn nothing from the people on the border. It is a closed mind and you don’t get very far in negotiations with a closed mind.”Paul Butters, spokesman for Best for Britain, a remain campaign group, said: “Rees-Mogg is out of touch and this shows it. He looks foolish. He should visit the border and see the impact of his ideological dogma on the people who live there.”Rees-Mogg’s interview comes amid a flurry of interventions on the Irish issue in the past 48 hours. The former Ulster Unionist party leader David Trimble said on Wednesday that “true friends of Ireland” should “cease the scaremongering”. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was reported in a Daily  article on Friday to have said he feared Brussels would use the border issue to hold Britain hostage in negotiations.Rees-Mogg believes that the border issue can be solved by technology. However, the former prime minister Sir John Major said in a speech at the Irish embassy in London on Thursday night that food checks could not be done by cameras or online, and unless there was regulatory alignment on both sides of the border then inspections posts would be unavoidable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a8a17e2cdff6a33ec9bcf6d7e7508c7c617dd24/0_109_3267_1960/master/3267.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071ee4902e948e93272e93039bd938fa","title":"championship roundup ollie pope century surrey","story":"In the youngster Ollie Pope Surrey have a batsman to watch. The 20-year-old scored his third hundred in 10 first-class matches to turn day one against Yorkshire on its head following a sticky start on an unusually green-tinged pitch.At 69 for four and 162 for six either side of lunch Surrey were struggling after Joe Root’s decision to let the toss go uncontested and bowl first - Root is captaining Yorkshire this weekend following illness to Gary Ballance. A score of 200 was in doubt against a team full of confidence having beaten champions Essex last weekend despite posting 50 in the first innings. But Pope, a calm head on young shoulders, guided Surrey to 366 for seven.Having come in at six, the diminutive former England under-19s right-hander battled hard with his fifth-wicket partner, Dean Elgar, (61) to share 68 before Rikki Clarke dominated a key 129-run stand for the seventh wicket either side of tea, taking the score to 291 for seven.It was only once the belligerent Clarke, who passed 10,000 first-class runs, departed for 71 to Jack Brooks with the second new ball that Pope (131) kicked on, showing the flamboyance which has also made him useful against the white ball. Maybe he will take to 100-ball cricket? That is, of course, as long as it goes ahead. Speaking at tea on BBC Rradio, Surrey’s chief executive, Richard Gould, admitted there is plenty of confusion surrounding the ECB’s plans for the new competition. Asked whether he thought it would go ahead in 2020, he said: “I don’t know.”Earlier Mark Stoneman was lbw to Tim Bresnan for 10, Rory Burns was caught at first slip off Brooks - his 400th first-class victim - for nine and Ben Foakes caught behind off Steve Patterson for 18.The Division One leaders, Nottinghamshire, were bowled out for 133 by Lancashire at Trent Bridge, including two wickets for Jimmy Anderson, before the visitors responded with 157 for four. Haseeb Hameed posted a duck.The champions, Essex, having suffered their first Championship defeat in 19 against Yorkshire, are struggling again, away to Worcestershire. They were b owled out for 177 – Alastair Cook hit 37 – before the hosts responded with 47 for no loss. At Taunton rain meant only 58.1 overs were possible between Hampshire and Somerset, with the visitors 198 for eight. James Vince hit a flighty 44 and Tom Abell took three wickets.In Division Two Eoin Morgan’s 76 for Middlesex (356 for six) against Gloucestershire at Lord’s represented his first Championship fifty since September 2014. Dawid Malan matched him.Fourteen wickets fell on a helter-skelter opening day between the leaders, Warwickshire, and Northamptonshire at Edgbaston. The teenage seamer Henry Brookes was shaping to be the headline act for Warwickshire with four wickets, including three in an opening spell that had the visitors 52 for six and 118 for seven by lunch. But Steven Crook (92) and Doug Bracewell (81) changed the complexion as a stand of 122 pushed them up to 256. They also shared three wickets in Warwickshire’s reply of 100 for four.

Thiem, who lost to Nadal in the Monte Carlo quarter-finals last month, was the last player to beat the Spaniard on clay – at last year’s Rome Masters – and he prevailed in the Spanish capital on Friday, winning 7-5, 6-3.Nadal had set a record of winning 50 consecutive sets on a single surface by beating the Argentinian Diego Schwartzman on Thursday but he was undone by Thiem, who broke the 31-year-old’s serve five times before sealing victory with a powerful cross-court winner in just under two hours. The 24-year-old, seeded fifth, will now face the South African Kevin Anderson in the semi-finals on Saturday. “I haven’t been good enough today,” Nadal said. “Some days you don’t play as good as you would like to play. Also when that happens it’s because your opponent is doing really well.”Roger Federer, who is sitting out the clay-court season, will return to world No\u0026nbsp1 on Monday but Nadal could regain top spot with a win at the Rome Masters, which begins on Sunday.Kyle Edmund’s run at the Madrid Open also came to an end at the quarter-final stage after he was beaten by Canada’s Denis Shapovalov.The British No1 saved a match point at the end of a feisty second set which also involved an incident in which he was distracted by a spectator. But Edmund could not hold off his 19-year-old opponent who broke early in the third and served well to triumph 7-5, 6-7, 6-4.Edmund will take heart from his week, though, especially his memorable win over Novak Djokovic in the earlier rounds.On the women’s side of the draw, Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands continued her sparkling week, securing a place in the final with an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 victory over France’s Caroline Garcia.The unseeded world No\u0026nbsp20 blasted her way past Garcia, the seventh seed, in just over an hour, breaking serve four times and never surrendering a break point to move within sight of her second singles title of the year.The 26-year-old had taken some big scalps already in Madrid, defeating Maria Sharapova in the quarter-finals on Thursday, the day after knocking out the world No\u0026nbsp2 and Australian Open champion, Caroline Wozniacki.“I’m really happy with the way I played. I think it was maybe not great tennis, what people want to see with a lot of winners, but Caroline is a great player,” Bertens said. “Garcia likes when the ball comes from the hip so I was just trying to play as many different balls as I could. I think I did it pretty well.”“She played very well, she used the high ball very well,” said Garcia, of Bertens. “I couldn’t do anything about it.“Of course, I’m frustrated. My performance today was not great. But she had a game plan and it worked well.”Bertens will face a tough examination in Saturday’s final against Petra Kvitova after she beat her Czech compatriot Karolina Pliskova 7-6, 6-3 in Friday’s second semi-final. The victory was Kvitova’s 10th in succession and moves her one step closer to a second successive title after her triumph at last week’s Prague Open.

Stuart Lancaster has only to alight from Leinster’s team bus at Bilbao’s San Mamés stadium rather than walk the trail to Santiago de Compostela but, after two-and-a-half years, his journey to professional redemption is finally complete.The Champions Cup final against Racing 92 is not just about one man but it is a particularly resonant day for England’s erstwhile coach. The last must-win showpiece games his family attended were in 2015 when England were bowing out of their home World Cup at Twickenham. A big occasion for rugby lovers in Dublin, Paris and the Basque country also marks a personally significant return to the sunlit uplands for Lancaster and his wife, Nina, their two children, parents and friends.Those who assume sacked English coaches simply shrug their shoulders and ease into another highly paid role are oblivious to the stark reality. Cumbrian farmers’ sons never wallow in self pity but even Lancaster’s positivity drained away during 2016 when he was jobless with no clear route back into top-level rugby. This week, in a small room on Dublin’s south side, it all finally came tumbling out. “The main thing was a lack of purpose. Not having a team to coach was really eating away at me, not being able to put anything right and just having to sit there thinking about it. It is very difficult when you are out of work.”But for a series of unexpected coincidences, he might still be in Leeds agonising over what might have been. The first emerged on the eve of the 2016 domestic season when Leinster’s defence coach, Kurt McQuilkin, headed back to New Zealand at short notice because his sister was ill. By sheer luck Lancaster used to play with Simon Easterby, Ireland’s forwards coach, whose brother Guy was the Leinster manager. When Lancaster’s name first came up in the Ireland office, the nearest man across the desk was Andy Farrell, previously a member of his England coaching staff.Even now Lancaster sounds immensely grateful: “If this role hadn’t come up, I don’t know how it would have played out. There was certainly nothing else in the pipeline. There was no time for ‘Am I or am I not good enough to be coaching at this level?’ It was a case of: ‘You’re in because we’re at Glasgow on Friday.’”The existence of direct flights from Leeds to Dublin also avoided having to uproot his two children, Sophie and Dan, from their A-level studies. All those dawn airport dashes through the snow to catch his twice-weekly flights have been worth it. At his first team meeting, Lancaster told the players they could win in Europe – “My opening line was: ‘I think we can do great things here’”– and now they are 80 minutes from doing so for the first time since 2012. Their still-improving squad are increasingly the envy of Europe and the players are glowing about Lancaster’s technical input. Among the believers is their tactical kingpin Johnny Sexton, another instrumental figure in his recruitment.“Johnny texted me and said: ‘Let me know what you need me to do to help get it over the line.’ That is pretty powerful coming from a guy who we’d played against five times with England.”Which begs several tantalising questions. Could it be that Lancaster would make a better international coach now than the less experienced model hired by England after the incident-packed 2011 World Cup campaign in New Zealand? Ireland have already drafted in Farrell and, after 2019, there are likely to be a number of vacancies in all sorts of interesting places.Alternatively – “I really enjoy the day-to-day element of club coaching” – could this most approachable and personable of sporting figures may yet conclude he is naturally more suited to club and provincial team preparation? As things stand, it gives him the same match-day buzz without the managerial distractions that restricted the amount of hands-on coaching he did with England. Wherever he goes next, he has promised not to make that same mistake again.Not being the formal number one – with Leo Cullen the Leinster director of rugby – also does not bother him. “I am quite happy to take on responsibility and decision-making if needs be but I don’t have to be the number one. Wayne Smith is a good example. He was coaching New Zealand, then he went to Northampton, then he came back and worked under Graham Henry. I don’t want to give the impression I wouldn’t want to go back and be a number one at some point but it works at the moment for me. As long as I’ve got a strong role that would be fine.”He does admit that watching England from afar can still be tricky, particularly when a Leinster-heavy Ireland beat his former charges at Twickenham in March. “You can’t help but look and see how the team are doing. You are so invested in it.” Lancaster’s team never lost three championship games on the trot or finished fifth but he remains faithful to the players.“England are still a great team. I wouldn’t read too much into the Six Nations, it came down to small margins. I would never not want England to do well, particularly when I know how hard the players worked in 2012-15. What happened in the World Cup hurts them just as much as it hurts me.”Ah, the World Cup. Maybe a Leinster win would alleviate some of the pain that clearly lingers. “Obviously I still look back with huge regret that we didn’t do better. Things didn’t go well for about half an hour of the Wales game and that changed everything.”In a results-based business, the fallout was never going to be pretty. “It’s tough, particularly for my parents, when criticism is coming your way. I would look at other coaches and feel for them because it’s difficult to get back.”All of which makes his family’s presence – minus his daughter who turned 18 this week – in the San Mamés stands all the more special. Despite his protests to the contrary – “It’s more about repaying Leinster than vindication” – one of modern sport’s most heart-warming comeback stories now awaits its conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a43d694ecf6e2e168e00f52358176845b7f906/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c136b8e25e2cd9c0f2af21504c53701","title":"nine endorphin boosting ideas to get you outdoors this spring and summer","story":"Time outdoors has a hugely positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing.

Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes. They include the South West Coast Path, with 630 miles of trails snaking around the Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset coasts, and northern England’s hilly Pennine Way.Get started: National Trails (nationaltrail). In addition, Ramblers (ramblers.org.uk) has suggestions for hiking routes on its website.Combine your love of music with the outdoorsPack your tent and wellington boots and head for one of the country’s iconic music festivals this summer. These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location. Glastonbury is taking a break in 2018, but there are many others picking up the slack, from Bestival to Latitude, the Isle of Wight festival, V and many more. Pray for sunshine, but come prepared for rain.Get started: The Festival Calendar (thefestivalcalendar) has comprehensive listings for 2018’s summer festivals, with links to festival websites and ticket sales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9796ff4f951f684fcf525824f261803eeff90a6c/0_124_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f42f49fd67009f62d320830f2b8c0e","title":"ten of the best arts and culture experiences for spring and summer","story":"Open-air film screenings, festivals and craft fairs – it’s time to take your love of arts and culture outdoorsCatch Shakespeare in the parkFrom The Sound of Music to Lord of the Flies, Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in London has played host to some of the capital’s brightest and boldest stage shows since 1932 – no mean feat when the whole thing is outside. Whatever the weather this summer, Shakespeare comedy As You Like It lends itself so well to the enchanting backdrop you’ll feel like you’re in the mythical Forest of Arden itself. Sit back and immerse yourself in an evening of love, laughter and classic lines like, “All the world’s a stage.” And the dreamy musical score – comprising brand new tunes from former Noah and the Whale frontman Charlie Fink – isn’t bad either.openairtheatre 06-28 JulyHead to the hottest art showWhat could be better than an exhibition of work from one of the 20th century’s greatest artists? A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea. Bring it on.narcissusflowers 21 June (and various dates)Learn a new craftStep away from the sandy beaches and seafood and head straight to The Studio at Burlingham Hall in Norfolk to get your hands – rather than your toes – dirty this summer. Artist Victoria Hall runs a two-day workshop for beginners in the art of paper marbling at this picturesque country estate. You’ll learn about the history, get familiar with watercolours, and tackle various paper patterns (including curl and comb designs). In fact, you’ll have a range of eclectic designs under your belt by the end. And if you don’t leave feeling like a born-again artist, you’ll certainly have the materials to make some pretty alternative Christmas cards.burlinghamhall 16-17 AugustGo down to the woodsHead to the Latitude festival for late-night poetry, light installations, and the biggest comedy, theatre, and arts line up in its 12-year history. Held in Suffolk’s picturesque Henham Park, Latitude is renowned for its eclectic arts programme, with a bit of yoga and lake swimming thrown in for good measure. This year it’s all about Bridget Christie and Tim Key in the comedy selection, while the Killers and Alt-J are definitely headliners to be reckoned with. But it’s the addition of enigmatic music and fashion icon Solange to the bill – her first time heading up a UK festival – that’ll be a real feast of the senses.latitudefestival 12-15 JulyFill up at a foodie festivalIs your idea of heaven on a hot day hitting up a beer garden? Then Pub in the Park is for you. Launched last summer by chef Tom Kerridge to celebrate great British chefs, pubs and music, this year sees the festival go on tour. There are four locations – Higginson Park in Marlow, Royal Victoria Park in Bath, Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells and Knutsford, Cheshire – to choose from. Dishes from Kerridge’s own Michelin-starred Marlow pubs The Hand and Flowers and The Coach will pop up at the four festivals, alongside others from throughout Britain, and there’ll be chef demonstrations and a whole foodie village to shop in. Let’s not forget the soundtrack – brought to you live by the likes of Tom Odell and Razorlight.www.pubintheparkuk various dates between 17 May and 9 SeptemberSee a film under the starsIf you see one film this summer, just make sure it is outdoors. When it’s warm outside (and even when it’s not) there is no shortage of quirky film events, but Picnic Cinema – run by the arts organisation and charity Eden Arts, in Penrith, Cumbria – pulls out all the stops. You can dress up, bring your own picnic (the clue is in the title), and even sleep over. With music, dancing and surprise entertainment, amid spectacular scenic views, you may even forget you’re there to watch a film. Last year, revellers got suitably attired for Pulp Fiction, Withnail and I and The Wicker Man so we can’t wait to see what this year has in store. Just don’t forget your torch.picniccinema various datesJoin the circusIf you’ve ever dreamed of running away with the circus, now’s your chance. To mark 250 years since “the father of modern circus”, Philip Astley, pioneered this industry in London in 1768, Somerset House (in conjunction with Somerset House-based creative producers Crying Out Loud) will present two weekends of contemporary circus, hip-hop dance and music in the iconic grounds. Don’t miss the trailblazing Gandini Juggling performing a special commission, Cascade, in the fountain courtyard juggling within water jets to the sound of brass music will be a mesmerising sight to behold.somersethouse.org.uk 28-29 July 4-5 AugustGo to a literary festivalIf curling up with a hardback is your idea of heaven in the winter months, then flopping in a deckchair in the village of Hay-on-Wye should probably rate quite highly on your summer to-do list. Not that you’ll have much time to sit with your head in a book at Hay festival Wales, where Margaret Atwood leads a stellar line up of about 800 inspirational, thought-provoking discussions and panels. She’ll speak on The Handmaid’s Tale and beyond, while Philip Pullman, joined by Marina Warner and folklore academic Jack Zipes, promise tales of wonder, magic, and hope. Don’t miss the brilliant Letters Live, which returns for a fifth year.hayfestival 24 May-3 JuneWatch iconic bandsWhen it’s live music you want, settling on which summer festival to go to can be tricky, but this year’s Isle of Wight festival will take that decision out of your hands. It’s a special one, marking 50 years since its inauguration, and as a result, the festival has been appealing for stories from anyone who was there in 1968, watching Jefferson Airplane and T Rex et al. This year’s line-up also nods to nostalgia, with performances from Depeche Mode and Van Morrison.isleofwightfestival 21-24 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0fce353b706d628fbb5da846655aac28ae4e75a/121_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6ec4b99ab3da72b1126f12db5016954","title":"its like a labyrinth netflixs new true doc takes on the pizza bomber","story":"Trey Borzillieri and Barbara Schroeder, the duo behind the new series Evil Genius, speak about one of America’s strangest criminal plots and its fascinating perpetratorsWith its ever-expanding repertoire of original films, TV series, standup specials, and talkshows, Netflix makes it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. Amid all the content, though, the streaming site has steadily made its own canon of true-crime documentaries, owing to an array of innately fascinating subjects that lend themselves to binge-watching.First there was Making a Murderer, which cast doubt on a Wisconsin man’s conviction, followed by The Keepers, about the unsolved murder of a nun, and Wild, Wild Country, the story of the Oregon-based Rajneeshpuram sex cult. Now, Mark and Jay Duplass, the producers of Wild, Wild Country, boast a second, equally strange true-crime hit: Evil Genius, the bizarre tale of the “pizza bomber” heist in the appropriately named town of Erie, Pennsylvania.It begins, as those watching the news in the late summer of 2003 will remember, with a rather fruitless bank robbery: a pizza delivery man named Brian Wells walked into a PNC bank in Erie with a metal bomb collared to his neck and a cane-like shotgun in tow. Making off with about $8,000, Wells was apprehended shortly afterward in a nearby parking lot, where he told surrounding cops that the bomb around his neck was live. Incredulous witnesses heard a continuous “tick-tock”, and then it detonated, lodging shrapnel in Wells’ chest and killing him. In Wells’ car, though, authorities recovered notes that laid out a scavenger hunt, suggesting he was just a cog in an elaborate criminal machine.“I learned about it the night that it happened,” says Trey Borzillieri, the creator of Evil Genius, who’s spent more than a decade investigating the heist and its aftermath. “I was in Buffalo, which is very close to Erie, and I saw it become an international story. You’ve basically got Brian Wells delivering that pizza and then showing up at a PNC bank and robbing it. They start the investigation, then a month later there’s a body in a freezer right next to the road he made the last delivery to.“At the time, you knew this was a major story,” he adds. “So that was the moment I decided to embark on this documentary.”Borzillieri, who last year produced a docu-series on the Zodiac killer, would make the acquaintance of a remarkably idiosyncratic cast of characters along the way, none more compelling than Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, the owl-eyed local pseudo-celebrity known for a streak of suborned, and often murdered, ex-boyfriends. An erstwhile beauty queen and musical prodigy diagnosed with bipolar disorder and mania, Diehl-Armstrong is the undisputed star of Evil Genius, if not exactly its subject, a shrewd manipulator who’s more Nannie Doss than Aileen Wuornos.“She’s very smart people would call her brilliant,” says Barbara Schroeder, who joined Borzillieri on the project in 2013. Schroeder, who wrote and directed the documentary Talhotblond, about an internet love triangle that goes south, was intrigued by the access her collaborator got to Diehl-Armstrong, whose first on-camera interview is featured in Evil Genius.“She was able to get men to do her bidding and put them under her spell,” Schroeder says. “I’m an experienced journalist, so when Trey was telling me he had years of phone calls with someone who might be the mastermind, that was just astonishing. I started listening to the audio that he got and it was just riveting.” Borzillieri and Diehl-Armstrong established a relationship before she was a public suspect, which meant she often used him as a sounding board to profess her innocence. Nevertheless, she was still a wildcard. After one phone conversation with Borzillieri, she told him: “I’ll sue your fucking balls off.” In another, she signed off with: “Love ya!” Borzillieri says: “They weren’t easy conversations, but a lot of truth was revealed … She was such a narcissist that she always believed people would believe her side of the story.”Weeks after the Wells heist, local law enforcement received a call from Bill Rothstein, a kind of Falstaff in overalls. Portly and gregarious, Rothstein was another ex-boyfriend of Diehl-Armstrong’s who lived nextdoor to the site of Wells’s final delivery and alerted authorities to the body of James Roden, which was frozen stiff in a freezer in his garage. Roden, too, was an ex of Diehl-Armstrong’s.“The case was cold, and it looked like Rothstein would be a definite suspect,” Borzillieri recalls. “The fact that the body was the live-in boyfriend of Marjorie’s at the time, you thought this had to be connected. But when the FBI said that it wasn’t, that’s what really compelled me to get off the couch and start knocking on doors.”Mostly, those doors begat more doors. Rich Shapiro, whose 2010 Wired exposé examines the heist comprehensively, told Borzillieri and Schroeder he needed a flow chart just to keep things straight. So, to make Evil Genius, the pair stayed faithful to chronology. They were inspired, first, by Paradise Lost, the celebrated documentary about the West Memphis Three, and second by the philosophical principle of Occam’s razor, which posits that the simplest approach is usually the best.“It was like a labyrinth, because there is more to the story than just Brian’s death,” Schroeder says. “It could have been written a lot of different ways, but we kept it really simple: here’s the heist, here’s the frozen body, here are the suspects, and here are the confessions. We thought it would be the most engaging way for people to follow Trey’s journey and these social misfits who basically outplayed the FBI.”Among the many subnarratives coursing through the docuseries, which touches on issues of class stratification and mental illness, is the tension between the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and local law enforcement, whose collective attempts to solve the mystery of the heist were marred by a lack of forensic evidence, the deaths of key witnesses, and their own internecine disputes. “This is the first time that many of these investigators have gone on camera to tell their story,” says Borzillieri. “Because of the sensitive nature of this case, all law enforcement you see interviewed waited until they were retired to speak.”The access Borzillieri secured, including unprecedented on-camera interviews with law enforcement, Diehl-Armstrong, and a key witness who surfaces in the fourth episode, reflected the kind of genuine, leather-shoe reporting he conducted from the get-go. “Even though he’s a citizen journalist, I enjoyed working with him more than a lot of other colleagues throughout my career,” says Schroeder. “The first time anybody tells their story, if you catch that on camera, that’s a pretty special moment. To Trey’s credit, it’s good old-fashioned journalism.”Borzillieri and Schroeder are happy that Evil Genius landed at Netflix, where true-crime junkies will be able to binge all four episodes in full. “We’re grateful to get that many eyeballs on this one-of-a-kind crime,” says Schroeder, “and, creatively, to be able to tell the story the way it should be told.”“I would add that, embarking on this, there weren’t a lot of documentary series at the time,” Borzillieri notes. “There was a lot of blind faith on my part. Making a Murderer revolutionized this kind of film-making and, in essence, I no longer look like a crazy person carrying a project like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e0f3130b4832009d9b0cbb2d40b4b1a4ff6bdb9/0_395_3715_2228/master/3715.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976932b1c29701ba7f0c5d948a3894f7","title":"europe prepares countermeasures against us iran sanctions","story":"Senior politicians says Europe will consider countermeasures to keep trading with IranEurope is prepared to introduce measures to nullify the effect of Donald Trump imposing sanctions on any non-US firm that continues to do business with Iran, the French government has said.The warning from the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, suggests Trump’s proposals to corral Europe into joining US foreign policy on Iran may lead to a severe backlash by EU firms and politicians, especially advocates of a stronger independent European foreign policy.“We have to work among ourselves in Europe to defend our European economic sovereignty,” Le Maire said, adding that Europe could use the same instruments as the US to defend its interests. Speaking on Europe 1 he added: “Do we want to be a vassal that obeys and jumps to attention?”When Trump announced he was pulling the US out of the Iran nuclear deal he said the US was also reimposing sanctions, including on any entity that continued to trade with Iran, in effect threatening billions of euros of European business.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.The US Treasury has said it is giving companies three to six months to wind down their contracts, including purchases of Iranian oil.On Friday Le Maire put forward three main proposals starting with an EU-wide blocking statute similar to an EU regulation passed in 1996 designed to nullify any US sanctions imposed on EU firms. The statute permitted European companies to ignore the US sanctions and said that any decisions by foreign courts based on the such sanctions would not be upheld in Europe. The US backed down before any sanctions were implemented.“We want to reinforce this regulation and incorporate the recent decisions taken by the United States,” Le Maire said.He added: “The second avenue is looking at Europe’s financial independence – what can we do to give Europe more financial tools allowing it to be independent from the United States?” One proposal is to set up a purely European finance house to oversee euro-denominated transactions with Iran.He also proposed a European agency capable of following the activities of foreign companies. Le Maire said he would meet with German and British finance ministers at the end of the month to discuss these proposals.Le Maire disclosed that he had already called the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, urging him to allow exemptions for French companies or a delay in implementing the sanctions, while admitting he had “few illusions” about the likely response.The UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson will meet his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian in London on Monday to discuss the Iran crisis. Le Drian has already described the US extraterritorial sanctions as unacceptable, saying European business should not be required to pay for US foreign policy decisions.A week of intensive diplomacy will continue on Tuesday when the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif meets his European counterparts in Brussels. The Iranian government issued a lengthy statement on Friday saying Europe needed “to move from giving pledges to taking practical steps without any preconditions”.German chancellor Angela Merkel said possibilities to save the deal without Washington needed to be discussed with Tehran, while economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said Germany was ready to give help to its affected firms, including legal advice, to continue doing business in Iran.The new US ambassador to Germany was forced on to the defensive this week after sending out a tweet telling German businesses they should wind down their links with Iran.Richard Grenell said he had been issuing advice, not instructions, and his remarks derived from a Washington memo.Omid Nouripour, the Green foreign policy spokesperson in the German parliament, advised Grenell against “driving a ruthless aggressive policy towards our security interests”. The Social Democrats said Grenell needed tutoring in diplomacy.In Italy, Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to the EU external affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran deal was “an utter and unjustified betrayal of Europe”. She called for proportionate reprisals if necessary.The EU and US combined to impose sanctions against Iran between 2012 and 2015. After the Iran deal was struck in 2015, the Obama administration worked with European banks to reassure them that some US sanctions that remained in force did not restrict the rights of European business.The former US ambassador to Italy, David Thorne, said Trump’s decision had the potential to cause the biggest rift between the US and mainland Europe since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Europe needed to produce a counter-package against the US, including penalties against assets of US companies based in Europe to allow for clawback of illegal fines imposed.The UK is not as heavily involved in Iranian trade as France, Germany and Italy, partly because UK finance houses are so strongly intertwined with the US, and therefore vulnerable to fines if they are deemed to have breached sanctions.The sanctions policy gives the US Treasury considerable latitude to interpret whether a firm is doing its best to unravel its business links, but previous fines for alleged breaches led many firms to err on the side of caution.

The US embassy Twitter account – previously in Tel Aviv as @usembassytlv – is now @usembassyjlm.All is set for the inauguration on Monday, an opening charged with symbolism that its organisers anticipate will set off a wave of euphoria across the Jewish state 70 years since it declared independence on 14 May 1948.Hundreds of guests will attend, alongside a White House delegation led by John Sullivan, US deputy secretary of state, and including the much higher-profile Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.For Israel’s prime minister, the embassy move is seen as one of two gifts from Donald Trump to the country, the other being his exit this week from the Iran nuclear deal that will reimpose sanctions on Benjamin Netanyahu’s arch-enemy.Yet a celebratory atmosphere masks a particularly feverish time for Israel, even, some say, by historical standards.To Israel’s south, the army has been lambasted internationally for its lethal response to Palestinian protests that have not relented for weeks. To the north, and for the first time in decades, the country is facing the possibility of on-off interstate war.Trump’s decision to recognise the holy city as Israel’s capital was made in stark defiance of long-held international consensus that the status of ided Jerusalem should be negotiated with the Palestinians.Senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath, speaking near the site of the new embassy, said Trump was “siding totally with Israeli annexation and Israeli cleansing of our people from Jerusalem”.As the US president’s daughter attends the pomp, less than 60 miles away, a six-week protest spurred on by anger and desperation at Trump’s embassy decision is expected to culminate in a mass demonstration in Gaza.Next week has added significance for millions of Palestinians, who will mark seven decades since the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people who either fled or were forced from their homes during the war surrounding Israel’s creation.Gaza’s protesters have vowed to break through the perimeter fence despite the presence of Israeli snipers deployed on sandbanks behind it.The Gaza-based leader of Hamas, which rules the enclave, said the rallies would be peaceful but would not be held back. “What’s the problem if hundreds of thousands storm this fence which is not a border of a state?” Yahya Sinwar said, claiming the frontier was not internationally recognised.Israel’s use of live ammunition against unarmed masses has killed dozens of Palestinians, including journalists, and wounded around 1,700, including children shot in the legs. On Friday, Israeli troops killed one protester and wounded 49 others, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The Israeli military said 15,000 Palestinian “rioters” had taken part and thrown “pipe bombs and grenades” towards Israeli troops. No Israeli has been wounded during the six-week movement.In stark contrast to that of the White House, the general international reaction to the Israeli army’s actions has been condemnatory. In a separate move defying global allies, Trump effectively pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, a decision that has shaken an already turbulent Middle East.On Thursday, Israel accused Tehran’s forces of launching a barrage of rockets at its troops in the occupied Golan Heights. Iran did not confirm it had fired but the incident follows reports of multiple unclaimed and surreptitious Israeli strikes on Tehran’s outposts in Syria this year.Saying it was retaliating against the rockets, Israel launched a massive operation on its Arab neighbour – the largest in Syria since the early 70s.The Israel Defence Forces claimed its missiles hit nearly all key Iranian military targets in Syria during dozens of strikes. The operation, nicknamed “house of cards”, was lauded by unnamed military officials in local media as a huge success against its enemies.Ahead of the embassy opening, others have cautioned against jubilation over the US pullout of the Iran deal and the Israeli attack in Syria.“In Israel these days, Benjamin Netanyahu is king and Donald Trump is a god. Adrenaline is flowing through the nation’s veins and testosterone could soon spill over,” wrote Chemi Shalev, the US editor for the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Iran’s foreign ministry said the raids in Syria were launched on “invented pretexts” and that Damascus had every right to defend itself. In a more defiant tone, a senior Iranian cleric close to the leadership, Ahmad Khatami, was quoted on state TV as saying: “We will expand our missile capabilities despite western pressure.”Ben Caspit, a prominent Israeli journalist, described a national mindset of elation in Maariv, one of the country’s oldest daily newspapers, saying if Israel were playing a football game, the score would be “10-0 in our favour”.“The problem is that the final whistle can’t be blown any more,” he wrote. “The dangerous game that we have been drawn into can turn against us at any moment. It has no set or clear rules ... The security establishment knows that this wasn’t even the first half of the game.

File photograph: Getty ImagesTwo cabin crew members on a Ryanair flight fell to the floor and one broke an ankle after the pilot pulled too hard on the aircraft’s manual controls when it began to “overspeed” during a descent in a jetstream. The Boeing 737-8AS registered to Ryanair in Dublin was descending into Manchester Airport on the evening of January 14th, 2017, when the incident occurred, according to a report by the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).It said that while descending into a high altitude jetstream, an associated rise in headwind caused the aircraft to overspeed.“The commander disengaged the autopilot and used manual control inputs to stop the speed increasing, but in doing so applied a significant nose-up pitch input on the control column. The resulting manoeuvre caused two cabin crew members to fall, and one of them sustained a broken ankle. The operator (Ryanair) has issued additional guidance to its pilots regarding overspeed recognition and recovery,” the report said. The 31-year-old commander, who had flown 4,997 total flight hours, reported that “because the autopilot appeared not to be correcting the condition, and thinking that he had little time to react, he simultaneously pressed the autopilot disengage button on his control wheel and pulled back on the control column”.“His intention was to avoid the overspeed as smoothly as possible using manual control inputs.”The investigation found there were “marked changes in the normal acceleration of the aircraft over a short period”. Technical data showed that in the one second during which the autopilot was disengaged, the force exerted on the control column by the pilot changed from -0.51 lbs to +42.76 lbs.“The commander reported that he was aware of the possibility of encountering a jetstream in the descent, but had not seen the airspeed increase to this extent before,” the report said. He suspected that a phenomenon known as “startle effect” had caused him to exert more force on the control column than intended. This effect is described as a reflex action elicited by exposure to a “sudden, intense event that violates a pilot’s expectations”. Since the incident, both pilots on the flight had undergone simulator training focused on overspeed recovery, the AAIB said. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, had also indicated it was aware of other similar occurrences.In March 2017, a Boeing 737 encountered an increasing headwind during descent which resulted in indications that the aircraft would overspeed, the report said.The pilot in control responded with a manual control input which caused the autopilot to disengage. Two cabin crew members suffered injuries during the resulting aircraft manoeuvre.The commander on the January 2017 flight told the investigators he had learned from the experience, particularly in relation to the handling sensitivities of the aircraft at high altitudes.In its conclusions, the investigation body said the serious injuries suffered by a cabin crew member occurred “because significant manual control inputs were applied in response to an impending overspeed, which resulted in the aircraft manoeuvring abruptly”.“An increasing headwind associated with a jetstream had caused the airspeed to rise. The narrow speed margins and handling sensitivities of the aircraft at high altitudes were contributory factors.”Boeing said it was considering a revision to the overspeed guidance in the 737 flight crew training manual.

Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3491757.1526041787!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tweet from tony o brien criticised by politicians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O’Brien is to stand aside from his position on Friday after weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck programme. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe A tweet from the director general of the Health Service Executive Tony O’Brien has been strongly criticised by politicians.Mr O’Brien is to stand aside from his position on Friday after weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck programme.On Friday morning, he tweeted: “When I appear in public - say at a Committee I conduct myself against a simple standard. Would I be happy for my children or my mother to see how I behave? I sometimes look across the room and hope their children will never see and hear how they behave.”This appears to be a reference to his appearance before the Oireachtas Public Accounts committee on Thursday morning, where he faced intense questioning from members.However, Mr MacSharry insisted this was not about Mr O’Brien claiming the director general has failed to realise that. “The taxpayer pays my wages. They also pay Mr O’Brien’s. They have a right to criticise, question us and scrutinise the decisions we make.

Photograph: Dave MeehanThe Taoiseach has backed the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan after it emerged he received memos in 2016 showing delays in women with cancer being told about false smear tests.Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris, however, warned that nobody was immune from being held to account for their role in the failure to disclose incorrect tests by the CervicalCheck screening programme.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin on Friday, Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris both expressed confidence in Dr Holohan, the Government’s most senior adviser on health matters.Both politicians said that any conclusion on the role played by people involved in the controversy should wait until the results of the scoping inquiry led by public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally – which is due to report by the end of June – and the follow-up commission of investigation.“Everyone deserves due process and a fair hearing and that’s exactly what these investigations will do,” Mr Varadkar told reporters.He sought to push any conclusions being reached on others outside the political system where on Thursday, hours after heated exchanges at the Public Accounts Committee, Health Service Executive director general Tony O’Brien resigned following the publication of the 2016 memos.Asked whether Mr O’Brien received a fair hearing, the Taoiseach said he did and that “he went by his own volition”. “Everybody who has had any role in this will have to account for their role,” said Mr Harris, noting that people would have to hand over all relevant documents to the Scally inquiry.“Then we will make an informed judgment when we have seen all of those pieces of the jigsaw in relation to exactly who knew what when, and what was behind the decisions at the time,” he said.Mr Harris suggested that nobody, no matter how senior and including officials within the Department of Health, the HSE and other agencies, would be immune from being held to account for their actions.“There are other people who work in the public service and civil service, in jobs that are also well remunerated, that also have accountability,” he said.Dr Holohan’s role in the controversy came into focus on Thursday when the department said he received a March 2016 memo that called for a suspension in letters being sent about false tests. A week before the memos became public, Dr Holohan said he only learned of the non-disclosure of information to women involved two weeks ago after the settlement of the High Court case taken by terminally ill Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, who exposed the controversy. On the March 2016 memo, Dr Holohan told the Public Accounts Committee on Thursday: “I can’t honestly tell you whether I saw this specific memo or not, but the general information that it includes is not in broad terms new information to me.”In response to queries from The , the Department of Health argued that there has been no contradiction in the public statements made by Dr Holohan.“The purpose of the March 2016 memo was to raise awareness of the audit process. It refers to delays (pauses) caused by legal issues, which were subsequently resolved, and makes no reference to non-disclosure,” said the department.It added that the first knowledge that Dr Holohan had of non-disclosure to patients was on April 26th and the full extent of it became clear on April 29th.Both Mr Varadkar, who was minister for health at the time of the March 2016 memo, and Mr Harris, who succeeded him, both welcomed the department’s statement on Thursday that the memos did not reach them.“I am really annoyed,” said Mr Harris of his failure to be notified about the memos. “How could you not be? I would have liked to have known about this.” That the memos were sitting in his department was “a cause of concern”, he added.Asked if any of his advisers knew, the Taoiseach said: “Not to my knowledge.” They all confirmed to him that they had not seen the memos, he said. CervicalCheck programme manager John Gleeson, who “prepared” one of the July 2016 memos, declined to say whether he was also the author of the unsigned March 2016 memo. When asked by The  whether he wrote the memo, the HSE press office replied on his behalf: “All these matters are subject to the Scally review. The HSE will cooperate fully with the review in all regards.”The HSE said that it was always the intention for the letters to be released about the tests “as speedily as possible”, but the laboratories that carried out the tests raised legal issues, forcing the HSE to seek legal advice.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Revealed: How Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal wedding guests put charity centre stageWaitrose accused of copying Hotel Chocolat chocolate barsThe Bridge, series 4 episode 1: it was a violent return for poor Saga NorénPolice arrest 14-year-old boy after 15-year-old shot at school in Palmdale, CaliforniaHospital shops warned over \u0026#39jacked-up\u0026#39 prices as patients are charged £8 for an 80p tube of toothpaste Congo operation launched to rescue two British tourists kidnapped at Virunga wildlife parkComment: Using Parliamentary privilege to fight the Brexit war is an abuse of powerSingle women are a \u0026#39burden on the state\u0026#39 says Japanese MP amid tumbling birth rateMichael Portillo\u0026#39s father is accused of inventing Spanish Civil War speechCheeki Rafiki yacht boss spared prison as judge criticises him for not leaving pub during tragedyPlan to re-open steam train line leaves farmers fumingUN nuclear watchdog\u0026#39s inspections chief quits after US withdrawal from Iran dealGeorge Osborne speaks of his delight after discovering he is JewishCalls for urgent investigation to explain 20,000 additional deathsScientists to develop Neanderthal \u0026#39miniature brains\u0026#39Bafta TV Awards 2018: Who will win, and who should win?Drones banned from Windsor during Royal wedding weekend due to privacy and security concernsTheresa May\u0026#39s desperate last roll of the dice to break customs union impasseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11 may 2018","story":"Tiger triplets, Salisbury Cathedral and Bella Hadid are among Friday\u0027s Pictures of the DayNasa is sending a helicopter to search the skies over MarsRevealed: How Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal wedding guests put charity centre stageWaitrose accused of copying Hotel Chocolat chocolate barsThe Bridge, series 4 episode 1: it was a violent return for poor Saga NorénPolice arrest 14-year-old boy after 15-year-old shot at school in Palmdale, CaliforniaHospital shops warned over \u0026#39jacked-up\u0026#39 prices as patients are charged £8 for an 80p tube of toothpaste Congo operation launched to rescue two British tourists kidnapped at Virunga wildlife parkComment: Using Parliamentary privilege to fight the Brexit war is an abuse of powerSingle women are a \u0026#39burden on the state\u0026#39 says Japanese MP amid tumbling birth rateMichael Portillo\u0026#39s father is accused of inventing Spanish Civil War speechCheeki Rafiki yacht boss spared prison as judge criticises him for not leaving pub during tragedyPlan to re-open steam train line leaves farmers fumingUN nuclear watchdog\u0026#39s inspections chief quits after US withdrawal from Iran dealGeorge Osborne speaks of his delight after discovering he is JewishCalls for urgent investigation to explain 20,000 additional deathsScientists to develop Neanderthal \u0026#39miniature brains\u0026#39Bafta TV Awards 2018: Who will win, and who should win?Drones banned from Windsor during Royal wedding weekend due to privacy and security concernsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/11/TELEMMGLPICT000163105761_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"single women burden state says japanese mp amid tumbling birth","story":"The falling birth rate in Japan comes despite financial and other incentives designed to encourage young couples to have childrenA politician from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has issued a reluctant apology after suggesting that single women are a burden on the state.Kanji Kato, 72, was accused of sexism for telling newlyweds that they need to have at least three children and those who fail to have large enough families will end up living in nursing homes paid for with other people’s taxes.Mr Kato made the comments in a meeting on Thursday of a faction of the LDP. A number of female politicians at the event immediately condemned the attitude of Mr Kato - who has six children and eight grandchildren - with one woman telling Kyodo News “This is exactly sexual harassment”.Mr Kato’s comments have provoked a storm of criticism in a nation that is wrestling with a sharply contracting birth rate, an aging population and shrinking tax revenues. It has also been wracked by scandals involving sexism in politics, the media and the world of entertainment.“I always tell brides and grooms at wedding parties that I would like them to have three or more children”, Mr Kato said. “We need three or more children from those people to make up for couple who cannot bear a child no matter what they do”.Those who fail to meet Mr Kato’s suggested quota will live on pensions and receive health care paid for with the taxes of other people’s children, he said.Challenged about whether he would amend or retract his advice, Mr Kato was unapologetic.“Improving the birth rate is the most important issue facing our nation. That is all”, he said.Under pressure from senior LDP members, however, Mr Kato’s office issued a statement later in the day in which he said, “I apologise if my words game the wrong impression. Although I never intended to discriminate against women, I retract the remarks I made because they could have been interpreted as such”.Around 941,000 children were born in Japan last year, the lowest figure since nation-wide records were first collated in 1899. Government data released on April 1 showed there were 15.53 million children under the age of 15, down 170,000 from the previous year and also the lowest figure on record.The falling birth rate comes despite financial and other incentives designed to encourage young couples to have children. Japanese are today getting married later in life, more women are opting for a career over a family and the expense of raising children makes larger families prohibitively expensive for most.Mr Kato’s comments echo those of a number of other LDP members in the past, including Hakuo Yanagisawa, the former minister of health who in 2007 described woman as “baby-making machines” who are duty-bound to increase the population.Please review our commenting policyNasa is sending a helicopter to search the skies over MarsRevealed: How Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal wedding guests put charity centre stageWaitrose accused of copying Hotel Chocolat chocolate barsThe Bridge, series 4 episode 1: it was a violent return for poor Saga NorénPolice arrest 14-year-old boy after 15-year-old shot at school in Palmdale, CaliforniaHospital shops warned over \u0026#39jacked-up\u0026#39 prices as patients are charged £8 for an 80p tube of toothpaste Congo operation launched to rescue two British tourists kidnapped at Virunga wildlife parkComment: Using Parliamentary privilege to fight the Brexit war is an abuse of powerMichael Portillo\u0026#39s father is accused of inventing Spanish Civil War speechCheeki Rafiki yacht boss spared prison as judge criticises him for not leaving pub during tragedyPlan to re-open steam train line leaves farmers fumingUN nuclear watchdog\u0026#39s inspections chief quits after US withdrawal from Iran dealGeorge Osborne speaks of his delight after discovering he is JewishCalls for urgent investigation to explain 20,000 additional deathsScientists to develop Neanderthal \u0026#39miniature brains\u0026#39Bafta TV Awards 2018: Who will win, and who should win?Drones banned from Windsor during Royal wedding weekend due to privacy and security concernsTheresa May\u0026#39s desperate last roll of the dice to break customs union impasseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"barclays jes staley whistleblower identity fca bank latest","story":"Mr Staley tried to identify the author of an anonymous letter in 2016City regulators have handed Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, a £642,430 fine for his part in a whistleblowing scandal at the bank in 2016. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) said in April that it would fine the lender’s boss for breaching conduct rules when he tried to identify a whistleblower. On Friday, the watchdogs confirmed the amount and also said they had imposed special requirements regarding whistleblowing systems and controls at Barclays. Mr Staley tried to find out who wrote two anonymous letters, which were sent to the board and a senior executive in June 2016. The letters, considered to be whistleblowing, raised concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year.Mark Steward, FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: “Given the crucial role of the chief executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees.“Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays’ whistleblowing procedures. Chief executives must act with a high degree of care and prudence at all times. Mr Steward added: “Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the financial services sector. It is critical that iniduals are able to speak up anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.”The PRA’s chief executive Sam Woods said: “Protection for whistleblowers is an essential part of keeping the financial system safe and sound. Mr Staley’s behaviour fell below the standard we require, resulting in today’s fine and public censure. In addition, Barclays is now subject to special requirements to report to the PRA and FCA how it handles its whistleblowing cases in the coming years.”Barclays: Can whistleblowers be confident after FCA warns CEO Staley?Barclays boss Jes Staley to be fined over whistleblower scandalGovernment lambasted for trumpeting prosecution of whistleblowerNicky Morgan, MP, who chairs the Treasury committee, said the committee would ask the FCA why it believes the fines handed down were appropriate, and what the implications are for the senior managers regime - a set of rules introduced in 2016 aimed at increasing the personal accountability of senior staff in financial services firms. “As the FCA’s decision notice states, a CEO should set an example to the firm’s employees. Clearly Mr Staley has failed in this regard,” Ms Morgan added. The Barclays board said it had reduced the value of Mr Staley’s “variable compensation” - meaning his annual bonus - by £500,000 following the regulators’ decision. Mr Staley said: I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made.

The cost of the wedding itself – the food, the Ralph \u0026amp Russo Couture dress etc – will be picked by the Royal Family.But the security costs have been estimated at more than £20m. And that will be borne by the public purse.Yet the wedding might also attract additional tourists from abroad, whose expenditure will help defray some of those public costs.Some have even claimed that sales of memorabilia will boost the overall economy.Which leaves us with the perennial questions: How much money do we spend on the British monarchy? How much of an asset is it to the economy? Is the Royal Family really “worth it”?How much does the Royal Family cost the taxpayer?Direct funding to meet the monarchy’s official expenditure is now through something called the “Sovereign Grant”.This replaced the old Civil List and grants-in-aid from government departments in 2012 and is supposed to be reviewed every five years.In 2016-17 the Sovereign Grant was £42.8m, rising to £76m in 2017-18, with the increase difference earmarked for refurbishing Buckingham Palace.Royalists often point out that these costs represent only around £1 a year to every person in the UK.However, this does not include the security costs of looking after the family.One republican pressure group has estimated that these add up to £100m a year and help push the actual annual public cost of the monarchy closer to £350m.So the royals spend that money how they want?No, that’s the funding of their official duties – opening buildings, chairing charities, hosting garden parties, travelling the country and abroad etc.The Queen, Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family have private incomes too from their private landed estates and financial assets.A sum of money called “The Privy Purse” goes to the Queen as revenue from a landed estate called the Duchy of Lancaster. This was £19.1m in 2016-17.Do the royals pay tax?The Queen has voluntarily paid income and capital gains tax since 1992 on her private income and the revenues not used to finance her official work.Prince Charles has also voluntarily paid income tax on his income from another landed estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, since 1993.In 2016-17 that estate yielded him revenue of £22.5m, on which he paid tax of £4.76m.But the situation is complicated.The majority of Prince Charles’ official duties are financed from the Duchy’s income. This income also covers the costs of the official duties of Camilla, William and Kate and Harry.All this expenditure offsets Charles’ tax liability. And all the “working royals” in Charles’ direct family also get some revenues from the Sovereign Grant too.Meanwhile, some of the Queen’s Privy Purse is also used to fund her official duties, which means she doesn’t pay tax on that element of her income.And what financial benefits do the royals bring?VisitBritain reckons that tourism linked to royal residences such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle adds up to 2.7 million visitors a year.And a consultancy called Brand Finance estimated in 2017 that the monarchy’s annual contribution to the UK economy to be around £1.8bn a year, drawing in an additional £550m of tourism revenues a year, and an increase in trade, from the Royal Family acting as ambassadors, supposedly worth £150m a year.That might sound impressive – and it’s certainly more than the higher estimates of the Royal Family’s costs to the public purse – but it’s important to put those numbers in context.Overseas visitors are estimated to have spent £22.5bn in the UK in 2016. And total UK exports summed to £543bn. Viewed from that perspective, the additional royal-related revenues start to look somewhat trivial.Moreover, we should treat even estimates of economic activity linked to the royals with a large dash of scepticism.The only way to reach these numbers is to estimate the counterfactual – what would have happened to UK tourism or trade if the Royal Family didn’t exist? Or if the official Royal Family was significantly smaller and less expensive to run?That’s not easily done. Would foreigners really be less likely to visit the UK’s historic palaces if they were no longer lived in, from time to time, by the Queen, or Prince Charles? Would the monarchy be less of a tourist draw if the likes of lesser working royals such as Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent were no longer funded by the Sovereign Grant?The economic boost from visits and festivities related to royal celebrations should certainly be treated with caution given these can displace economic activity as well as create it.This seems to have happened around Prince William’s wedding in 2011, when many UK residents appear to have left the country. Royalists might make the historic argument that the monarchy brings political stability to the UK, which has a high value to the economy. But, again, this is difficult to put a price on. Especially when the appropriate counterfactual is not anarchy, but a stable republic like France or Germany.In the end, the question of whether the Royal Family is worth it, or not, is probably less a financial question than a political, moral and aesthetic one.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She has made some positive noises, and so far there has been restraint about appointing new peers.“But until there is a commitment to an overall cap on the size of the House there is a limit to what we can do.House of Lords votes out prospect of UK leaving EU with ‘no deal’“Once we have a number we can make real proactive efforts to persuade people they should go. There has been some proactive work going on, but we could write to all peers who do not attend often and suggest it is time for them to leave.”Decades of attempts to reform the Lords have failed for political reasons, with a clear chance missed in 2012 due to squabbling between Liberal Democrats and Tory MPs.May can reverse most of the Lords defeats – except on a customs unionLord speaker confirms Trump could speak in parliament despite banThe House of Lords helps to uphold our democracyLords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banMay vows to overturn Lords plan which could stop BrexitMay will take a risk if she overturns the Lords’ decision on BrexitAs a result, the Lord Speaker’s Committee spent a year to October 2017 forming a plan to at least reduce the chamber’s size without the need to pass new laws – the idea being it would be easier for any PM to push through.The committee published a 40-page report recommending slashing the number of peers to 600 in a decade, limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and a new “two out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in size.  But in February, Ms May said they needed “further careful thought” and instead highlighted her restraint in appointing new peers since arriving in Downing Street, though she also announced a handful of new Tory lords. Overall, numbers on Ms May’s watch have fallen from 812 to 792.At the time the PM’s response was welcomed as positive, but there are concerns in parliament that more needs to be done to drive the process forward.Lords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banA Downing Street source said the government is “working through” the reform plans. The Independent understands the focus will be on restraint in appointing new peers rather than a cap, however.Senior sources in the Lords also suggested that removing peers proportionately in order to maintain the overall political balance of the house could help persuade peers they would not be disadvantaging their party by leaving.Another idea to reduce members coming in could be to introduce a new kind of peerage that does not involve membership of the house.The source said: “Someone like Sir James Dyson could become Lord Dyson – but you don’t want him working in the Lords, you want him developing new technology and running business. That kind of peerage could have very wide appeal.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesJeremy Corbyn with shipbuilding apprentices at the Fairfield Ship Building Museum in Govan.

That is not what the public voted for.Tory MP Heidi Allen signalled her support for the Lords amendments - and warned that the Commons would reject any no deal scenario.The passage of the Great Repeal Bill was always going to be turbulent, but the Lords are merely reflecting what the majority of MPs believe - that Parliament must have a say in whether the deal is good enough, and no deal never will be, she said.Best for Britain, the pro-EU campaign, have dismissed Liam Fox\u0027s remarks earlier today about the House of Lords.\u0026nbspEloise Todd, the chief executive, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLiam Fox is throwing his toys out of the pram like a petulant child.

But Mr Mahathir said he had won a clear mandate to form a new government and brushed aside any doubts that he would be the one to take the country forward.There is an urgency here, we need to form the government now, today, Mr Mahathir told a news conference, where he insisted that he would be sworn in as prime minister later on Thursday.Malaysia opposition coalition leader Mahathir Mohamad: \u0027swearing in of Prime Minister will occur within a day\u0027An official from the opposition alliance, known as the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), said Mr Mahathir had been granted a meeting with the king at 5pm local time.Pakatan Harapan comfortably beat Mr Najib\u0027s Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition, and official results showed it took 113 seats - one more than the number required for a majority in the 222-member parliament.But doubts remained over Mr Mahathir\u0027s status, Malaysian media reported, as Pakatan Harapan was not formally registered as a coalition prior to the vote.Asked why he had not yet been sworn in on Thursday afternoon, Mr Mahathir said he got up late after the vote count went long into the night. Mr Mahathir led Malaysia for 22 years until 2003, but returned from political retirement to take charge of the opposition, with Mr Najib embroiled in a corruption scandal and facing growing unpopularity towards a controversial new sales tax.Looking downcast as he took to the stage to address the media alongside other senior National Front politicians, Mr Najib said: The National Front will respect whatever decision is made by the king.

There is no suggestion Oaksure have behaved in any improper way.In a statement to The Sun the government has denounced the schemes and revealed it will be issuing fresh advice on the practice.Labour MP Clive Betts, chair of Parliaments Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, said: When you are desperate for housing, like many are in London, people can easily walk into this and find they have no security or rights at all.”A source close to the company told how the industry boomed during the financial crash with unregulated firms seeing the schemes as a licence to print money.The insider added: Its unregulated so anyone can start a  business and draw up a licence agreement to occupy properties.“Askins was a rogue in that he had no intention of honouring the money he owed to people – suppliers, electricians, plumbers, they were small fry compared to s.“They all thought the deposits were safe but because it’s unregulated they were not protected and he spent s’ bond money basically.”But many renters have complained of leaking roofs, poor conditions and ruthless companies taking advantage of their financial plight.One told a reporter how rats had infested their property with water leaking in from the roof but that  firm had failed to tackle the issue.Councils across London and private landlords are allowing the companies to rent out an increasing number of empty buildings with up to 7,000 property s - almost double the figure of three years ago.We found companies currently advertising to live in derelict school buildings, youth centres and empty flats for up to £750-a-month with deposits as high as £900 and admin charges of more than £150.And with London rental prices having increased by more than 60 per cent in some areas over the last decade - meaning a similar one-bedroom space could be at least double  price - it is thought ship trend will continue to grow.But experts have warned s are vulnerable as they do not have adequate protections including for deposits which can be over £1,000 and average around £550, according to a recent report.Firms can install temporary showers and kitchens to re-classify buildings as domestic use - slashing business rates.But some s have told how companies do not provide heating - instead requiring renters to buy electric heaters and even fire safety equipment while still paying utility bills on top.And the cost of occupying abandoned buildings as s has risen sharply in the more than ten years the schemes have been operating.Renters used to pay a nominal fee of £100-200 per month to occupy a building and help secure it but now rents average just under £500 across London.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said they do not endorse property ship as people can be left to live in poor conditions and pledged to issue new advice.While Green Party councillor Sian Berry, chair of the London Assembly Housing Committee, said: Most property s are working people on lower than average wages, who don’t have any other housing alternatives.The contracts they sign up to can include clauses that deny them basic human rights, like the ability to speak out if they are treated badly.They are licensees, not tenants, so risk losing deposits when property  firms go bust, just as has happened on this occasion.Askins failed to respond to the Sun Online and is currently the director of the re-named firm New Century s with a postal address in Central London.Southwark Council, whose logo appears on the firms New Century s website, said they had cut all ties and were seeking to have their branding removed after being alerted by The Sun.A spokeswoman for Greenwich Council said they had no option but to write-off the £71,644 owed by Newbould when the company went into liquidation."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000394900236.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"global britain customs union sun says","story":"As MPs return to Parliament this week, Tory rebels think they can twist the Prime Minister’s arm and force her into membership of the customs union, or at least an imitation of it.They’re all over the airwaves slamming their free-trading colleagues as “hard Brexit” ideologues.But those pushing for us to strike out on our own are far from rabid extremists.

You still live in a country where crooked, self-serving politicians are scrutinised by journalists without state censorship.Ed Miliband’s “Leveson 2” inquiry would have been a pointless waste of public money motivated by sour grapes.A few Tories supported it out of naked self-interest. Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour. He finally bottled out of a vote he knew he would lose. A malevolent conspiracy theorist, bully and liar . . . now a coward to boot.But the Labour lardbucket ­will not give up. Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again. They can begin by repealing Section 40, as their manifesto pledged.THE Lords’ latest sickening insult to democracy has surely hammered the final nail in the unelected chamber’s coffin.Their vote to stay in the single market is beyond belief in its stupidity, arrogance and insane ­willingness to expose the country to dangerous instability.It would mean surrendering control over immigration for ever — and never actually “leaving” the EU.The Lords’ role is to tweak and advise on laws, not impose entirely contrary policies because they don’t like how the country votes. They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

survived four powerful earthquakes, two world wars and visits from millions of people annually – but how does it remain upright?Now, 500 years on, it seems that a team of engineers have finally cracked this age-old mystery.The gravity-defying structure is around 184 feet tall and leans at a dramatic 5 degree angle thanks to a patch of soft ground to one side that caused its foundations to slip.A research team made up of 18 engineers claim that its survival is due to a phenomenon called “dynamic soil-structure interaction.”This basically means that the soft soil surrounding the tower’s foundations absorb the vibrations better than a harder soil would, thus preventing damaging vibrations making their way up the structure.University of Bristol engineer George Mylonakis explains: “Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the tower to the verge of collapse can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events.”Italys most beloved architectural accident is actually a freestanding bell tower, located behind the Pisa Cathedral and took two centuries to build.Construction of the campanile began in August 1173.By 1178, workers had made it to the third storey of the structure, which was already tilting slightly to the north.Military conflicts with other Italian states halted progress on the tower, and construction did not resume again until 1272.Twelve years in, and another war stopped the work.A final wave of construction picked up again in the early 14th century, concluding with the installation of a bell chamber in 1372."},{"url":null,"title":"kanye west 2xu sportswear launch stopped bike shorts","story":"Products up for sale included £270 bike shorts and £300 neoprene leggings - with the brand warning: Fans

family emerging from their car yards from a group of several cheetahs.A man opens one of the front doors and starts taking pictures.One of the back doors then opens and a woman climbs out before making her way around to put two items in the boot.The bystanders in the second car can be heard exclaiming in shock – before two kids then also jump out to stand beside her as the predators start to take notice.Later on in the footage the family – reportedly from France – climb out of their vehicle again slightly further away.But this time the cheetahs suddenly jump up and start bounding towards them.The family run back towards their car as the animals begin to surround them to go in for the kill – making it to safety just in time.The shocking incident was confirmed by park manager Niels de Wildt, who said the family had been “incredibly lucky”.He told Dutch radio station NOS: The cheetahs are on a food schedule so they are not extremely hungry and are not in the hunt.In the first instance they have the same reaction as when someone rings in unexpectedly, they think, ‘Hey, something strange is happening in our territory’.But in the end they do respond to this exceptional visit

week it was revealed the US actress will have her reclusive father Thomas Markle Snr by her side when she gets married, while her mother Doria Ragland is also expected to be at St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle.In a statement released by the palace last week, more details of the guests were revealed.It was confirmed newborn Prince Louis not among them, but with his siblings Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, two, expected to be there.The palace said that Prince Philip was hoped to be among the guests as he continues to recover from his a hip operation.Last month he underwent a hip replacement after suffering from pain for weeks.He missed a number of family events as he recuperated, including the Easter church service.A Palace statement at the time read: “The Duke of Edinburgh has undergone a successful hip replacement operation.He is progressing satisfactorily at this early stage. His Royal Highness is likely to remain in hospital for several days. He is comfortable and in good spirits.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405200566.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cotton bud removed ear years after stuck","story":"The man went to a clinic in Leicestershire complaining of pain and limited hearing in his right ear.He told doctors at the Hear Clinic he had got a cotton bud stuck in his ear two years ago but he believed it had fallen out on its own.But, after recently going swimming, the water that entered the man’s ear caused the cotton bud to swell and cause him pain.The wad of cotton was removed by Neel Raithatha at the clinic on June 6Neel said: “The client reported muffled hearing in the right ear.“Fortunately, the eardrum was healthy and intact and it took around a minute to remove.“It was a delicate procedure given the cotton bud was pushed right up against the eardrum.“I had to ensure I did not exert any force whilst removing as I could have easily have perforated the eardrum in doing so.”Experts have previously warned against using cotton buds to clean your ears.Inserting cotton buds in your ear could push wax even further into the ear canal and even damage your eardrum, according to draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).Instead, they suggest ear irrigation should be used to help those who are experiencing hearing problems due to wax build-up.This involves an electronic machine safely pumping water into the ear to remove wax under the guidance of a GP.This mans case is not the first time Neel, who calls himself the wax whisperer, has had to remove an unusual object from a patient’s ear.“I have previously removed a pen cap and earring from the ear,” he added.Earwax, also called cerumen, is a naturally occurring substance that protects the skin of the ear canal, helps keep it clean and protects against bacteria.It can build-up over time but usually excess earwax falls out on its own.But if it doesnt, you should visit your GP or pharmacist."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004030209981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk faces weekend weather

to pack an umbrella on their weekend adventures.Although some parts of the country will see some sunshine for brief moments, the temperatures have dropped.Wind and rain is expected to sweep through western parts of the country today, and heavy rain is predicted to move across central and northern areas before hitting the southwest.A Met Office spokesman said: Through Saturday it will be a bit of a mixed bag across the whole of the UK.There is the chance that there will be rain across the whole of the UK in the afternoon.Elsewhere mainly dry and bright in central and northern parts of Britain staying brighter.Down in southwestern England maybe some parts of Wales and Northern Ireland its going to be a bit of a mixture of showers.For Sunday theres still some rain around in the East so it could be that right across that eastern side of Britain and Scotland.We might see a cloudy sky and some rain there.Although Wales looks to be a bit brighter we might see the odd shower popping up in places like northern England and Ireland.Temperatures look to be around average for the time of year, which is 14/15C.The beginning of next week is expected to remain cool, with showers and longer spells of rain.The east and the south will be hit the worst with the downpours, but from Tuesday conditions should settle and leave conditions drier and slightly warmer.The Met Office added: Next week looks as to the end of the week we might start to see high pressure building and that means that we are going to have some more dry conditions next week.There will be bands of rain around, its just

lives vomiting gastroenteritis","story":"A clinical trial found the root can reduce the severity and frequency of vomiting in children with gastroenteritis.Children aged between one and 10 vomited 20 per cent less when given ginger, compared to a placebo treatment.And those taking sick days from school was 28 per cent lower in kids given the spice.Dr Roberto Berni Canani, associate professor of paediatrics from the University of Napoli in Italy said the research could potentially save lives worldwide.Acute gastroenteritis is still one of the biggest causes of death in children living in developing countries, he told the The Independent.And dehydration is its most dangerous complication.Reducing the amount a person vomits when they are unwell can prevent dehydration.We anticipate that the results will have a great impact on future clinical practice and the advice given to parents in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis and could potentially save lives across Europe and the globe, Dr Canani added.In the clinical trial 140 children were given ginger or a placebo.Ginger has long been used as a natural remedy for stomach upset.Studies have found the spice has anti-inflammatory properties, which can also be used to help ease swelling in the body.Gastroenteritis is a very common condition that causes diarrhoea and vomiting.Its usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug.The illness affects people of all ages but is most common in children.Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week.You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until youre feeling better.Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, take painkillers for aches and pains and get plenty of rest to beat the bug.If the illness has not cleared up within a week, or you experience symptoms of dehydration, notice blood in your poo or cant keep any fluids down you should speak to a GP.Dr Canani and his team plan to look at whether ginger can be effective in children without gastroenteritis to prevent unnecessary GP visits.The findings were presented at the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutritio."},{"url":null,"title":"school bans pencil cases to stop poor pupils being bullied for not having them","story":"St Wilfrid’s Primary in Blyth, Northumberland now provides its students with

“designer goods”, which has seen a standard backpack introduced, The BBC reports.The number of dress-up and fundraising days have also been cut back.The moves come after the school took part in a project with charity Children North East to stop poorer pupils being stigmatised.Pauline added: There was a culture within the school, within pupils, that noticed those children who were never in on PE days for example.Part of our uniform policy is a standard backpack so we dont have any designer goods.The project, which over 100 schools took part in, has led to higher attendance and better results.Behaviour has reportedly improved and more pupils are taking part in extracurricular activities.Burnside College in Wallsend, North Tyneside also took part in it.Pupil Harris Auchterlonie, 15, said: There was a real big issue with some people, it really got to them. There was a really big social expectation to have the best things and it was affecting school life for a lot of people.There was groups created around who had the best things but I think that has been taken away.

The Communist party is hopelessly out of date’.“Well, where are we now?”Mr Griffiths also pointed out that there were “no major differences on immediate issues” between Labour and the Communist Party of Britain.There are close links between the two, given that Andrew Murray, one of Mr Corbyn’s key advisers, was until recently a Communist party member.Seumas Milne, Mr Corbyn’s communications director, is also close to the party, and the leader himself spent years writing columns in the Morning Star, the Socialist daily newspaper with close links to British communists.And last year the Communist Party did not field any candidates in the general election for the first time since its formation - instead urging followers to back Mr Corbyns Labour.The glowing endorsement will cause further disquiet among Labour moderates, but Mr Griffiths insisted that Mr Corbyn was “very much his own person”.But in response to the comments a Labour party spokesperson said: Labour stands unequivocally for the policies laid out in our manifesto, which were supported by nearly 13 million people - 40 per cent of voters - in last year’s general election.It comes after Mr Corbyn came under fire for holding a meeting with the far-left political party which is the successor to Germanys hated Communists.The Labour boss held talks with Katja Kipping of Die Linke, who has previously called for the complete overthrow of capitalism, and is in direct competition with the SPD, Labours sister party in GermanyHer party, the fifth largest in her country, was born out of the Soviet-backed Communists who ruled over East Germany for decades.One furious Labour MP told The Sun, They were the guys who built the Berlin Wall!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s so many questions I don’t know the answer to about why we never went on a second date.“But I’m blaming it on the garlic noodles.To this day that’s like an ongoing joke — don’t order the ­garlic noodles that ruined my ­chances!”He made up for it by going on to bed socialite Paris Hilton, whose One Night In Paris sex tape was leaked online.Paris and Simon had an intense three-month relationship and saw each other on and off for four years. Their wild nights together were a world away from Simon’s date with “square” Meghan.Simon Rex, as rapper Dirt, says dates with Paris were a world away from square MeghanIn an exclusive chat from his home in LA, Simon, 43, said: “Meghan seemed well-raised and ­educated, she wasn’t a bad girl. She was kind of a square.“That’s probably why we didn’t hit it off, I’m a little more rough around the edges. When I asked her out again I just got the hint she wasn’t into me. I took it on the chin.”Meghan and Simon met in 2004 when they guest starred on Cuts, a long-forgotten US ­sitcom.Simon’s career was flying high after a role on hit comedy Scary Movie 3.He said: “Maybe that’s why she liked me — I remember her saying she thought it was really funny. It probably helps when you’re on the poster for a big movie and in all the commercials.”They were together for four days of rehearsals before shooting scenes in front of a live studio ­audience on a Friday night at Paramount studios in Hollywood.He said: “We were both new to the show and we were both nervous. You get to know someone pretty quick when you’re sitting round together all day on set.“She was sweet and very polite. She had kind eyes. You could tell she was a nice person.“She would laugh at my corny jokes. I remember flirting with her, cracking jokes and her laughing. My ego loved that, of course.“I don’t believe in love at first sight but I believe in lust at first sight and she was really attractive. She’s a beautiful girl.”By the last day of filming Simon decided he wanted a date and plucked up the courage to ask Meghan out.He said: “I worked up enough nerve to give her my number.“This is pre-smartphones and social media. It might be one of the last times I wrote my number on a napkin.”Meghan quickly got in touch and he asked her out for dinner.The pair went to the Woo Lae Oak, a Korean barbecue restaurant in Beverly Hills. Simon had chopsticks with his name on brought out because he was such a regular there. He ordered a beef dish and another of chicken.He said: “We had a great time. she wouldn’t drink, I had wine but she had water or Coke.“A lot of actresses tend to be divas but she was the opposite. She was sweet to the waiter.“She looked really beautiful. I was like, sign me up, man!”But one of the other dishes Simon ordered was garlic noodles — which proved to be a mistake after he drove her home.He recalls: “We were in the car and as I started kissing her it was obvious that I had garlic breath.“She pulled back. It was so embarrassing.“She said something like, ‘Oh boy, garlic’.“I just felt so dumb. We laughed about it. She wasn’t rude about it or anything. She was honest. She was turned off. It was an awkward moment.”Simon asked Meghan to go to a bar or a club with him after their meal but she declined.He said: “I remember her saying something like, ‘I’ve got to get up early’. She had to work the next day or something.”At the end of their date, crestfallen Simon jumped out of his black Cadillac and opened the door for Meghan to let her out.He hugged her and she went into her home.Simon texted Meghan a couple of days later but admits: “I didn’t get a second date.“I think she even said something along the lines of, ‘We could just be friends’, which was like a dagger to the heart.Meghan — who The Sun revealed used dating guide The Rules to fix her love life — stuck to one of the book’s principles with Simon — “no more than casual kissing on the first date”.Simon said with a laugh: “Looks like she stuck to her rule book. This is all news to me!”The Sun’s revelations about porn star Simon’s past date with Meghan have caused a sensation — just a week before she is due to marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle.A decade before their date Simon had performed a sex act on himself for a porn movie at age 18 after being persuaded to do it by an adult film actress he was dating.To pay his rent, he starred as mystery hunk “Sebastian” in three solo nude sex films which went straight to video. He said: “I never had sex with anybody on camera. It was just me standing there naked.“To me it doesn’t mean s*** but I could see why some people get their feathers ruffled about it, especially the Royal Family.”Simon has had a string of stunning exes including Jaime Pressly from TV’s My Name Is Earl and Twin Peaks’ actress Lara Flynn Boyle.He is also pals with Brit celebrities Calum Best and super producer Mark Ronson. It wasn’t long after his date with Meghan that he started seeing heiress Paris.The blonde reality TV star had shot to fame after footage of her having sex with US poker player Rick Salomon was leaked on the internet. Simon said: “I did a movie, Pledge This with Paris.“Me and Paris were casually dating but it was not like I couldn’t take a girl out on a date, we weren’t exclusive.“This was when she was at the top of her fame. It was like Kim Kardashian. You couldn’t just go to get a drink or dinner because she was swarmed.“It was non-stop. I don’t know how she does it.“It was out of control with Paris, totally exhausting.“It is ironic, as that’s now Meghan Markle’s world.”The comic and rapper — whose hip-hop alter-ego is Dirt Nasty — said he believes he would get on with Prince Harry and was impressed by his naked antics in Las Vegas.He said: “I like the dude — he’s the one royal I like. I swear me and him, under different circumstances, would have a beer and a laugh. I really think that.“You can tell Harry has a sense of humour. He might even be a Dirt Nasty fan, I know he’s in to hip-hop.”Speaking of the upcoming wedding, Simon, who is now in a new relationship, added: “I’ve got nothing but love for both of them.“She made the better move to go with him in the long run. I think she’ll be a great princess.“I hope they have a lot of babies and make America proud. Good on them.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

one of which is given some money.But while the person with the cash is obligated to share some of the loot with other player that portion can be as small as zero.And the Dutch scientists found that small men act more aggressively when there is no threat of repercussions, reports The New Scientist.Experts believe this proves that short man syndrome, also known as Napoleon Complex, is real and factors into the everyday lives of vertically-challenged males.In the study, the 42 volunteers were split into pairs and allowed to meet their partners – who were either little or large depending on their own stature.After allowing the tiny test subjects to see their physically dominant opponents, each player was given a separate room where they were asked to give up some cash.The shortest men in the study, measuring around 5ft7in kept 14 of their 18 tokens to themselves on average while the tall men, measuring about 6ft6in in height, only kept nine of their 18 credits.But when the small gents were faced with the threat of repercussion, they did not display aggressive behaviour and were more willing to share with their opponents.Lead researcher Jill Knapen said: “It’s probably smart for short men to be like this because they have less opportunities to get resources.Short blokes on average are less wealthy, less successful and less healthy than their taller counterparts, according to studies.Bigger men also enjoy better sex and love lives than small guys.Little men may also have to adopt a more defensive stance because of aggression from their larger peers.Mike Eslea at the University of Central Lancashire is sceptical about whether the type of behaviour displayed by small males can be explained by the Napoleon Complex.Speaking to New Scientist, he said: “They’re supposed to be publicly advertising their aggressiveness to compensate for their lack of stature.“To me this doesn’t suggest the Napoleon Complex exactly, it suggests something else.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405240436.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"newlywed couple china honeymoon preston","story":"Legend Liang, 33 and his new wife Carmen, travelled 6,000 miles to spend their holiday not on a sandy beach under a palm tree but in the Lancashire city.He whisked Carmen from their home and spent three days in the town -

which is the tallest in Britain.But Legend was amazed at the difference a decade made - with the campus now including its Xbox building - a green, grey and black-coloured media centre.He added: The Media Factory was a building site so its nice to see that looking so good, Fylde Building has gone and theres others being built while in the city centre the market has changed so much.The pair spent the last two weeks also visiting London, Brighton and Edinburgh as they flew back home to their native China on Thursday.Legend, a Guangzhou Yangcheng Evening News reporter, said his wife had enjoyed her trip to Preston as much as him - proving the 14 hour flight was worth it.He said: She thought London was a huge city, just like we have back home but Preston was really nice because she could see how UK people live and work in a small city with everything they need being close by.Legend studied at Guangdong University of Foreign Study, an international partner of UCLan since 1986, for two years before his move to Preston.He was taught in his home country by Matt Horn - the course leader of the international journalism franchise programme since it began in 2005.Matt said: Legend always showed the natural instincts required of a good journalist and is well respected in the city.UCLan and GDUFS have a long and happy history together and so I was delighted when Legend introduced his bride to be as I had taught her for GDUFS a couple of years after I was Legends teacher.Preston is famous as the location for the opening of the first KFC in the UK in 1965 and as the home of Preston North End FC."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-richard-ned-lebow-professor_4306913.jpg?20180511155257 ","title":"academic refuses to apologise for lame lingerie joke","story":"She told Sky News: \"A comment about \u0027ladies lingerie\u0027 in a public setting, at an academic conference, is both unprofessional and inappropriate because of its sexual innuendo.\"Those who suggest that I should have approached Professor Lebow instead of filing an official complaint overlook the broader context of the incident as well as systemic sexism that women in the academy... have dealt with for decades.\"British media reports have suggested Mr Lebow was riffing the joke from the then-popular 1970s and 1980s British show Are You Being Served?, an innuendo heavy comedy set in a department store.Ms Sharoni says: \"The issue is not the intent of the comment nor the content or historical/cultural context of the \u0027joke\u0027."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-queen-philip_4306605.jpg?20180511114551 ","title":"duke of edinburgh appears ready for royal wedding after hip surgery","story":"At the time, it was said that hip replacement patients have to walk aided for the first four to six weeks after surgery, meaning the Duke could be using a walking stick at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding on 19 May at Windsor.Palace officials have previously said he will attend the wedding if he is well enough.:: Prince Philip -

along with specialists from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Medecins Sans Frontier (MSF) will have to act aggressively to check its advance, with officials telling Sky News they are now \"urgently assessing the situation\".And there are several reasons to be seriously concerned.For starters, a WHO official revealed that several cases of Ebola were first documented back in December - meaning that the virus has already had five months to spread.When a person contracts the ebola, they generally exhibit symptoms like fever, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting (including bright red blood) and internal haemorrhaging.It is spread through bodily fluids and extremely contagious - and the Zaire species (first detected on the Ebola River in the DRC) results in death in 60 to 90% of cases.There is no cure for it - although scientists are making progress with treatments using antibodies sourced from horses and mice.Thirdly, health professionals will be mindful of recent experience. The world\u0026#8217s worst Ebola outbreak took the lives of 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in 2014 after the virus spread from a young boy living in a village in rural Guinea. Poorly equipped and understaffed medical workers turned down infected patients and when the disease spread to the densely populated Liberian capital of Monrovia a health crisis turned into a catastrophe.In early 2016, the WHO said the outbreak had been contained and eliminated but 17,000 survivors were left traumatised and fearful of the future.Over the past few days, the DRC\u0026#8217s near-neighbours like Nigeria have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus by introducing checks and health screening at its airports.Meanwhile, the Trump administration signalled its disinterest when it asked for ebola-related funding cuts of US$252 million, as part of a package aimed at reigning in government spending."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-mark-carney-bank-of-england_4305863.jpg?20180510163407 ","title":"why is theresa may so enthusiastic about grammar schools","story":"It happened, of course, when Margaret Thatcher was education secretary.Yes, the same Margaret Thatcher who closed more grammar schools - as opponents love to point out - than any other minister, Labour or Conservative.In fact, supporters of grammar schools like to blame Harold Wilson\u0027s Labour governments of the 1960s for introducing comprehensive schools.But the first comprehensives were actually opened by the Conservative governments of the 1950s and early 1960s.Since succeeding Old Etonian David Cameron - who was no fan of grammar schools - as Prime Minister, Mrs May has been determined to revive them.At first, she wanted more of them, promising a \"new generation\" of grammar schools \"a grammar school in every town\", it was suggested.There are currently 163 of them, many of them in Tory-controlled counties like Buckinghamshire and Kent. In Labour strongholds, you\u0027d be hard pressed to find any.But after the PM lost her Commons majority in last year\u0027s general election, she doesn\u0027t have the votes in the Commons for a widespread expansion of the grammar school system.So she\u0027s now attempting to boost the ones that are there already, with a \u0026#16350m fund to create thousands of extra places, many for pupils from poorer backgrounds.She has found a willing accomplice in Damian Hinds, a grammar school boy from Altrincham in Manchester\u0027s leafier suburbs, who was promoted to Education Secretary in the January reshuffle.His two predecessors in the job, Justine Greening and Nicky Morgan, both of whom were sacked by Mrs May, didn\u0027t care for grammar schools at all.Ms Greening, who last week urged employers to discriminate against applicants from Eton, is a steelworker\u0027s daughter from Rotherham who went to the town\u0027s Oakwood Comprehensive School.As the Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran put it, rather colourfully: \"We now know what we suspected. Justine Greening was moved on to make way for a lap dog for Theresa May\u0027s pet projects.\"So why the PM\u0027s enthusiasm for grammars? She and other supporters claim they\u0027re good for social mobility. Opponents say they do the exact opposite.After all, a grammar school in every town suggests a secondary modern in every town too. But you won\u0027t find many Tory MPs who support grammar schools backing a return of secondary moderns for children who fail the 11-plus.Ah yes, Tory MPs! Looking at the politics of all this, surely a big motive for the PM in the Government\u0027s \u0026#16350m handout to grammar schools is pleasing Conservative backbenchers. or at least those on the Tory Right.That\u0027s because Conservative MPs who love grammar schools are largely the same ones who hate the European Union.They\u0027re also the same MPs who are currently holding the PM to ransom on Brexit and threatening to topple her if she caves in to Remainers. So cynics will regard the latest boost for grammar schools as a sop to the Tory Right, a bone tossed in their direction in the increasingly bitter Brexit dogfight - even if the Prime Minister does indeed appear to have an obsession with grammar schools.According to political journalist Rosa Prince\u0027s biography of Theresa May, The Enigmatic Prime Minister, it was at school that she became interested in politics.By the time she was in the sixth form she was apparently confident enough to announce that she intended to become Britain\u0027s first woman Prime Minister."},{"url":null,"title":"more half britains richest hedge","story":"NewsMore than half of Britain\u0027s richest hedge fund managers have donated to the ToriesCity financiers who have given a combined £15.6million to the Conservatives named among 21 wealthiest fund managers in latest Sunday Times Rich List\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business17:50, 11 MAY 2018Updated20:21, 11 MAY 2018NewsTheresa May\u0027s Conservative Party has received big donations from hedge fund bosses over the years (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwelve of Britain’s 21 richest hedge fund fat cats are Tory donors.

For example, Ski loving Alan Howard, who co-founded Brevan Howard, saw his estimated worth drop by \u0026pound30million to just over \u0026pound1billion. Meanwhile, David Harding, who set-up Mayfair-based Winton Capital, is \u0026pound300million worse off, according to research. Mr Harding, who is still worth \u0026pound1billion, has given the Tories \u0026pound873,000, according to the Electoral Commission\u0027s database. Its records show 12 of the 21 fund high flyers in this year\u0027s Sunday Times listing have over time given \u0026pound15.6million between them in cash or donations to the Tory party or, in some cases, individual Conservative MPs.

It came after Grenfell families blasted the Prime Minister in Parliament after she failed to resolve the key split over the public inquiry. Grieving relatives claimed the Prime Minister worsened their pain and suffering after a private meeting about the fire that killed 71 people last June. In a letter to chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick, Mrs May said she would add two additional members to the panel to ensure the panel has “the necessary breadth of skills and diversity of expertise”. She wrote: I hope this decision will provide reassurance to victims and survivors of the fire, the local community and members of Grenfell United, who have been clear with me and the Minister for Grenfell Victims, Nick Hurd, that you are the right person to lead this Inquiry but who also believe that, in Phase 2, it would be beneficial to have additional panel members recognising the scale and breadth of issues to be considered. The new members will sit alongside Sir Martin for phase two of the inquiry. Adel Chaoui, who lost four relatives in the fire is a member of Grenfell United and led a 150,000 signature petition for the group, along with Karim Mussilhy who lost his uncle and Sandra Ruiz who lost her niece.  Speaking on behalf of Grenfell United Adel said: “We should not have had to campaign for it, but relieved to finally have granted a panel for the Inquiry. This is a huge step for all of us who are desperate to make sure the Inquiry delivers truth and justice for the loved ones we lost in the fire \u0026amp those that survived. In the letter, Mrs May wrote: For my part, you will recall that I wrote to you on 21 December 2017 confirming that I did not consider it necessary to appoint additional panel members to the Inquiry panel at that time.  You are also aware that the Inquiries Act 2005 affords me the power to appoint panel members at any time during the Inquiry and I have iterated my intention to keep the matter under review. “To ensure the inquiry panel itself also has the necessary breadth of skills and diversity of expertise relevant to the broad range of issues to be considered in Phase 2, and to best serve the increasing scale and complexity of the work going forwards, I have decided to appoint an additional two panel members to support your chairmanship for Phase 2 of the Inquiry’s work. Sir Martin replied to the Prime Minister\u0027s letter, saying he looked forward to receiving the names of the people Mrs May decided to appoint to the panel. Tottenham MP David Lammy said:One step closer to justice. Testament to the courage, strength and dignity of the Grenfell families, survivors and wider community.  I’m proud to stand with you. This campaign should not have been needed but it was But Mrs May risked sparking fresh anger by refusing to change the first stage of the inquiry. The new panel members will not be added to the inquiry for Phase 1 - which includes examining the existing fire safety measures at Grenfell Tower. They will only be added for Phase 2, which will look at the wider responsibilities of authorities like Kensington and Chelsea Council. By that time, the date of which is yet to be agreed, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick will have already written an interim report on the disaster. Phase 1 opens on June 4 after commemorative hearings for the victims. Apart from looking at Grenfell’s existing fire safety, Phase 1 will mainly deal with the chain of events on the fatal night last year. Phase 2 will then examine a long list of remaining issues such as communication with residents, governance and management, inspections and previous inquiries. Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed a painting of the tower after the fire, featuring the inscription Eyesore!! Final Straw, will be displayed in Number 10. The painting is by Damel Carayol, a 55 year old artist from North London who lost family members in the disaster. The spokesman said: “She was given the painting yesterday. This will be coming to Downing Street. In the normal way when we receive artwork we will consider where it best fits.” “My understanding is there’s a process when we get artwork and we need to consider where it fits within the house. There’s a great deal of artwork in No10.” But asked specifically if it would be displayed in Number 10, he said: “Yes, that’s my understanding.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brits want amazing royal roadster","story":"NewsBrits want this amazing ‘Royal Roadster’ hybrid for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s to drive off in after weddingThe imaginary cool white sports car merges the best of British and American motoring – an Aston Martin DB11 and the iconic Ford Mustang\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAstrid Hall16:13, 11 MAY 2018Updated16:15, 11 MAY 2018NewsThe car’s name, Royal Roadster, was a clear winner, with almost 60 per cent of the vote, beating off other potential suggestions including the ‘Monarch’s Motor’ and ‘Prince’s Pit Stop’\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits believe this should be the vehicle newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will drive off into the sunset in following their wedding. The imaginary cool white sports car - dubbed the \u0027Royal Roadster\u0027 - merges the best of British and American motoring – an Aston Martin DB11 and the iconic Ford Mustang. And it topped a survey of more than 2,000 adults to uncover the top choices for the wedding vehicle. It is also thought the motor will feature neutral ribbons and elegant white flowers for a simple and classy look.  The research, commissioned by webuyanycar , revealed 86 per cent of Brits believe Harry and Meghan will hop into a British car on their big day, while one in 10 imagine the motor could be a half and half American-British hybrid.  The DB11 shape forms the base of webuyanycar’s imaginary Windsor wedding car, adapted with the wheels and arches of the iconic Mustang. The eye-catching car also sports the rear end of a classic Mustang, with a Ford bumper, chrome protection bar and two side exhausts.  The final design also reflects some more distinctive details – since four in 10 of those surveyed think the happy couple’s car will feature a personalised number plate. One in 10 even hope the royal wedding coup\u0026eacute will include a special side car for Meghan’s beloved pet Beagle, Guy.  Richard Evans, head of technical services at webuyanycar , said: “Everything about Harry and Meghan’s wedding, from the bridesmaids and cake, to the invitation and entertainment, has been speculated on by the public.  “Of course, travelling in style is a key part of a wedding day, so we decided to find out what the public thought the royals would choose for their wedding car.  “The fact that Harry and Meghan are a modern couple, with classic style, has been reflected in our unique design, which has been crowned the ‘Royal Roadster’. “We do live by our name of buying any car on the market and we purchase a fine selection of wedding cars and stretch limos every year. “I doubt we will ever see one as unique as the Royal Roadster, however. “Now we just can’t wait to see how close we got to the actual car the couple choose for their big day next week.” The car’s name, Royal Roadster, was a clear winner, with almost 60 per cent of the vote, beating off other potential suggestions including the ‘Monarch’s Motor’ and ‘Prince’s Pit Stop’.  One in twenty of those polled think the car will be decorated in celebration of the two nations, donning star-spangled banners and union jacks. And after tying the knot at Windsor Castle, 80 per cent of people said Harry would be the one to open the car door for Meghan like a true gent. In true royal fashion, three in five think the car will be driven by a member of the Royal Household Staff. But nearly one quarter believe all tradition will go out the window with Prince Harry sitting behind the wheel on his big day. Following their reception, many think the couple will head back to Buckingham Palace to greet their adoring fans. And one in 10 toyed with the notion that the newlyweds will head up to Balmoral to enjoy married life away from the public eye.  During their journey to their next destination as husband and wife, half agreed ‘Perfect’ by Ed Sheeran is the top choice of song to play in the wedding car. While 14 per cent named ‘Endless Love’ by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross as the driving theme tune Harry and Meghan will choose to start their new lives together. Nearly a third of people believe the couple will stash USB chargers in their wedding car to charge their phones so they can catch up on congratulatory texts after the drive. While nearly one quarter are in high hopes that the royal love birds will have a selfie stick on board to take snaps of their big day. The research also found that 63 per cent will be tuning into the big day.

She said there was one other passenger, a man, on the top deck of the bus when it happened, but he did not intervene. Karlah said she went downstairs and reported what had happened to the bus driver - but was stunned by his reaction.  He told me to sit downstairs, he didn\u0027t take down any details, she said. He just asked if it was the man in the red tracksuit. Karlah got off the bus two stops later, and said the man was still on the bus after her exit. He could have carried on doing it after I went, she said. The victim posted the video on Twitter, and was contacted by West Yorkshire Police, who asked her to give a statement about what happened. Officers are now investigating, but no arrests have been made.

Dr Bhushan said: “I knew that this baby was extremely fragile. That the baby had significant bruising and that the neck was stretched. I told others to be careful.” Yesterday the tribunal heard the baby died after the botched delivery caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb. A C-section was then carried out on the first-time mother to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was re-attached to his body so she could hold him before she said goodbye. It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.

And while Ms King may have a name \u0026shyworthy of royalty, that’s not her only \u0026shyconnection to the Duchess-in-waiting. Like the Suits star, Vicki is also 36 and, following a whirlwind romance with her own Prince Charming, is also set to tie the knot this summer. Now, after shedding 3st 3lb and four dress sizes, dark-haired Vicki has more than a sprinkle of Ms Markle’s sparkle. Still in shock at her fairy-tale \u0026shytransformation, Vicki, who has adopted Meghan’s style for our photo shoot, says: “I really can’t wait for my own wedding now. Watching the royal wedding will really get me excited, although no doubt they will have had a much bigger budget than us!” Vicki has gone from 12st 7lb to 9st 4lb and a dress size 16 to size eight, which means she now needs to have her wedding dress taken in.  “I bought it when I had only lost a stone,” she laughs. “Now it needs taking in and a huge chunk taken out of it. It feels fantastic as I’m so much happier and more relaxed. And now I picture myself in the dress and I know I will feel like a princess.” Administration officer Vicki had spent years lacking the confidence to dream of walking down the aisle – after trying to lose weight seven years ago. She had given up smoking at the age of 29 and had really seen the weight pile on as a result. A break-up led to a crash diet that helped her initially lose two stone but when Vicki met now-fiance Ross Miller, 39, on a dating website in 2014, she fell into a familiar trap... ending up putting even more weight back on. At 5ft 3in, she was 12st 7lb and a size 16. It wasn’t just that she felt unhappy in her clothes, it was knocking her confidence and increasing her anxiety. She says: “I lost weight too quickly after a stressful split and then, over time, I met Ross. As you do when you start dating, we were going drinking a lot and eating out.  “I found that I started to get really stressed and unhappy at work and, as the weight piled on, anxiety kicked in.  “Putting on weight was a mental and physical strain because I had no \u0026shyconfidence. I said to Ross, ‘I need to  do something, no one else is going to do  it for me’.”  The moment Vicki realised she really needed help was one day in June 2016, when she burst into tears after seeing herself in the mirror.  This time, Vicki, of Brighton, East Sussex, knew she had to lose the weight properly if she was going to keep it off. Having struggled with previous diets, she decided to go to a local Slimming World group after it was suggested by a colleague. And she was pleased to see losing the pounds didn’t mean going hungry. “Straight away, I couldn’t believe how much you can eat and what you can eat compared to what I was eating,” she says. “I’m a foodie and I wanted a plan where I could eat what I wanted – and I do. “When I was overweight, I never ate breakfast. I barely ate before lunchtime but I was eating all the wrong foods and too much food at the wrong times. Now I eat all day but it’s the right things.”  Vicki admits that before she started the diet she’d go for easy foods like a burger and chips or fried chicken, often washed down with half a bottle of wine. She also used to have an addiction to crisps, so decided she needed to completely cut them out. “I look back and think, ‘Oh my God, how did I eat that?’ I was eating crisps all the time. Now I just don’t buy them because I know I’ll eat them all and feel rubbish. It’s not worth it.” Instead, Vicki grazes on fruit and vegetables, has a healthy veggie lunch and still has a satisfying dinner such as homemade pasta, homemade chicken curry or a healthy roast. She is often eating more food than she did so previously.  “I have bigger portions than Ross! It’s all about loading up on lots of \u0026shyvegetables rather than just having the pasta,” she explains. “Sometimes I cut the pasta out completely.” And she hasn’t had to cut back on going out either. She still loves trips to Nando’s but will just choose skinless chicken options instead. Alongside her new food plan, Vicki took up running and signed up to her first half-marathon earlier this year but had to pull out due to injury. Just the thought of taking on such a challenge marks a massive change.  “When I was overweight, I really wanted to go to the gym but didn’t feel comfortable or confident,” she says. “So Ross got us an exercise bike and I started going on it three to four times a week for half an hour – it was great because no one could watch me. Then, in April last year, Ross and I signed up to the gym together. I started running four to five times a week.” Vicki found time for exercise by running to appointments instead of driving, and going to the gym early. “All I used to do was go to work, get home, sit down, eat and sleep,” she admits. “Now after work I will go to the gym or for a swim. It’s all about learning to make the time you have worthwhile.” But the biggest change was not just being able to buy a smaller dress size, she had won back her \u0026shyconfidence. She said goodbye to her anxiety and was back to being the warm, engaging person operations manager Ross had fallen for. Vicki even believes this new-found confidence is what inspired Ross to pop the question, six weeks after she started Slimming World.  “I remember how quickly I started to feel better about myself,” she says. “Every week I could see the numbers going down on the scales and that keeps you so motivated. “I knew I couldn’t miss a week because if I slipped up I wouldn’t go back. The progress keeps you going. “I think I was happier in myself and that made Ross feel happier. Although he’d never say that was what made him pick the timing, I think it played a part.” Vicki has two months before she and Ross follow in Meghan and Harry’s footsteps. While her wedding won’t be broadcast for millions to see, Ms King will no doubt feel like royalty.  Diet before   Breakfast: Nothing.

Luke Hicks burned two vibrators - worth \u0026pound66 - in anger because Danielle Gillies was away on a women-only night out. A court heard the 24-year-old found the two sex toys in a bedroom in a chest of drawers and set them alight in his rage. Hicks had downed 15 pints of lager as well as vodka and champagne during an all day drinking session at horse racing before heading to his girlfriend\u0027s flat. And he started a vibrator bonfire in fury at realising Danielle, 23, had gone out was out with the girls. His outraged girlfriend came home from the Cardiff night out to find the sex toys destroyed as well as fire damage to a cupboard.  Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard-Jones said Ms Gillies dumped Hicks straight away and he spent the next nine days begging her to get back with him. But many of Hicks\u0027 messages turned abusive and he was charged with harassment. Mr Pritchard-Jones said: He let himself into the flat and burned two sex toys that she had in the bedroom, and made a small burn mark on the chest of drawers. He sent her a constant stream of texts over the next nine days. Some were abusive, but mainly they were trying to persuade her to get back with him.” Hicks was warned any further contact would be considered harassment, but Haverfordwest Magistrates heard he continued to message Ms Gillies anyway.  Insurance worker Hicks, of Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire, admitted criminal damage and harassment. Mike Kelleher, defending, said Hicks was extremely drunk when he entered the woman\u0027s flat. He added: “He had not expected his girlfriend to go out as well. He let himself into her property and found that she was not there. He had drunk far too much than was good for him. Mr Kelleher said Hicks continued to message the woman because she hadn\u0027t blocked his number. In his eyes, because he had not been blocked, he saw a glimmer of hope, he said. He accepts that the relationship is over. The texts were born out of a sense of frustration, which grew and grew.

At around 5.30am on August 5 last year, Joseph Dunkley, 46, was at Brixton Underground station when was approached by an unknown man, British Transport Police (BTP) said. After a heated argument, a fight broke out and Dunkley made lunges towards the man with a knife. The unknown man ran away and Dunkley walked into Brixton station, heading towards a Victoria Line train. Meanwhile, a group of males, including 18-year-old Samuel Gbo, entered the same station. On a northbound service, Dunkley confused Gbo with someone else and became violent.  During the journey towards Stockwell, Dunkley threatened the group of men with a knife and then stabbed Gbo. The teenager then produced a knife and stabbed Dunkley twice on the arm. At Stockwell, the disorder spilled onto the platform where police and paramedics attended. Investigating officer Pc Neil Lane, from BTP, said: Knife crime will never be tolerated on the London Underground network, and today\u0027s sentence shows the consequence of knife crime. The Tube network is rich with CCTV, and we use this vital evidence to identify offenders and bring them before the courts. Those individuals who are intent on carrying knives should see this sentence as a deterrent to this reckless behaviour.

Glamourous three-year-old Afghan Hound AJ Nirvana Battle turns heads wherever he goes and has flowing locks that a model would be proud of. His owner Kevin Chan spends six to eight hours bathing his beloved pet, then piles on a number of products, including baby powder and hairspray. Marketing director Kevin, who lives in Beijing, China, has spent \u0026pound11,600 to date on grooming equipment and coughs up \u0026pound525 a month on bathing products to keep his pup\u0027s pristine floor-length mane perfectly preened.  The Hong Kong-born 29-year-old spends six to eight hours a week brushing the hairy hound and claims Battle is the most beautiful animal on the globe. Kevin said: Since the moment I decided to take Battle home, he was already the most beautiful dog in the world. He is a family member now, so I don\u0027t mind spending time and money on him. I need to bathe him regularly every seven to 10 days - it takes six to eight hours to bathe and groom him every time.  I do all the grooming myself and have spent about 100,000 CNY (\u0026pound11,600) to date on grooming equipment. I spend another 4,000 to 5,000 CNY (\u0026pound535) on the best bathing products every month. Afghan hounds were born as models and have their own unique characters. I don\u0027t style him deliberately, I just follow my heart.  I always tell people I didn\u0027t choose the dog but was chosen by him, therefore I have to try my best to give him the best treatment I can. Every day, Kevin, who adopted Battle two years and eight months ago, sprays a nutritious solution on the pooch\u0027s fur to smooth it before letting this sink in for one minute. Then he uses a bristle brush to ease out any knots in the pooch\u0027s mane - using talcum or baby powder to remove tangles. The 29-year-old has even bought a camera and taken up photography lessons so he can share the best photos of his pampered pet on social media.  Kevin said: Every day, I spray a special nutritious solution on Battle\u0027s fur and comb him. I have to brush him every day, to keep his fur from knotting together. When he was younger it would take me two hours a day to groom him, but now I only have to do this for an hour a time. The only thing, which is the hardest, is to skilfully comb him - then you can get the nicest shots. I began to film and shoot him from the first day I got him because I wanted to keep every single moment.

A community gardens project, a bread-baking initiative to help older people living in care homes and sheltered housing, and a children’s drama group are among those who will benefit this year. Up to \u0026pound3million has been awarded to 57 causes across the UK, making a massive impact on each deserving cause. It follows months of planning for the campaign, which led to a 2 week voting window to decide which which groups and organisations would finally be declared winners out of a shortlist of 95 projects across all 19 regions.  In each region, the three projects with the most public votes received grants of up to \u0026pound50,000 to help them continue their work to bring people together, build stronger communities and improve the lives of thousands of people across the country. So to show just how much you are helping incredible community groups make a difference with National Lottery funding, here’s a look at just some of this year’s The People’s Projects winners....

The Baking A Difference scheme, which started last year, uses bread baking to bring older people in care homes and sheltered \u2028housing together with local communities. “We are excited to get this funding because, although it is a simple idea, there are so many ways to explore it,” says project manager Fiona Smith. “Creative bread making sparks conversations, it keeps hands and minds busy, it offers physical activity and fun.” The money will help widen the project to other care homes and sheltered housing in Leicestershire, pay for the time and materials of a professional baker and train and mentor volunteers. “The idea is to create bonds of friendship and reduce feelings of loneliness, isolation or boredom,” adds Fiona. Shining Stars ASN Theatre School - Shining Stars Community Adventure  Theatre project Shining Stars Community Adventures is centre stage after receiving \u0026pound43,000 of National Lottery funding having been voted one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018.

At first, Jo Naylor told her sporty daughter Amelia, 10, to ‘stop being silly’ when she fell on the grass after crossing the finish line following the 2km run. But when she saw her daughter’s eyes roll back in her head and noticed that she was not breathing, the nurse and mum-of-two quickly went into first aid mode. Mrs Naylor said that it had just been a normal day before the terrifying incident at Swithland St Leonard’s CofE School in Loughborough. “I thought she was a bit slow, I seem to remember shouting ‘pick up your pace,’” she said.  During the race, Amelia, who was house captain of the running team, had slowed down to help a friend who was struggling. But after she crossed the finish line, it was Amelia who suddenly needed urgent, life-saving help. “She lay down on the grass and said, ‘Oh mummy I can’t breathe.’ “She became unresponsive. Her eyes were rolling back and she wasn’t answering me. It was clear she was not messing around,” Mrs Naylor said. She called for an ambulance and then realised that her daughter was not breathing. With tears in her eyes recounting the incident, Jo continued: “I laid her on her back, lifted her chin and double checked to see if she was breathing then, but she definitely was not.  “I gave her mouth to mouth, and she didn’t respond. So I checked for a pulse, I could not feel one so I started chest compressions. After one minute I thought she’d sit up,” Mrs Naylor said. But when her young daughter remained slumped and unresponsive, the nurse knew she was in cardiac arrest. In a cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, quickly starving the brain of oxygen and causing the patient to fall unconscious and stop breathing. Without CPR or urgent medical attention, a cardiac arrest quickly proves fatal. So Mrs Naylor gave her daughter chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth for 20 long minutes which kept her oxygenated and alive while they waited for help.  When the ambulance arrived, paramedics grabbed a defibrillator to shock her heart in the hope that it would reestablish Amelia’s normal rhythm. “The ambulance guy gave her a single shock. Her heartbeat stopped. And then it restarted. It was so exciting,” Mrs Naylor said through tears of emotion. Amelia was rushed to hospital where surgeons discovered that her left coronary artery was connected in the wrong place. She was operated on at Glenfield hospital in Leicester where doctors corrected the faulty connection, and Amelia, who collapsed on September 13 last year, was well enough to return to school last November. But Mrs Naylor knows that without the bystander CPR her daughter received, she would have died before the ambulance arrived that day. She said that CPR is a simple but life-saving skill that everyone can and should learn and she has shared her story ahead of the fifth annual Restart a Heart Day on October 16 which aims to teach a record-breaking 200,000 people life saving skills. Mrs Naylor said: “Doing something is better than doing nothing. I remember as a student nurse saying ‘you can’t get any deader than dead.’  “If someone has collapsed and their heart has stopped you cannot do any harm but you can help. “Simple skills save lives. Everybody in the family now knows how to do CPR. Everyone in the whole world should know how to do it. You never know when you’re going to need it. If you give it a try you might just save a life. Every year, there are more than 30,000 cardiac arrests outside of hospitals in the UK and less than 10% of these people will survive. But if CPR is started early, it can double a person’s chance of survival. The Restart a Heart campaign, led by Resuscitation Council (UK), St John Ambulance, and other organisations aims to improve these shockingly low survival rates. On Tuesday 16 October, organisations all over the world will join forces to increase public awareness of cardiac arrests and increase the number of people trained in CPR. Events will be hosted in schools, community centres, hospitals and emergency service stations to train people in essential life saving skills.

Royal aides had said recently they “hoped” Prince Philip would be at next \u0026shySaturday’s wedding. But his swift recovery was clear for all to see as he drove himself around the equestrian event – and wound his window down to talk to the Queen.

Fans have been advised to set off as early as 4am for the noon ceremony. Extra trains have been laid on for \u0026shypassengers \u0026shytravelling from across Britain. Windsor council is urging people to book parking spots. It is providing 6,000 spaces at \u0026pound30 for the day. Roads will be closed around the town from 10pm on Friday. Deputy council leader Phill Bicknell said: “We want as many as possible to enjoy this celebration and a key part is making sure people are in place as early as possible.    “We ask people to plan ahead and leave early on the big day.” Drones have been banned from flying over Windsor Castle and the procession. The ban will also be in place on Sunday to stop royals or guests being filmed leaving the overnight \u0026shyreception at Frogmore House.

The Ryanair employee was seriously injured after the commander of flight FR-3247 from Stuttgart, Germany, attempted to correct an overspeed, UK investigators have found. The plane was at 40,000ft and the pilot was about to bring the plane into land last January when a strong wind sent the Boeing 737’s speed up from 600 to 630mph in just than 30 seconds - setting off a warning alarm. According to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch report, he reacted by applying ‘double the pressure needed’ on the control. The sudden movement made two flight attendants working in the galley - the plane’s kitchen - fall and one was left with a broken ankle. The 31-year-old commander later said he’d suffered a ‘startle effect’ - when a pilot makes a ‘reflex reaction due to exposure to a sudden, intense event that violates their expectations’. It was around 4.45pm last January when the pilot was preparing to descend with both the autopilot and autothrottle engaged.  There was no turbulence and the seatbelt signs were off, the Manchester Evening News reports .  When the windspeed display started to rise, the pilot later reported, the autopilot ‘appeared not to be correcting the condition, and thinking that he had little time to react, he simultaneously pressed the autopilot disengage button his control wheel and pulled back on the control column. “His intention was to avoid the overspeed as smoothly as possible using manual control inputs.” "},{"url":null,"title":"school bans pencil cases fancy","story":"NewsSchool bans pencil cases and fancy backpacks to stop \u0027stigma\u0027 for poorer childrenThe school was poverty proofed by a charity who found it costs £581 a year for each pupil to attend\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom WilkinsonKelly-Ann Mills17:05, 11 MAY 2018NewsPencil cases are banned (Image: Creatas Video+)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA headteacher has banned fancy pencil and posh backpacks after experts claimed it costs children almost \u0026pound600 a year to join in. Pauline Johnstone, head at at St Wilfrid\u0027s Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, aims to minimise the stigma poorer pupils face. The measure were introduced after the charity Children North East carried out a \u0027poverty-proofing\u0027 audit of the school. It found that including uniform, meals, trips and optional after-school event, parents would need to fork out \u0026pound581 for each of their children.  During the audit pupils of all ages gave their feedback about their experiences. Mrs Johnstone said: As a school we had thought we did OK, it was all very equal and children didn\u0027t feel disadvantaged. It was quite difficult to listen to some of the feedback. Children reported it was very obvious that some of them did not have the same things everyone else had, she said. The school took the decision to ban designer pencil cases - some of which can cost more than \u0026pound10 - as well as no longer demanding parents make donations for pupils\u0027 dress down days and introducing a standard backpack. She added: There was a culture within the school, within pupils, that noticed those children who were never in on PE days for example.  While children who receive free school meals usually went unnoticed, they were identifiable to others on trips out as their packed lunches came in a brown paper bag, the head said. Mrs Johnstone said there was initial anxiety from parents about the pencil case ban, but the majority could see why we were doing it. She added: We don\u0027t lose out on the lovely things we do, we make sure they are much more cost effective. Children North East\u0027s chief executive Jeremy Cripps told the BBC the project had improved behaviour and helped more pupils take part in extra-curricular activities.

Forecasters are keeping watch of a ridge of high pressure on course to skirt the British Isles and lure warm and sunny weather back towards the country. Values are expected to rise up to 4-8C above normal for the time of year on Monday and Tuesday as warm air from the south dislodges the current cool and unsettled westerly airflow. Some computer models are indicating highs could reach close to 20C in north-east England by Tuesday, and up to 15-19C elsewhere. The best of the weather will be in central and north-east England where high pressure will supply a brief window of sunshine and high temperatures.  However, scattered showers are still likely in the south and west on Monday, followed by further outbreaks on Tuesday - although these will be largely confined to north-east Scotland. The balmy outlook comes after forecasts of heavy rain and thunder in parts of the west this weekend as a series of lows from the Atlantic take charge. Temperatures will also dip below average in places over the two days, with risk of frost in Northern Ireland and Wales, before rising sharply from Monday.  Katie Greening, forecaster of The Weather Channel , said the mercury will spike early next week after a bout of cool and unsettled weather over the weekend.  She said: Temperatures will be unseasonably cool the time of year next week, but spiking slightly above average Tuesday. High pressure forecast, with sunny spells and fair weather likely. The warmest day will be Tuesday, with highs peaking at 19C in London. The higher temperatures will be as a result of the flow of warmer air from the south ahead of low pressure. In its wake temperatures will lower in the following northerly to north-westerly wind.” "},{"url":null,"title":"duchess cambridges exes revealed more","story":"NewsDuchess of Cambridge\u0027s exes revealed - there are more than you\u0027d expect and she definitely has a typeBelieve it or not, there was life before Prince William for the Duchess\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor12:10, 11 MAY 2018Updated12:28, 11 MAY 2018NewsThere was life before William (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt\u0027s hard to remember now, but there was a time when Kate Middleton and Prince William weren\u0027t romantically involved. Even before their wedding seven years ago, Kate was a fixture in the public eye, popping in and out of Mahiki, shopping on the King\u0027s Road and being spotted skiing with William and their aristo chums. The couple dated for 10 years prior to getting engaged, and even squeezed in one break-up. While we know William had ex girlfriends , little is known about Kate\u0027s romantic history. But, believe it or not, she does have one... There are some very handsome men lurking in her past, and it definitely looks like she had a type. Willem Marx The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at university, meaning they\u0027ve known each other for pretty much all of their adult lives.  However, before university, Kate dated Willem Marx, who is now a reporter and, according to his Twitter bio, author of Balochistan at a Crossroads (the proceeds of which going to Polio eradication). London-based Willem works for CNBC and covers geopolitical and company news across Europe including Brexit , US-Europe relations and international security. Now happily married to Italian TV presenter Johanna Botta with whom he has one son, Willem was Kate\u0027s first love, as one friend told the . Henry Ropner News in 2007 that William and Kate had split shocked the British public, who\u0027d assumed they\u0027d soon be announcing their engagement. While this separation was short-lived, Kate reportedly didn\u0027t waste her time moping into a bottle of cheap Chardonnay like the rest of us would.  As well as becoming a firm fixture on the London nightclub scene, she was also rumoured to have dated Henry Ropner. Another tall, handsome and wealthy man, Henry\u0027s family own a \u0026pound33.7 million shipping management firm.  Henry has since married Natasha Sinclair, a businessman’s daughter, and now lives in Somerset.  Rupert Finch William wasn\u0027t Kate\u0027s only university romance.

Pamela and Chad Holbrook caught the creature in Charleston Harbour, South Carolina, and shared the finding online. Mrs Holbrook, 32, said it was a sheepshead fish, which are tough to catch, often stealing bait from the line. They crush barnacles, oysters, and crabs with those teeth, she said. They are not sharp like what we think of as incisors. But some of the teeth toward the front are skinnier like our incisors and then they go backwards to molars - well, kind of like molars. They have to have teeth to be able to rip out and then crush down the shell of oysters and barnacles.  Pamela, a marine biologist, said that one key difference between the sheepshead\u0027s teeth and human teeth was that the fish\u0027s came in rows. They don\u0027t have sets where they have \u0027baby\u0027 teeth then permanent ones come in, she said. They can hurt and crush your fingernail if they\u0027re bigger. So you\u0027ll never see a seasoned fisherman with his fingers in a sheepshead mouth. She added that the fish was delicious to eat, for those able to catch it. She said: They\u0027re fun but tricky to catch, because you can\u0027t feel them so it\u0027s hard to know sometimes. They are also really good bait snatchers! It\u0027s my favorite fish to eat hands down. It\u0027s firm, white meat with no fishy taste.

She said: “It wasn’t an extravagant white wedding. We were both only 18 and we didn’t have the money for that.“The ceremony took place at 8.30am because it was the day of the students’ charity event when they would decorate floats and parade them around the city so all the streets were closing.“After the wedding ceremony, we went back to my mum and dad’s house for a small wedding breakfast before heading to the Palace Theatre and then the carnival.“On our wedding night we went home and our best man, my cousin David Cunningham, made us stovies.“It wasn’t a grand day and we definitely couldn’t afford a honeymoon but it was fantastic.“Although all the pictures are black and white, I remember John’s suit being a powder blue colour.”In the image seen here, the young girl gifting the happy couple a traditional horseshoe is Mary’s cousin June Kay, who is now 66 herself.Mary, a retired teacher, and John, a retired roofer, have two sons, Stephen and John, as well as six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.It was one of their grandchildren who inspired Mary’s gift to John for their diamond anniversary.Mary said: “My granddaughter had asked why John never wore a wedding ring and the answer was he never had one to wear!“We were lucky to have been able to buy my wedding ring but John never got one.“For my gift to him this year, I bought him a gold wedding band which he now wears.“He bought me a dozen yellow roses but was shocked at the price of 12 flowers!”During their anniversary celebrations, the couple were visited at their Broughty Ferry home by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick who presented them with a bouquet of flowers and they also received a card of congratulation from the Queen.John said: “It has been 60 good years of happiness, laughter and banter. I wouldn’t change Mary for the world.“I was a lost man going down the wrong path until I met her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/20180510_142748_edited-605x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people norrie seeking old friends from the 50s and 60s for a dundee reunion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former Dundee man is hoping to contact some old friends from the 1950s and 60s to organise a reunion.Norrie Webber, who now lives across the water in Newport-on-Tay, attended St Michael’s School in Graham Street and St Vincent’s in Pitkerro Road.He can recall finishing his secondary education at St Michael’s just as actor Brian Cox was starting his first year and remembers seeing him around the school, although they were not friends.Norrie, 74, went on to work in JF Irvine’s in Dundee and was one of the members of staff carrying out stocktaking duties when The Beatles made a detour through the shop to avoid huge crowds of fans and reach the Caird Hall during their visit to the city in 1964.Another popular haunt was Fortes Cafe in Dura Street where Norrie and his friends would meet up and enjoy the music.Anyone wishing to contact Norrie can do so by calling 07821 480595.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41275e84ab-e1525953095948-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people paramedics thanked for helping dundee baby girl","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mum-of-two has sent a heartfelt thank you to two paramedics who came to her aid when her 10-month-old daughter stopped breathing.Catriona Grant, 29, was at home with her youngest child, Rosie, when the tot started having breathing problems just before 11am last Saturday.The Perth mum called 999 immediately, and within minutes paramedic Irena Davidova and trainee technician Valerie Fairgray arrived at her home.Catriona thanked the Scottish Ambulance Service medics who helped her through the “horrible” experience.She said: “I put in an emergency call asking for an ambulance because Rosie couldn’t breathe all of a sudden.“The paramedics arrived within minutes but thankfully she had cleared her airway on her own in that time.“The crew who arrived were so kind and I just want them to be recognised for this.“They spent about 30 minutes checking her over.”Catriona, whose daughter Isla, three, was away at the time of the incident, said she wanted to show her gratitude to Irena and Valerie – both based at Perth Ambulance Station – for their “genuine kindness”.She added: “Rosie is doing fine now. It’s very scary when your child stops breathing properly, but the paramedics were so reassuring and thorough.“They treated us with such genuine kindness and it really struck me.“I want them to know how grateful I am and what a wonderful a job they did.

There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41231a61f5.jpg ","title":"mind your own business travellers move in to car park outside closed dundee toys r us","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of travellers have moved into the car park outside Dundee’s former Toys ‘R’ Us store, just weeks after the shop closed.Two motorhomes and three caravans appeared at the Kingsway West Retail Park on Wednesday night, occupying the car park immediately outside the toy store that closed last month.The three caravans are parked directly across the store entrance, occupying disabled parking spaces.Cars have been parked alongside the motorhomes and there were also installations such as barbecue grills set up by those living there.The Tele approached those living in the caravans. Only one resident opened their door – and immediately closed it after being shown press identification.Another man swore and said “mind your own business” through a crack in his window when asked why he had parked on the site.City council officers are monitoring the situation but are yet to confirm whether they will visit.The Kingsway West Retail Park is owned by fund manager ARES, and managed by the commercial property firm GVA.Dundee City Council offers travellers a dedicated campsite on the outskirts of the city at Balmuir Wood, near Tealing.The site is six miles outside Dundee and has 20 pitches, each with its own utility unit with bathroom and shower and dedicated electricity supply.However, in the past, travellers have chosen to ignore this site and set up in areas closer to the city centre.Under current legislation, travellers can usually park on unauthorised council-owned land without issue, but may be visited by council officers to discuss their intentions.However, private landowners, such as the owners of the Kingsway West Retail Park, can call in the council or seek a court order to have travellers evicted. As a last resort, the police can also be called in.A police spokesman said: “Police Scotland can confirm it is aware of the situation and we will continue to monitor and liaise with Dundee City Council.”Dundee City Council said: “We are monitoring the situation.”The Dundee branch of Toys ‘R’ Us closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done.
