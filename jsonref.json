You can understand why, when he cares that much and he’s been banging the drum for this long,’ Harry said.Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge cited Charles’s devotion to his Prince’s Trust charity, which has helped more than 900,000 young people.

I never meant to hurt her. I know I keep disappointing her.

Pictured: Presenter Sandi Toksvig consoling him after the incidentWhether viewers will recall the name of last night’s victor a year from now is anyone’s guess. But one thing is certain: if it takes a nervous disposition, a slightly nutty character and a disarming lack of self-confidence to make a Bake Off hero, then Rahul Mandal, who emerged blinking and victorious at the end of this series, fits the bill perfectly.So did his closest rival, super-shy Kim-Joy Hewlett. The third finalist, Ruby Bhogal, revealed she had to bolster her self-belief by scribbling inspirational quotes on Post-It notes and plastering them over her fridge.With so much attention focused on the finalists, all of Asian heritage, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith were almost by-standers. Sandi Toksvig and her co-presenter Noel Fielding had more to do, mostly comforting the contestants and talking them out of their panics. But it’s a shame that in 2018 some television personalities still feel they have to flash their cleavage to get themselves noticed.Noel spent the whole weekend with his psychedelic shirt open to the solar plexus, displaying skin as white as an albino rat with a tuft of limp chest hair.It wasn’t an appetising sight. He looked like a tubby Dracula, in need of a spray tan and a waxing.

King of the Nervous Nellies was Rahul, who appears to be a frightened 11-year-old boy trapped in the body of an undersized man aged 30. During the technical challenge, when the finalists were sent outside to bake pitta breads on open fires, Rahul flung his arm up in the air like a schoolboy desperate to be excused games. ‘I need help, am I doing it right?’ he pleaded.A nd after presenter Sandi gently explained that she wasn’t able to give advice, he muttered sadly, ‘I’d better just not come tomorrow. Just utter disgrace.’Rahul began each morning with a glass of milk. I suspect this is because his mother told him to do this when he was four, and he is still an obedient boy.But all that calcium doesn’t seem to have stiffened his spine: ‘I am very, very, very nervous,’ he admitted at the start of the final signature bake, featuring decorated doughnuts.Not that he’d ever been brave enough to actually try tasting one. ‘It looks like deep-fried bread,’ he fretted. ‘I’m not going to eat it.’ Quite right – harm could come to a young fellow.

But we all know that glass doesn’t simply explode on warm summer days, or tropical countries wouldn’t be able to have windows in their houses.That jar disintegrated because Rahul’s terror had set off a vibration of physical intensity.‘This is a sign from God that I need to stop baking,’ he wailed as he swept up the fragments.Kim-Joy tried to match his levels of eccentricity, by building a ruined temple in Atlantis out of gingerbread, and Ruby popped a unicorn on her profiteroles, but there was only ever going to be one winner.‘Oh no-no-no-no-no,’ he mumbled.

And my leaf has somehow ended up looking more like a coral reef than a poppy leaf, but I was knitting at speed. Once my poppy takes its place, hopefully in a beautiful cascade in my local church, no one will notice the occasional dropped or knotted stitch.The poppy is knitted on small 2mm needles, which does make it rather fiddly. Woman’s Weekly, which supplied the pattern, recommends that you use a particular type of wool made with cotton, especially if you want to wear it on your lapel. That would definitely add a bit of structure and class to your poppy, but I just used what I had at home: John Lewis Knit in 902 Red and Rowan Alpaca Soft in 00215 Green, both double knit. The black centre was knitted with a scrap of old wool. There is nothing too complicated here, give or take the leaves.A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why.  Jan Moir: A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why  STEP ONE — THE FLOWER : Start with the petals, which are knitted inidually. You will need four of them and have to master simple techniques such as ‘wrapping’ stitches, knitting twice into each stitch and casting off purl wise          STEP TWO — THE CENTRE: Easy! Four rows plus casting off. Even I managed this without error          STEP THREE — The STEM: If you can cast on eight stitches and knit 26 rows in stocking stitch, then you are home and dry          STEP FOUR — THE LEAVES: I had to rip back my leaves twice, but it is worth it in the end. You have to cast on and cast off multiple times, then slip, knit and slipover repeatedly. Just when you think, how on earth can this woolly spaghetti possibly look like a plant, a sheaf of leaves unfolds like a magic trick  STEP FIVE — THE STITCH UP: Stitching it all together is the fun part. Sew along the edges of the stem. Then assemble the petals, with the cast-on ends in the centre.

A handover of royal power is taking place right before our eyes with Prince Charles (right) into a position of powerThat job will fall to the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Edward Young, who will go to a secure telephone line and tell the PM: ‘London Bridge is down.’Then, from the Foreign Office’s Global Response Centre in London, the news will go directly to the respective prime ministers of the 15 governments outside the UK where the Queen is also the head of state, and the 36 other nations of the Commonwealth for whom she has served as a figurehead.For a time, her subjects will not know she is dead and that the throne has passed to her eldest son. Governors general, ambassadors and prime ministers will learn first. But in the world of 24-hour news it will not stay secret for long.Prince William clashed with Charles over whether Buckingham...Share this articleAll this, however, is jumping the gun. Given the Queen’s history of robust health, perhaps a far more likely scenario is that her great age will mean she herself will trigger a period of regency, thus ensuring safe stewardship of the great office she has held and worked so hard to secure.Senior former members of her household believe the Queen will grant her eldest son the full power to reign while she still lives because of the respect she holds for the institution of monarchy.Abdication, however, is not even a consideration. One senior aide admitted to me the ‘dusting off’ of the Regency Act. My understanding is that senior figures, with the Queen’s blessing, have been examining various scenarios.      Practical and unsentimental about her advancing years, the Queen, who is known around Whitehall as Reader No 1, has had Charles added to the distribution list of despatch boxes that she is sent. In the event of her death or inability to continue through illness, the Queen has ensured that her heir is fully primed and ready to take over.Some close to the monarch say that, if she reaches the age of 95, she will make a monumental decision and choose to officially allow Charles to take over the stewardship of her reign.She will, they say, officially transfer all executive powers to him as Prince Regent until her death, when he will become king. This would enable her to fudge the issue of her not fulfilling her Coronation Oath to God and her people to serve as queen regnant until her death.          Prince Charles (pictured) is effectively already our \u0027Prince Regent\u0027, a king in all but name Others, who claim to be equally well informed, say that such a move or use of the ‘Regent’ title is not really necessary. After all, as the Queen made clear to the unassuming 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, when he went to see her on the occasion of his resignation in her Golden Jubilee year of 2002: ‘That’s something I can’t do.’Times, however, do change. In truth, with the Queen now well into her tenth decade, senior officials within the Royal Household confirm that Prince Charles is effectively already our ‘Prince Regent’, a king in all but name.Granted, Her Majesty is a consecrated monarch who pledged in her coronation oath to serve throughout her life. But can she seriously remain as head of state if she lives to be a centenarian like her mother?The last time the Regency Act was invoked was in 1810 during the reign of George III, when the monarch became permanently deranged. It meant his eldest son assumed the title Prince Regent for ten years until, on his father’s death, he became George IV.Queen Elizabeth II has enjoyed remarkably good health, both mental and physical, and there is nothing to suggest that Regency would be necessary in the way that it was for George III.Behind palace gates, however, preparations have been made in recent months for all eventualities, with Her Majesty’s blessing.Strangely, until 1937, our constitutional law had no permanent provision for a regent to cover the situation of a monarch being incapable of performing his or her duties.It was the debilitating illness of the Queen’s grandfather, George V — who suffered from chronic bronchitis from 1935 until his death — that led to the reformed Regency Act including the intriguing possibility of a Regency if ‘the Sovereign is for some definite cause not available for the performance of those functions’. It is not clear what situations this covers.Perhaps it is vague enough to allow the monarch simply to pass the baton to her heir and effectively retire — thus effecting the smoothest of successions with the minimum of fuss.The Queen is au courant with the passage of time, and how her age impacts on the institution she serves. She has, impeccable sources have told me, already drawn a line in the sand, a date when, like Prince Philip, she will effectively retire from public life.          The Queen doesn\u0027t seem to be slowing down on her royal engagements. Earlier this month she met with Queen MaximaNobody has a crystal ball. But my knowledge of the monarchal system leads me to believe that, whatever happens, it will unfold naturally. It is clear, however, that Charles’s position as the driving force of the institution in the second decade of the 21st century, as he approaches his 70th birthday, is indisputable. He, not the Queen, is the firm hand on the tiller.In the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, many long-serving staff at Buckingham Palace believed the public would never tolerate Charles becoming king.Since then, however, anger against Charles has subsided.Through hard work and consistency, and perhaps the popularity of his sons and their wives — and the goodwill they have generated — such fears have all but disappeared.He may still be blamed for Diana’s misery over his infidelity with Camilla Parker Bowles, but there’s no longer a groundswell of support for skipping a generation.It was the Queen herself who eventually urged him to resolve the ‘Camilla problem’ by marrying his lover. Mindful of his duty, Charles complied.This was a smoothing of the way forward to the next generation, not simply the glorious resolution of Charles and Camilla’s enduring grand romance.It was made clear to Charles that he had to fit in with the bigger picture and accept the shifting shape of the monarchy as envisaged by the Queen. It was a calculated risk and it appears to have paid off. The warm receptions given to Charles and Camilla when on tour, and the more positive Press coverage of Camilla, is increasingly gentle but never effusive.More recently, on her 90th birthday, the Queen took the key decision to elevate Camilla to her most senior advisory body, the Privy Council. As ever, this was all done very quietly. And, as ever, the Queen had her reasons.          Camilla is set to be Queen. Queen Elizabeth had urged Charles to marry herShe wanted her daughter-in-law to be at Charles’s side at the precise moment that he formally becomes King.This will now happen: as a privy councillor, Camilla can now attend the ceremony, normally held within 24 hours of a sovereign’s death.This leads to a more contentious question: will Camilla become Queen? Ever since the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall in April 2005, the Royal Family have gone to great lengths to avoid any public uprising over the prospect of ‘Queen Camilla’.Indeed, the official wedding announcement stated: ‘It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH the Princess Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne.’The critical word in this statement, of course, was ‘intended’. What Clarence House was doing was buying time — time for a hostile public to warm to Camilla.Prince Charles, however, has always intended her to become his queen consort.According to an inside source, he’d already decided that before their wedding.‘There was no doubt in his mind at the time about that, and I honestly don’t think anything has changed,’ said the source.‘In fact, I think he has hardened his resolve.‘For there to be any other outcome would, in his view, be to lessen his role as king.‘His marriage to Camilla is legal. She happens to be his second wife. That is it. Did any of Henry VIII’s wives not get the title?’Although Camilla has worked hard and proved a great support to her husband over the years, there is no escaping the lingering feeling that Charles’s greatest asset is also his greatest weakness.Camilla, as consort and Duchess of Cornwall, is a constant reminder of his personal failings of the past. However, more than a decade of marriage, and the fact that his second wife undoubtedly gives strength from their mutual and obvious love, should be taken only as a positive.But no matter how optimistic the palace try to be, the reality is that Charles and Camilla have both brought far too much baggage to the relationship, particularly that they committed adultery — which at the very least contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Diana — for it to be presented as anything approaching love’s young dream.I am told that Camilla will be named ‘Queen Consort’ on Charles’s ascension.There would have to be a change in the law in Britain and several other realms before Charles becomes king for her not to be. There is little or no appetite for that.To alter her status would be a PR own goal, like insisting a president’s wife should not be allowed the role and title of ‘First Lady’ — especially when the Government plans to use the royals to bolster our status on the world stage.The Duchess, 71 at the time of writing, is said to have told friends previously that she would be ‘happy’ to use the lesser title when her husband ascends to the throne.The title issue will be decided in the court of public opinion and by the Prime Minister at the time.Clarence House has always claimed that the constitutional issue surrounding the title would be ‘a matter for the government of the day’.However, all previous wives of British kings have been known as queens.Camilla has assuaged Charles’s loneliness, but knows when to leave him alone.When on the public stage, their togetherness makes them a redoubtable couple.He is the most prepared heir to the throne the country has ever had — wise, funny, intelligent and connected to his people in so many ways.She rarely puts a foot wrong on tour while representing the Queen or when supporting her husband. The Queen acknowledged this in 2012 when she awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour, Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince Charles.Camilla has earned her stripes through the love and loyalty she has shown to her husband and by devotion to duty to the Crown.She will, I am told, be deservedly given the correct rank when the time comes. Charles will rightly insist on it. ADAPTED from Charles At Seventy: Thoughts, Hopes And Dreams by Robert Jobson, published by John Blake on November 1 at £20. © Robert Jobson 2018.To order a copy for £16 (offer valid until November 4, 2018 P\u0026ampP free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.How he will be defender of the faith   Queen Elizabeth II, as we all know, is a devout High Church Anglican. Charles, on the other hand, has taken a great interest in other religions, studying both the Koran and Judaism in depth.In 1993, for instance, he said: ‘Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost.’This was widely quoted as proof that he had abandoned Christianity, though he remains a practising Anglican. Clearly, however, our next Supreme Governor of the Church of England plans to do the job a little differently.‘He is an inidual who wants to chart new territory, and that will be very interesting indeed,’ says Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. ‘He is very outspoken.’The Prince certainly caused a furore when he told Jonathan Dimbleby that he wants to be seen as a ‘Defender of Faith’ when he ascends the throne, rather than ‘Defender of the Faith’.Since then, Charles’s position on the wording to be used at his coronation has categorically changed. It has been made clear to me that Charles will ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ be named as ‘Defender of the Faith’ when he is crowned king.But he will also demonstrate in his reign that he believes wholeheartedly in the importance of his connecting with all faiths of the subjects he will reign over.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/07/51D4305D00000578-6335477-image-m-18_1540970981893.jpg","title":"Maternal Meghan plays adorable little girl New Zealand","story":"Pick pleats like the Duchess of Sussex in GivenchyGivenchy bespoke navy pleated midi skirt and jumperShop a similar Givenchy skirt at Farfetch...She’s made it to the end of her first Australian tour, but The Duchess of Sussex still had time to treat us to one final look before she boarded the plane back to England!The royal turned to one of her favourite labels, Givenchy, for the occasion.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) continue to conduct its investigations as it tries to establish what caused Saturday\u0027s tragedy. It emerged today that the model of helicopter involved in the crash, an AgustaWestland AW169, has a \u0027blemish-free\u0027 record.A spokesman for its manufacturer told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027This is the first ever accident involving an AW169 helicopter.\u0027           He is fifth on the Thailand richlist of billionaires and is said to be worth close to £4billionSrivaddhanaprabha was born in Bangkok on April 4, 1958 to a Thai Chinese family.The Thai billionaire Srivaddhanaprabha kick-started his business journey by opening a duty free shop back in Bangkok in 1989 at the age of 31.His retail company, King Power, is now a staple of the country\u0027s airports and the brand also have the naming rights to Leicester City\u0027s stadium.Having been the club\u0027s primary shirt sponsor for the three previous seasons, he wanted to step up his involvement and opted to go all in and become owner.Buying the club for a reported £39million in 2010 proved a shrewd investment as he oversaw a meteoric rise which saw the Foxes historically win the Premier League title in 2015-16.When he took over, the club had just earned promotion from League One, the third tier in the English football pyramid, and with Nigel Pearson trusted to remain in charge, the Foxes were quickly back in the Premier League.According to Forbes, the Midlands club is now valued at £371m after becoming a staple of the top half in the league under Srivaddhanaprabha\u0027s reign.Ranked as fifth on Forbes\u0027 Thailand rich list, Srivaddhanaprabha has built his empire up to a staggering $4.9billion (£3.8bn).

And if you want to join in with your own woolly tribute, our knitting pattern shows the way.How easy is it? Please don’t look too closely at my petals, which look like they have caught some kind of deadly blight. And my leaf has somehow ended up looking more like a coral reef than a poppy leaf, but I was knitting at speed. Once my poppy takes its place, hopefully in a beautiful cascade in my local church, no one will notice the occasional dropped or knotted stitch.The poppy is knitted on small 2mm needles, which does make it rather fiddly. Woman’s Weekly, which supplied the pattern, recommends that you use a particular type of wool made with cotton, especially if you want to wear it on your lapel. That would definitely add a bit of structure and class to your poppy, but I just used what I had at home: John Lewis Knit in 902 Red and Rowan Alpaca Soft in 00215 Green, both double knit. The black centre was knitted with a scrap of old wool. There is nothing too complicated here, give or take the leaves.A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why.  Jan Moir: A competent knitter could finish the poppy in a couple of hours. It took me seven hours, I don’t even know why  STEP ONE — THE FLOWER : Start with the petals, which are knitted inidually. You will need four of them and have to master simple techniques such as ‘wrapping’ stitches, knitting twice into each stitch and casting off purl wise          STEP TWO — THE CENTRE: Easy! Four rows plus casting off. Even I managed this without error          STEP THREE — The STEM: If you can cast on eight stitches and knit 26 rows in stocking stitch, then you are home and dry          STEP FOUR — THE LEAVES: I had to rip back my leaves twice, but it is worth it in the end. You have to cast on and cast off multiple times, then slip, knit and slipover repeatedly. Just when you think, how on earth can this woolly spaghetti possibly look like a plant, a sheaf of leaves unfolds like a magic trick  STEP FIVE — THE STITCH UP: Stitching it all together is the fun part. Sew along the edges of the stem. Then assemble the petals, with the cast-on ends in the centre.

Governors general, ambassadors and prime ministers will learn first. But in the world of 24-hour news it will not stay secret for long.Prince William clashed with Charles over whether Buckingham...Share this articleAll this, however, is jumping the gun. Given the Queen’s history of robust health, perhaps a far more likely scenario is that her great age will mean she herself will trigger a period of regency, thus ensuring safe stewardship of the great office she has held and worked so hard to secure.Senior former members of her household believe the Queen will grant her eldest son the full power to reign while she still lives because of the respect she holds for the institution of monarchy.Abdication, however, is not even a consideration. One senior aide admitted to me the ‘dusting off’ of the Regency Act. My understanding is that senior figures, with the Queen’s blessing, have been examining various scenarios.      Practical and unsentimental about her advancing years, the Queen, who is known around Whitehall as Reader No 1, has had Charles added to the distribution list of despatch boxes that she is sent. In the event of her death or inability to continue through illness, the Queen has ensured that her heir is fully primed and ready to take over.Some close to the monarch say that, if she reaches the age of 95, she will make a monumental decision and choose to officially allow Charles to take over the stewardship of her reign.She will, they say, officially transfer all executive powers to him as Prince Regent until her death, when he will become king. This would enable her to fudge the issue of her not fulfilling her Coronation Oath to God and her people to serve as queen regnant until her death.          Prince Charles (pictured) is effectively already our \u0027Prince Regent\u0027, a king in all but name Others, who claim to be equally well informed, say that such a move or use of the ‘Regent’ title is not really necessary. After all, as the Queen made clear to the unassuming 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, when he went to see her on the occasion of his resignation in her Golden Jubilee year of 2002: ‘That’s something I can’t do.’Times, however, do change. In truth, with the Queen now well into her tenth decade, senior officials within the Royal Household confirm that Prince Charles is effectively already our ‘Prince Regent’, a king in all but name.Granted, Her Majesty is a consecrated monarch who pledged in her coronation oath to serve throughout her life. But can she seriously remain as head of state if she lives to be a centenarian like her mother?The last time the Regency Act was invoked was in 1810 during the reign of George III, when the monarch became permanently deranged. It meant his eldest son assumed the title Prince Regent for ten years until, on his father’s death, he became George IV.Queen Elizabeth II has enjoyed remarkably good health, both mental and physical, and there is nothing to suggest that Regency would be necessary in the way that it was for George III.Behind palace gates, however, preparations have been made in recent months for all eventualities, with Her Majesty’s blessing.Strangely, until 1937, our constitutional law had no permanent provision for a regent to cover the situation of a monarch being incapable of performing his or her duties.It was the debilitating illness of the Queen’s grandfather, George V — who suffered from chronic bronchitis from 1935 until his death — that led to the reformed Regency Act including the intriguing possibility of a Regency if ‘the Sovereign is for some definite cause not available for the performance of those functions’. It is not clear what situations this covers.Perhaps it is vague enough to allow the monarch simply to pass the baton to her heir and effectively retire — thus effecting the smoothest of successions with the minimum of fuss.The Queen is au courant with the passage of time, and how her age impacts on the institution she serves. She has, impeccable sources have told me, already drawn a line in the sand, a date when, like Prince Philip, she will effectively retire from public life.          The Queen doesn\u0027t seem to be slowing down on her royal engagements. Earlier this month she met with Queen MaximaNobody has a crystal ball. But my knowledge of the monarchal system leads me to believe that, whatever happens, it will unfold naturally. It is clear, however, that Charles’s position as the driving force of the institution in the second decade of the 21st century, as he approaches his 70th birthday, is indisputable. He, not the Queen, is the firm hand on the tiller.In the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, many long-serving staff at Buckingham Palace believed the public would never tolerate Charles becoming king.Since then, however, anger against Charles has subsided.Through hard work and consistency, and perhaps the popularity of his sons and their wives — and the goodwill they have generated — such fears have all but disappeared.He may still be blamed for Diana’s misery over his infidelity with Camilla Parker Bowles, but there’s no longer a groundswell of support for skipping a generation.It was the Queen herself who eventually urged him to resolve the ‘Camilla problem’ by marrying his lover. Mindful of his duty, Charles complied.This was a smoothing of the way forward to the next generation, not simply the glorious resolution of Charles and Camilla’s enduring grand romance.It was made clear to Charles that he had to fit in with the bigger picture and accept the shifting shape of the monarchy as envisaged by the Queen. It was a calculated risk and it appears to have paid off. The warm receptions given to Charles and Camilla when on tour, and the more positive Press coverage of Camilla, is increasingly gentle but never effusive.More recently, on her 90th birthday, the Queen took the key decision to elevate Camilla to her most senior advisory body, the Privy Council. As ever, this was all done very quietly. And, as ever, the Queen had her reasons.          Camilla is set to be Queen. Queen Elizabeth had urged Charles to marry herShe wanted her daughter-in-law to be at Charles’s side at the precise moment that he formally becomes King.This will now happen: as a privy councillor, Camilla can now attend the ceremony, normally held within 24 hours of a sovereign’s death.This leads to a more contentious question: will Camilla become Queen? Ever since the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall in April 2005, the Royal Family have gone to great lengths to avoid any public uprising over the prospect of ‘Queen Camilla’.Indeed, the official wedding announcement stated: ‘It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH the Princess Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne.’The critical word in this statement, of course, was ‘intended’. What Clarence House was doing was buying time — time for a hostile public to warm to Camilla.Prince Charles, however, has always intended her to become his queen consort.According to an inside source, he’d already decided that before their wedding.‘There was no doubt in his mind at the time about that, and I honestly don’t think anything has changed,’ said the source.‘In fact, I think he has hardened his resolve.‘For there to be any other outcome would, in his view, be to lessen his role as king.‘His marriage to Camilla is legal. She happens to be his second wife. That is it. Did any of Henry VIII’s wives not get the title?’Although Camilla has worked hard and proved a great support to her husband over the years, there is no escaping the lingering feeling that Charles’s greatest asset is also his greatest weakness.Camilla, as consort and Duchess of Cornwall, is a constant reminder of his personal failings of the past. However, more than a decade of marriage, and the fact that his second wife undoubtedly gives strength from their mutual and obvious love, should be taken only as a positive.But no matter how optimistic the palace try to be, the reality is that Charles and Camilla have both brought far too much baggage to the relationship, particularly that they committed adultery — which at the very least contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Diana — for it to be presented as anything approaching love’s young dream.I am told that Camilla will be named ‘Queen Consort’ on Charles’s ascension.There would have to be a change in the law in Britain and several other realms before Charles becomes king for her not to be. There is little or no appetite for that.To alter her status would be a PR own goal, like insisting a president’s wife should not be allowed the role and title of ‘First Lady’ — especially when the Government plans to use the royals to bolster our status on the world stage.The Duchess, 71 at the time of writing, is said to have told friends previously that she would be ‘happy’ to use the lesser title when her husband ascends to the throne.The title issue will be decided in the court of public opinion and by the Prime Minister at the time.Clarence House has always claimed that the constitutional issue surrounding the title would be ‘a matter for the government of the day’.However, all previous wives of British kings have been known as queens.Camilla has assuaged Charles’s loneliness, but knows when to leave him alone.When on the public stage, their togetherness makes them a redoubtable couple.He is the most prepared heir to the throne the country has ever had — wise, funny, intelligent and connected to his people in so many ways.She rarely puts a foot wrong on tour while representing the Queen or when supporting her husband. The Queen acknowledged this in 2012 when she awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour, Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince Charles.Camilla has earned her stripes through the love and loyalty she has shown to her husband and by devotion to duty to the Crown.She will, I am told, be deservedly given the correct rank when the time comes. Charles will rightly insist on it. ADAPTED from Charles At Seventy: Thoughts, Hopes And Dreams by Robert Jobson, published by John Blake on November 1 at £20. © Robert Jobson 2018.To order a copy for £16 (offer valid until November 4, 2018 P\u0026ampP free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.How he will be defender of the faith   Queen Elizabeth II, as we all know, is a devout High Church Anglican. Charles, on the other hand, has taken a great interest in other religions, studying both the Koran and Judaism in depth.In 1993, for instance, he said: ‘Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost.’This was widely quoted as proof that he had abandoned Christianity, though he remains a practising Anglican. Clearly, however, our next Supreme Governor of the Church of England plans to do the job a little differently.‘He is an inidual who wants to chart new territory, and that will be very interesting indeed,’ says Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. ‘He is very outspoken.’The Prince certainly caused a furore when he told Jonathan Dimbleby that he wants to be seen as a ‘Defender of Faith’ when he ascends the throne, rather than ‘Defender of the Faith’.Since then, Charles’s position on the wording to be used at his coronation has categorically changed. It has been made clear to me that Charles will ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ be named as ‘Defender of the Faith’ when he is crowned king.But he will also demonstrate in his reign that he believes wholeheartedly in the importance of his connecting with all faiths of the subjects he will reign over.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/02/51D07DD900000578-6335433-image-a-27_1540951285390.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles reaction spots Instagrammer used follow New Zealand","story":"Take on the trench coat like Meghan wearing BurberryShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex has already proven her versatility when it comes fashion during the royal tour.

But as this wipes out half of the gain for higher earners, he should have come clean and mentioned this in the Budget speech rather than leave it in the Budget small print.’However a rise in the basic rate income tax threshold to £12,500, which gives a £130 saving, will still leave top earners with a total reduction to their tax bill worth £495.The Conservative Party had pledged to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and the higher-rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020. But these increases will now come into effect 12 months ahead of schedule at the start of the next tax year on April 6, 2019.The £4bn stamp duty farce: That’s how much higher rate has...Hammond\u0027s raid on Scots: Stealth hike to National Insurance...Labour revolt after John McDonnell says he WON\u0027T try to...Share this articleCritics have claimed the change benefits the wealthy more than the worse-off. But Mr Hammond told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, adding: ‘It’s important to raise all of these thresholds. We promised to do so and we have done it.’Experts had feared Mr Hammond would be forced to renege on his promise to increase income tax thresholds in a bid to cover the cost of the £20billion funding pledge to the NHS. But speaking later on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Hammond said: ‘When you make a promise to the electorate and they elect you then you have an obligation to deliver on that promise.’The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday said the Conservatives had pulled almost a million people into the higher tax bracket in the past eight years.          Philip Hammond tours the Eminox factory.  Experts calculated that half the £730 windfall of upper rate taxpayers would get wiped out by increased NI contributions It claimed that the rise in the threshold only went a small way to reversing the massive reductions since they came to power in 2010.It found there are now 900,000 more people in the higher rate tax bracket than if the 2010 threshold was maintained in line with inflation.The IFS also pointed out that the tax burden is the highest for almost half a century – back to the time of Harold Wilson.Tax receipts are now 34 per cent of national income, the biggest figure since 196970.The new thresholds will be frozen until the tax year starting in April 2021. At this point they will increase with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, currently 2.4 per cent.This will mean that as people earn more they will not automatically be dragged into a higher tax band."},{"url":null,"title":"Senior BBC reporter Dan Roan hauled air","story":"    BBC sports editor Dan Roan was caught on camera discussing the private life of Vichai SrivaddhanaprabhaRoan was picked up on a microphone saying: \u0027As opposed to the mistress who died in the crash, otherwise known as member of staff, i.e. mistress... family man...\u0027As he stood at a vigil to the dead outside the stadium, he then added: \u0027But that\u0027s what you do if you are a billionaire or royalty, it\u0027s relatively expected so we shouldn\u0027t judge.\u0027\u0027Devastated\u0027 Rebekah and Jamie Vardy weep as they visit...Will black box hold the key to what went wrong?...Share this articleRoan was picked up on a Sky News live feed broadcasting to thousands on video sharing website YouTube.The comments caused an outcry amongst fans who made formal complaints to the BBC and called for the senior reporter to get the sack.

She later had to be treated in hospital for serious injuries including a collapsed lung and a zig-zag cut down her left breast.Wilkinson of Lancaster was arrested later on suspicion of attempted murder but claimed the victim had come at her with the blade.At Preston Crown Court, she admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm after she initially denied wrongdoing. She made her boast of being \u0027your worst nightmare\u0027 on her Facebook status in which she added: \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for bull****, no-one in this town would have a conversation.\u0027The 7pm incident occurred on August 17 this year after Wilkinson suspected her partner had been having a fling with Miss Gelder.Mr Frances McEntee prosecuting, said: \u0027The case has a background which is long-standing. The defendant believed Miss Gelder was having a relationship with her partner.\u0027The complainant says that she heard banging on the door and she knew it would be the defendant because of their past difficulties. \u0027She opened her front door and immediately saw the defendant with her hand clenched and she was holding what the defendant described as a Swiss-Army knife.\u0027The complainant said what are you doing, you crazy b****? and the defendant is then said to have lunged at her with the knife. The complainant felt a number of blows to the face and body.  Wilkinson (pictured) was jailed at Preston Crown Court for unleashing the attack on the victim\u0027s doorstep  Jealous ex who knifed her former boyfriend and tried to cut...Jealous NHS worker accessed medical records of her...Share this article\u0027She tried to defect the blows of the defendant and then they both fell to the ground. The complainant was then top of the defendant, who still had hold of the knife.\u0027The defendant was then dragged away from the complainant. On lookers said that the complainant was bleeding heavily at this point. The complainant went back into the house and then set off on her bicycle while still bleeding heavily. A delivery man saw her pass out on the floor.\u0027She was immediately taken to the hospital and she had sustained some serious injuries. She sustained a number of cuts. Down the left side of her face, there is a long superficial cut.          The attacker admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at Preston Crown Court \u0027There\u0027s a puncture wound to her chest which has caused a zig-zag cut down the complainant\u0027s left breast. There is an injury to the underneath of her arm which is believed to have caused Pnuemothorax.\u0027This was a sustained assault with repeated blows delivered by a knife. It appears to be a Sommeliers knife, similar to a Swiss Army knife.\u0027When the defendant was arrested, her account was that the complainant had come at her with a knife. When the defendant was interviewed, she provided a statement which said that Yvonne Gelder came at her with a knife, but made no comment throughout.\u0027This is a high culpability offence because of the use of a knife and the puncture of the chest.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Christopher Evans, said: \u0027There were various falling outs and she is remorseful with what happened - the remorse is complete, it\u0027s extensive and it\u0027s genuine. She had a difficult childhood, particularly in her teenage years.\u0027But sentencing Judge Andrew Woolman told Wilkinsond: \u0027Make no mistake, this could have been a lot worse - the consequences could have been fatal.\u0027You have long-standing problems with the victim, maybe to do with your suspicions that she was having sexual relations with your partner. On August 17, you went to the complainant\u0027s house with what I suspect was the first sharp object you found, which was this Swiss Army Knife.\u0027You banged on the door and when she answered, you attacked her with it. She sustained injuries to her head and body and, fortunately, the slash on her face appeared to miss her eye.\u0027There were a number of other wounds one to her chest and one to the side of her chest which has caused Pnuemothorax which could have been fatal. Initially, you tried to say that she attacked you, which wasn\u0027t true, but you did plead guilty on the second occasion.\u0027I have read your letter, which is thoughtful and articulate and I accept that you say you are remorseful.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/11/15A5DAED00000514-6336713-Other_ghost_towers_in_London_include_the_Shard_where_10_apartmen-a-20_1540985625793.jpg","title":"Centre Point Londons ghost towers","story":"    London\u0027s Centre Point tower, pictured, has sold only half of its luxury flats and property firm Almacantar said it was halting any future deals after receiving too many offers \u0027well below\u0027 the asking price          Luxury apartments in the building, pictured, range from £1.8m to £55m and around half of the 82 flats have been sold, but Almacantar\u0027s chief executive Mike Hussey said recent offers were \u0027detached from reality\u0027 and said uncertainty around Brexit was affecting the market          The tower, pictured, which is near Tottenham Court Road, was formerly an office block that was converted into homes in 2015. The apartments offer amazing views of the cityFormer City of London planner Peter Rees told the Daily Mail earlier this year he had pleaded for new towers in the City to be made as offices and not homes so \u0027at least they would be occupied during the day\u0027.Mike Hussey, chief executive of Almacantar, told the Guardian it was down to uncertainty over Brexit and the prospect of tax increases on foreign investors.He said: \u0027Offers are now reflecting uncertainty on potential changes to stamp duty, taxation of overseas investors and other fiscal policy proposals\u0027.The company has now halted formal sales because it has paid off its construction debts through the previous apartment sales and has also leased retail space at the bottom of the tower.Mr Hussey, who has worked in property for decades including at Landsec and Knight Frank, where he was once the firm\u0027s youngest ever salaried partner, added: \u0027We see no point in chasing a market that is increasingly detached from reality.\u0027The £4bn stamp duty farce: That¿s how much higher rate has...Fairway to heaven: Prize-winning above-par property with...Share this articleAlmacantar bought the building in 2011 for an undisclosed sum, reported to be around £120million.The firm was set up by Mr Hussey and co-founder Neil Jones in 2010 and owns luxury developments in Marble Arch, St John\u0027s Wood and has more under construction on the Southbank. Shares are split between owners including Exor, the development wing of the billionaire Agnelli family, which runs Fiat and has a controlling stake in Juventus Football Club. According to New London Architecture, the only body keeping a record on London\u0027s burgeoning towerscape, there are planned to be 511 more towers of 20 storeys or more added to the London horizon.At the turn of the century, there were 30 while two years ago, 115 were planned or under construction.Around half of London\u0027s near 2,000 new luxury flats failed to sell last year despite having amenities including private gyms, cinemas and swimming pools.Many that do sell are bought by foreign owners who do not live in them most of the year.And according to the 2011 census, there were more bedrooms in London than people, a surplus that is accelerating. Property data firm Molior said only 900 of 1,900 luxury new build flats priced at more than £1,500 per sq ft sold last year, with another 14,000 on the market priced between £1,000 and £1,500 per sq ft. The company said it would take three years to sell all the remaining properties at the current rate of trade without the introduction of more new builds into the market.   Centre point, pictured left shortly after it was completed in 1966 and right in 1970, risks becoming another of London\u0027s \u0027ghost towers\u0027          Almacantar also said the potential of tax increases on foreign buyers was also putting off interest in the flats, pictured      One of the apartments inside Riverwalk in Westminster, where the remaining units available to buy start at £1.25million          Centre Point was described by the owners as one of London\u0027s \u0027great works of modern architecture\u0027 but it was previously occupied by campaigners for the homeless in 1974 when it was still an empty office block to highlight the problem. Activists are again criticising the tower for the same reasons more than 40 years onBut fears grow these towers will remain empty for years to come, particularly given the lack of activity at The Shard - of which 95 per cent is owned by the billionaire Qatari Royal Family who are under little pressure to sell.Meanwhile Riverwalk is part of the portfolio of property firm Derwent London, which turns over more than £200million a year and was set up by veteran chartered surveyor and developer John Burns in the 1980s.It is one of the largest developers in London and boats a portfolio worth more than £4.7billion, including more than 30 sites in Fitzrovia. Almacantar had been marketing the properties with estate agents Knight Frank and CBRE.The firm advertised the building as \u0027one of the great works of modern architecture capturing the adventurous spirit of London\u0027.Mr Hussey added he expected buyers to return after a Brexit deal was agreed and there was more \u0027confidence\u0027 in the market.He Estates Gazette magazine: \u0027When buyers feel more confident about the wider macro situation, they will also feel more confident about paying these prices again.\u0027Brutalist market: flats at London\u0027s Centre Point taken off market | Business | The GuardianCentre Point agents stood down as London resi market is \u0027detached from reality\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"My tongue fell Girl freaks wisdom tooth removal US","story":"    A young girl thought her tongue fell out when a gauze pad dropped from her mouth - much to the amusement of her family          The youngster, from somewhere in the US, was a little disorientated after having her wisdom teeth removed Her family couldn\u0027t help but laugh as the girl started to panic in garbled English with her mouth still numb from the injection of anaesthetic. In the footage, filmed somewhere in the US, the girl can be seen inspecting her mouth in her phone camera while sitting in the backseat of a car.Learner driver freaks out as she ventures onto a highway for...\u0027Well done for waiting... two points for you!\u0027 Man with a...Share this articleBut as she sticks her tongue out - to try and see the holes where her wisdom teeth used to be - one of the gauze pads falls from her mouth.Because it was red and soaked in blood, the young girl mistakes it for her tongue and starts to panic.

Denny decided to explore what it means to be a witch today and took portraits of women across the country who identify as witches. Maja (pictured), who was dubbed the ‘white witch of LA,’ stands next to a tree in a park in her namesake city. Denny said she felt it was very appropriate Maja \u0027showed up in head to toe white.’ Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Maja (Los Angeles, CA),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          Denny started photographing in early 2016 and discovered that there were many different ways to practice and to inhabit the witch identity. Dia Dynasty (pictured), is an ‘alpha witch,’ ‘shamanatrix,’ and ‘female supremacist,’ according to her Twitter bio, and she brought crystals and whips to the photo shoot. Dia Dynasty and her partner Lucy Sweetkill run La Maison du Rouge, ‘focused on expanding the BDSM experience by discussing, educating, and informing our audiences about the intersections of kink, wellness, sexuality, spirituality, and social activism,’ according to their website. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Dia (New York, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          Before each shoot, Denny asked participants to choose where they wanted to be photographed – and many selected the outdoors as a setting. Each woman dressed themselves and Denny asked them to bring along an object that felt relevant to their identity as a witch or to their practice. For her photo, Meredith brought a staff, which has been layered over time with material found or given to her, such as a snakeskin and a bear claw, Denny said. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Meredith (Moretown, VT),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York CityGrossman said she appreciated how Denny approached the project - some of the portraits are now being exhibited at ClampArt through November 24 - from an anthropological standpoint and that it reflects the ersity of the modern witchcraft community.‘For so long people have thought that witches could only look a certain a way or behave a certain a way, but, in fact, there is such a vast multiplicity of backgrounds and approaches to witchcraft,’ said Grossman, an author who also launched the podcast ‘The Witch Wave\u0027 and WitchEmoji. ‘I was delighted that there really was not only ersity in backgrounds but also ersity in styles, certainly a lot of us do wear black,’ she laughed, ‘but that’s not the only way to move in the world as a witch… we have every kind of job you can imagine, being a witch is one facet, albeit a bright facet… and so I really appreciated the fact that you get different people’s personalities (shining) through.’  Photographer Denny told DailyMail.com that the seed for the project was planted four years ago when she looked into her family’s ancestry – a project that ended up becoming the book called ‘Let Virtue Be Your Guide.’While going through documents, Denny discovered that her tenth great-grandfather was one of the central judges in the Salem witch trials and her eighth great-great grandmother was an accused witch about 20 years prior to the trials.Meet generation hex... Why millennials in search of...Share this article‘But this coincidence stuck with me and at the moment I remember kind of filing it away in my brain to sort of come back to at another point,’ she recalled.Denny, who grew up in Massachusetts not far from Salem, said she then started reading Stacy Schiff’s book ‘The Witches: Salem, 1692.’‘I just started thinking about that time and thinking about what that word witch meant back then and then started thinking about, well, you know, I had some vague awareness that there people who practiced so-called witchcraft and saw themselves as witches. So I started thinking, well, what does that word mean now, who is a witch, who claims that word as part of their identity now.’‘And that was my jumping off point,’ she said.Denny next faced the task of finding subjects and started asking around - talking to people about the idea of doing portraits of people who identify as witches. She said she found a ‘small but critical mass of five to ten people,’ and through them networked and found more practitioners.‘It’s kind of surprising. I was sort of prepared to have people to be like, ‘who the hell do you think you are and absolutely not.’ Nothing like that,’ she said.          A seminal book for many witches is ‘Women Who Run with the Wolves’ by Clarissa Pinkola Estes. That was the case for Wolf (pictured) who told Denny books were her entrée into witchcraft and that she began identifying as a witch at a young age. Wolf   is an eclectic witch and does not adhere to one label for her beliefs, Denny said. Image: © Frances F. Denny, \u0027Wolf (Brooklyn, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York City          For Deborah (pictured), witch work is about including and embracing the dark sides of ourselves, Denny said. A filmmaker and master acting instructor, Deborah works with actors that she is directing to integrate those emotions and aspects, such as grief, rage or sexuality, Denny said. Image: © Frances F.

She said talking about witches is complex because there is no one set of dogma or specific leader, and it is very open to interpretation. Image: © Frances F.

Denny, \u0027Judika (Brooklyn, NY),\u0027 2017, archival pigment print, courtesy of the artist and ClampArt, New York CityDenny noted that she is grateful that people agreed to be photographed because even now there is something at stake for people to be publicly identified as a witch.‘In parts of this country and parts of the world… you can get in really hot water for claiming to be a witch,’ she said.‘One of my subjects told me that she had been scared for a long time to do what she called and what is commonly in the witchcraft community called ‘coming out of the broom closet.’ She had been afraid to because she was scared that her ex-husband would try to take her kids away.’Denny said it is something that could be an accusation leveled against someone, and she decided to include people’s first names only and the place where she photographed them for the project. (DailyMail.com asked each woman interviewed to use their full name for this article.)Author Lilith Dorsey said that she wanted to participate in Denny’s project because it is important for her to have positive images of witches, particularly those that are women of color.‘It’s really nice that we can do these things now literally in the light of day and show people who we are and that we’re not scary or ugly or any of that,’ she told DailyMail.com.When Dorsey’s daughter, now 28, was a child, she said there was a real danger ‘that we might have been investigated by people for our practices and what we were doing.’Dorsey said she considers herself a Pagan ‘in the sense of I practice an Earth-centered religion.’Denny photographed around 70 people for the project, and there are 20 portraits and six found still lives in the exhibition at ClampArt. Before each photo shoot, Denny asked participants to choose where they wanted to be photographed – and many selected the outdoors as a setting. Each woman dressed themselves and Denny asked them to bring along an object that felt relevant to their identity as a witch or to their practice.For instance, Dorsey explained in her photograph, which is not part of the exhibition, she is wearing elekes, which are the ritual necklaces in Regla Lucumi, more commonly known as Santeria.‘It’s one of the first levels of initiation that you get in that practice and it basically means that you carry the gods and goddess… with you, as represented in the necklaces,’ she said.           When Denny first started the project, she faced the task of finding subjects, and said she is grateful that people agreed to be photographed because even now there is something at stake for people to be publicly identified as a witch. Shine (pictured) told Denny she come to witchcraft at an early age and that she sees herself as a witch shaman, infusing Yoruba, Egyptian, and shamanic drumming and trance into her practice. She is not part of a coven, but rather practices alone, Denny said. Image: © Frances F.

For nearly a month, record breaking levels of PM2.5 – the harmful, breathable particles which affect human health – swamped more than 800 million people.Since then, the government’s clean air action plan has included such measures as placing a quota on new vehicles, trying to reduce coal consumption down from 23m tonnes to a target of 5m tonnes by 2020, and creating five urban forests, 21 small green spaces, 10 leisure parks and 100km of healthy greenways in 2018 alone.The number of “blue sky days” (days of good air quality) in Beijing has increased from just 176 in 2013 to 226 last year, and yet the issue remains critical.These recent images, shot around the CBD and looking into the Forbidden City, show the difference between clear and polluted skies in Beijing a month apart (5 September and 15 October respectively)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e2bddefeaf665abf21106d8e7ece4650a775f0/324_958_3678_2206/master/3678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a900d5821b7575cec480e9204b67d996","title":"philip larkin letters home 1936 1977 review","story":"What do your parents do to you? This correspondence, edited by James Booth, reveals a new side of Larkin, as he tries to make up for how much he hated visiting his mother“My very dear old creature,” Larkin wrote to his mother Eva in August 1968, “a man has just presented me with a copy of The Letters of Wilfred Owen … Most of his letters are to his mother! The book is 629pp long. He starts his letters ‘Sweet my Mother’, which takes some living up to. I like mine better – my beginnings, I mean. My mother too probably.”James Booth’s selection of Larkin’s letters home, most of them written to his mother, is 688 pages long. “Dear Mop,” the early ones begin – he addressed his father, Sydney, as “Pop” but “Mop” also evoked Eva’s role as domestic drudge. His letters include drawings of her as a seal-like creature, often wearing a servant’s mob cap. After his father died in 1948, he began addressing her differently, as “My Dear Mop-Monst-Haugh” or “Dear creaturely one” or, most often, “My dear old creature”. The drawings are sweetly affectionate and the letters never less than dutiful the burden of looking after their widowed mother fell mostly on his sister, Catherine, but Larkin wrote to her every weekend, visited regularly and, while working at Leicester University in the late 1940s, lived with her for two years. With a library to run and literary ambitions to pursue, he couldn’t have done much more. Still, the subtext of the letters is guilt: he spent so little time with her and couldn’t help her feel less lonely.The guilt came out as exasperation and rage. The day before that letter to Eva about Owen, for instance, he wrote to his lover Monica Jones about how, once home, “I become snappy, ungrateful, ungracious, wounding, inconsiderate \u0026amp even abusive, longing only to get away, muttering obscenities because I know she can’t hear them, refusing to speak clearly so that she can hear, refusing to make conversation or evince any interest in her ‘news’ or things she has to say.” He knows what underlies this – “my anger is a fight for emotional freedom against the enemy” – but the violence of his feelings bemuses him nonetheless: “Sometimes I wonder if I’m fond of my mother at all.”For three decades, from his mid-20s to his mid-50s, until she died aged 91, he spent his letters trying to cheer her up and to suppress any filial unfondness. A few letters take the form of apologies, after a temper loss at home or over the phone. Otherwise, they are warm, chatty and anodyne, with a focus on matters he thinks will interest Eva, not literary gossip, malicious jokes or metaphysics, but the weather, meals, domestic chores (“Did I tell you that last Sunday I cleaned the gas cooker?”), work, holidays, his hay fever, his melancholy (“clay-cold depression” was something he knew about, too). He tells her how much he weighs, how badly he’s done on the football pools, how hostile he feels towards immigrants and what clothes he’s wearing, especially his choice of socks – to darn or not to darn, he asks, knowing she’ll have the answer. Occasionally they discuss his poems (extracts from Eva’s letters appear as footnotes) but there is little of what makes his letters to friends and lovers so rewarding: the jokes, anger, obscenities, agonies and so on.The preponderance of banal quotidian detail perhaps explains why Anthony Thwaite included none of Larkin’s letters to his family in his 1992 selection. Even fans who thought they could never get enough of Larkin may struggle to get through more than 600 pages of “I hope your sciatica has gone”, “I had the pleasure of finding the cheque the laundry sent me for that shirt they lost” or “Snow here today! Not very deep though”. A sample of index entries for Eva runs: “out-of-date tins of salmon … neighbour’s dog … new electric fire, cistern and immersion heater … light and heater in outside lavatory … pedal bin”. Here is such stuff as tedium is made of. And yet the book is well worth having because we see a side of Larkin little glimpsed until now: not the friend and lover but the determinedly loyal, long-suffering son. Eva may have fucked him up, but he can’t hold that against her, since she was fucked up in her turn. Larkin’s sense of “dooty” towards his mother was one of the reasons he remained single. If they married, he told Monica, there might be pressure for his mother to move in with them – a terrible prospect given her “whining panicky grumbling maddening manner”. What he’d seen of his parents’ marriage was discouraging: better gloomy isolation than marital boredom. “I think the impulse of loneliness in everyone is stronger than the impulse of love or ‘cosiness’,” he told Eva at the age of 22. He fell in love several times but his entanglements with Jones, Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth weren’t something to be shared with his mother. No other woman could ever dislodge her from being The One, or so he pretended. “We must go again up that road to the wood where we found the scarlet toadstool and listen to the wind in the trees,” he wrote to her from Belfast (where he spent five years), as if to a lover or muse.He was rarely this lyrical with Eva. As Booth says in his introduction, she brought out the prosaic and commonplace in him, and even at his most philosophical his imagery tends to be homespun: “Every day comes to us like a newly cellophaned present, a chance for an entirely fresh start,” he writes at one point, in another vain attempt to lift her spirits. But she did inspire a handful of his finest poems. When they discussed them, he had to downplay, indeed lie about, any suggestion of negativity. The room at home he talks about in his poem “Reference Back” is described as “unsatisfactory” only “in so far as it really isn’t my permanent room”, he explains. As for the line “Home is so sad”, he was “quite honestly thinking of my room in Belfast”. Well, maybe, except that he once told Jones, after a typically gloomy Christmas with Eva, “I don’t like home \u0026amp never have.”Other letters here disclose the origins of the poems he’s best known for. A letter to Eva in late April 1955 talks of him sitting “with cotton wool stuffed in my ears” to drown out the noise of the radio downstairs. The poem “Mr Bleaney”, in which he describes “stuffing my ears with cotton-wool, to drown  the jabbering set” below, was completed the following month. Larkin was living in Cottingley, Bradford, at the time, having just taken up his post as librarian at the University of Hull. If those on the appointments panel had read the poem he’d just published in a Hull magazine, he told Eva, they’d surely have turned him down: “Why should I let the toad work  Squat on my life?” wasn’t the wisest of bids for salaried employment.Whereas grumbles about work are a common feature of the letters, there’s a telling lack of reference to Sydney after his death aged 63 (as if silence on the matter might diminish Eva’s grief) and of the ECT she received during a month’s spell in a psychiatric hospital. Eva was a woman consumed by fears: of thunder, cows, dogs, planes, being out after dark. Larkin hoped against hope that she’d become more settled but she remained a creature of panic, trapped in what he called a “prison of misery”. In later years, she moved into a nursing home, but knowing she’d be cared for brought him little relief: “My mother, not content with being motionless, deaf and speechless, is now going blind,” he wrote to Kingsley Amis in 1977. “That’s what you get for not dying, you see.” Within a month she was dead. But Larkin’s new-found freedom was brief he outlived her only by eight years.The earliest letters here – from the late 1930s and 40s – give little hint of the tribulations to come. Addressed to Sydney as well as Eva, they are lively and larky, with accounts of books he’s reading, Oxford, his first job and various writers he has met, among them Dylan Thomas, George Orwell and EM Forster (“a toothy little aged Billy Bunter”). DH Lawrence is his idol: one of the few comic letters here describes the difficulties he has, at the Bodleian Library, in persuading “an unpleasant girl with spectacles – with a face as read as a peony” to allow him to read Lady Chatterley’s Lover. Ambitious to become a writer himself (“writing is the only thing I shall ever take seriously enough to give my whole attention and energies to”), he finishes two novels in two years while working as a librarian in Wellington during the war. The war itself goes largely unmentioned, except when Coventry was bombed and he worried what had become of his family.Among these early letters are several addressed to Catherine, full of an affection that sometimes deserted him once wrangles began over caring for their widowed mother (he would later describe her as his “bitch-sister … an absolutely mean-spirited self-centred little swine of Hell”). Whereas Sydney brings out the intellectual in him, and Eva the homebody, the artistic Catherine – 10 years his senior – has him testing out his powers of description: “the sky is blue, slim clouds tinged salmon by the low sun”, “smoke drifts away on the ruffling wind”. It seems his efforts weren’t appreciated: when he sent her some of his verse, she acknowledged it grumpily: “I feel miserable enough without having poems like that come.” It may be no coincidence that few of the letters between them survived. But they were closer as siblings than he liked to pretend.In the end, though, it’s Eva who dominates this collection – and who dominated Larkin’s life. “I am what her savage loving has made me,” Beckett said about his mother. Eva’s love wasn’t savage but cloying. Larkin wrote to her out of pity and tenderness, knowing how proud of him she was and how much his letters meant to her. But the guilt never left him. “Have just found out that Arnold Bennett wrote to his mother every day!” he told Eva five years before she died, as if he could have done better.• Philip Larkin: Letters Home by Philip Larkin (Faber, £40).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

All 10 of the £30m-£50m apartments towards the top of the Shard have been empty since the tower was completed six years ago after its owners, led by the Qatari royal family, failed to achieve high enough offers.More than half of the 1,900 ultra-luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, adding to fears that the capital would be left with dozens of “posh ghost towers”. The swanky £1m-plus flats, complete with private gyms, swimming pools and cinema rooms, are lying empty as hundreds of thousands of would-be first-time buyers struggle to find an affordable home.It is not the first time that Centre Point has failed to find occupiers. When the tower was completed in 1966 it did not attract enough high-paying office tenants and remained vacant for a decade, leading to it to be nicknamed “London’s empty skyscraper”.Homelessness campaigners staged an occupation of the tower in 1974 to highlight the problem and the tower then lent its name to homelessness charity CentrePoint.“Now its happening all over again – Centre Point’s redevelopers have taken fright at Brexit jitters and decided many of its luxury apartments must remain empty again,” said Chris Bailey, campaign manager of charity Action on Empty Homes.The drop in confidence among buyers appears to have caught Almacantar by surprise as the tower’s development team were very confident that all of the flats would be snapped up in short order when they gave the  a tour of the tower this summer.Kathrin Hersel, Centre Point’s property director, said the duplex penthouse ning the 32nd and 33rd floors would sell itself. “There are plenty of people in the world who could afford it,” she said. That penthouse features five ensuite bathrooms and a wraparound terrace with a vista across all of London taking in St Paul’s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and beyond to Surrey Hills on a good day.Almacantar had even sold one £5m two-bedroom  apartment to the parents of a Chinese student about to start studying at UCL.Hussey said Almacantar, which is part-owned by Italy’s billionaire Agnelli family, might relaunch sales after a Brexit deal had been agreed. “When buyers feel more confident about the wider macro situation, they will also feel more confident about paying these prices again,” he told the trade magazine Estates Gazette. Hussey declined to speak to the .Almacantar has told its estate agents at Knight Frank and CBRE to stand down. Mark Collins, chairman of CBRE, said: “Centre Point Residences is a beautifully executed project that we believe will have enduring appeal in the market.” He added they would be ready to try selling again next year when there was “a clear runway ahead”.Henry Pryor, an independent luxury property buying agent, said rich overseas buyers were very concerned about the risk of overpaying for central London properties particularly if the economy suffered in the wake of a disorderly Brexit or if Jeremy Corbyn became prime minister and introduced a wealth tax.He said: “The wealthy are far more worried about the risk of a Corbyn-led government than even the hardest of Brexits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6280d78c75003a846f99e75a51806efd7b6dfdb2/827_864_4772_2863/master/4772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82813ef7b1e4d4289d6e95808f705f8d","title":"new zealand is best place to do business but uk slips to ninth report world bank","story":"New Zealand remains top of World Bank’s rankings despite no reforms in past yearNew Zealand has topped the World Bank’s ranking of the best countries to start and run a business in 2018, ahead of Singapore, Denmark and Hong Kong.The World Bank said New Zealand had retained its position in its Doing Business report ahead of 190 other countries, despite not implementing any reforms in the last year.The UK slipped to ninth place while Norway climbed to seventh in a year when the World Bank said governments pressed ahead with a record number of reforms to business regulations and tax rules to support private businesses.Georgia, the former Soviet satellite state, retained its position at number six in the rankings, despite persistent criticism from aid agencies that the World Bank was rewarding a country with high levels of inequality, showing that a business-friendly environment is not in and of itself a means of alleviating poverty.Macedonia, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Mauritius are also among the business-friendly countries in the World Bank’s top 20 that rank among the highest in Oxfam’s list of unequal nations.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development criticised Mauritius last year for acting as a tax haven and leaching tax revenues from mainland African nations. Singapore, often held up as a model for post-Brexit Britain, recently topped Oxfam’s list of unequal nations.The World Bank Group’s president, Jim Yong Kim, said the private sector played an important role in “creating sustainable economic growth and ending poverty around the world”.“Fair, efficient, and transparent rules, which Doing Business promotes, are the bedrock of a vibrant economy and entrepreneurship environment,” he said. “It’s critical for governments to accelerate efforts to create the conditions for private enterprise to thrive and communities to prosper.”The report emphasises the efforts by developing countries to implement electronic tax payments, speedy procedures for setting up a business and the low cost and ease of settling disputes.It said a broad cross-section of economies in sub-Saharan Africa carried out 107 reforms in the last year, setting a record for a third consecutive year.The region is expected to experience the highest population growth of any region in the world over the next 30 years, raising concerns that the most populous nations will struggle to feed and employ tens of millions of young workers.Rwanda, which recently spent £30m in a sponsorship deal with Arsenal football club, carried out the most reforms in the region in past year, with seven, and moved up to 29th in the World Bank ranking.Rwanda also improved arbitration in land disputes, an area in which it is second only to New Zealand, strengthened insolvency laws to give creditors greater control and improved access to electricity, the World Bank said.Rwanda was among this year’s top 10 improvers with Afghanistan, Djibouti, China, Azerbaijan, India, Togo, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire and Turkey.Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank’s senior director for development economics and acting chief economist, said: “The ersity among the top improvers shows that economies of all sizes and income levels, and even those in conflict can advance the business climate for domestic small and medium enterprises.“Doing Business provides a road map that different governments can use to increase business confidence, innovation, and growth and reduce corruption.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253dcce32e9150eaf5d1e4c5af3efa40566ee0ba/0_179_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4c6fd5f8e71c872c4fc05b696828229","title":"britain new singapore brexit democracy","story":"Soaring above Singapore’s central business district, the seven towers of The Pinnacle@Duxton have a distinctive silhouette. The blocks are linked at the 26th and 50th storeys by bridges, each of which is home to half a kilometre of garden.In many other countries, iconic residential housing in the heart of the city would be reserved for the super-rich. But this is a public housing project.As we enter Brexit’s endgame, the “Singapore model” remains a favoured strategy for those who believe lower taxes, lower public spending and less regulation would clear the way for a more competitive and entrepreneurial Britain. The Pinnacle@Duxton offers a reminder that the social bargain Singaporeans have accepted is very different from the British way of life.The Pinnacle’s seven blocks are finished to a high standard, with amenities including a food court, childcare centre and jogging track but it is also super-dense, housing 1,848 apartment units on just six acres of land. If Britain truly wanted to become a Singapore of the north Atlantic, the change would have to go far deeper than taxation: there would have to be radical changes to the British way of life.For decades, Singapore has been run by a far-sighted elite that governs for the long term and buffers itself from democratic pressures by dealing ruthlessly with sources of political opposition. Leftwing leaders have been detained without trial, critics of the government ruined in libel actions. The country’s citizens value the stability this political setup has reated, but many of them justifiably chafe at the deplorable constraints on their freedom.The People’s Action party, which has governed since independence, is flexible about ideology. While Singapore’s rulers have declined to build a broad, western-style welfare state, the government plays a big role in the economy. It has prioritised making the Asian city a hub for hi-tech manufacturing, with companies benefiting from a strong logistics network, excellent infrastructure and a pool of engineering graduates as well as tax breaks. Singapore scored a victory with Dyson’s recent decision to manufacture electric cars there.There is plenty to admire. While there is inequality in Singapore, there is also a strong sense of loyalty and shared sacrifice. Young men required to do compulsory military service form friendships across social boundaries. State schools attended by all strata of society are among the world’s best for maths and science. At lunch hour, rich and poor mingle in hawker centres, tucking in to the same mouthwatering plates of laksa, popiah and chicken satay.Forging this consensus required a leader with singular determination and vision – Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who declared: “We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.” He was surrounded by a gifted group of politicians, backed by an efficient civil service, and showed a willingness to sweep away nearly any impediment. In other countries, ancestral languages are cherished. In Singapore, the traditional southern Chinese dialects were ditched to make way for Mandarin.Replicating the Singapore model would be a challenge in a western country with stronger democratic safeguards, a less vigorous political class, and a cynical distrust of experts.It would also require deeper sacrifices than Britons are accustomed to. Ordinary people in Singapore put up with modest living space and know they will never earn enough to afford a car. Singapore is already one of the world’s most expensive places to own a vehicle because of the exorbitant cost of car ownership permits, and has this year capped the number of cars on the road.Britain is turning to Singapore at a time when the Asian city-state’s own consensus is fraying. There is much to like about Singapore, but it is also a stressed and often unhappy place, from the schoolchildren shuttling between tutors to the office workers reporting low job satisfaction while working some of the longest hours in the world. A Singaporean campaign to encourage fathers to “eat with your family” starts from a low base: dads are urged to make it back for mealtimes just four times a year.Some of the forces that have driven its success to date mean Singaporeans sometimes struggle to find the passion or flexibility required in a modern economy. Singapore emphasizes material prosperity – this is a society in which sports cars ride elevators and designer handbags take up seats in restaurants – and hierarchy, from its exam-based pecking orders for children to its rigidly stratified workplaces. This is not a mindset that adapts easily to working at a tech startup. Singapore’s rulers are conscious of these challenges, and have begun trying to address them.Singapore is an unreliable guide to the UK’s post-Brexit future. Even if we had the capacity to emulate them, few Britons would enjoy living in a north Atlantic Singapore. And many Singaporeans think it is high time their society changed.• Jeevan Vasagar worked in Singapore as the Financial Times’ correspondent between 2015 and 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82988acb926a8c5b4e4836f78afa0c97950dc9af/0_6_2884_1731/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=242610533dd36334c6d68753f11e14df","title":"george osborne brexit newsnight brussels","story":"Scientists working deep beneath the Swiss Alps notice anomalies in their data indicating the existence of a mysterious particle unknown in the laws of physics. Hundreds of miles away, in a BBC television studio, George Osborne admits to mistakes made during his time in government. The former chancellor regrets that he and David Cameron did not make a better case for British membership of the European Union. Maybe this unprecedented ripple of humility is the substance detected by researchers at Cern. Perhaps the hypersensitive instruments of the Large Hadron Collider registered the blip of Osborne’s conscience.To be fair, Osborne was reputed to be more thoughtful than Cameron when they were in their pomp, although he came across as meaner in public. His face at rest bears the sneering grimace of a man relishing the smell of his own farts – but there is more to him than cartoon villainy.The mea culpa on Newsnight last night focused on the failure to secure continued British membership of the EU. Osborne regretted that the government had failed to speak more of the “value of immigration”. He regretted that the case for remain was not assembled sooner, noting that it had been a mistake “to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle and was wrong”.There are many reasons why the remain side lost the 2016 referendum, some contingent on the campaign itself and others stretching back decades. It quickly became clear to those whose job it was to make the case for remain that there was no foundation of understanding on which a broad pro-European argument could be erected so late in the day. There was no collective frame of reference to which a cultural appeal could be made, which is why the strategic decision was taken to go in hard on cold, hard-headed economic self-interest – the pitch now discredited as “Project Fear”.Whether that was the right choice in the last desperate months is a less interesting question than how it came to pass, when such a momentous question was put to the British public, that so few of us really knew anything about how the EU worked, or even what it really was. This is not a judgment on leave voters, by the way. Ignorance of the mechanics and history of European institutions was rife on the remain side, too.The fundamental misconception, from which most eurosceptic myths flow, is that “Europe” was something done to the UK by other countries. This expressed itself most commonly in the caricature of the European commission as robber-in-chief of national sovereignty, deploying battalions of bureaucrats whose mortal sin is not to have been elected. In reality, the apex of power in the EU is the European council, where heads of government sit. Their number included, until recently, a British prime minister whose voting rights and moral authority reflected the country’s standing as one of the top three continental players – France and Germany being the other two.If anything, the UK had the best deal of all: the budget rebate and a long list of bespoke opt-outs. So, crudely speaking, most of the time that “Europe” did something, it was aligned with choices made by the British government pursuing their view of the national interest of British voters. But it was often handy to pretend otherwise to let “Brussels” be a seasonal anti-Santa who whisked democracy up the chimney when difficult choices had to be made.As Osborne now admits, that game went on too long. When the time came to make the case for Britain continuing to exercise power through its EU membership, amplified by its EU membership, politicians had no practice in saying it with conviction – and no audience used to hearing it.The void was deadliest when the argument turned to immigration. There was no political tradition of attaching value, whether cultural or economic, to the idea of free movement. It was seen only as a cost inflicted on “indigenous” workers from the outside, never as a reciprocal benefit. Still today many pro-Europeans are afraid to make the case. Few challenge the idea that ending free movement is an enhancement of national privilege when, in legal and practical terms, it is a curtailment of our rights. It limits the freedoms and opportunities attached to possession of a UK passport as assuredly as it incinerates the security of those other EU citizens who settled in the UK, imagining that their entitlement to call this country home was guaranteed by treaty.Only 650 of those who will be required to to apply for a new “settled status” have completed the process as part of a pilot scheme. Most of the 3.5 million population of British residents from other EU countries – teachers, nurses, carers, waiters, plumbers, musicians, parents, friends, husbands, wives – must just watch the clock tick down to Brexit day and hope for a happy resolution to their predicament. Their future is underwritten by Brexiteer promises and the reputation of the Home Office. It is hard to imagine two less valuable currencies.And the bitterest part, the one that Osborne touched on, but still couldn’t quite grasp, is that British politics doesn’t even have a way to articulate what has happened to these people that they did not arrive as aliens but as citizens that the “Europe” they were free to move in was the same one we were free to move in that they were us and that the indignity we inflict on them is something we are ultimately also doing to ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6d59367009479b745dcac82e418e0a2ebddd88/0_163_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b183f0408f3395c02ec93cc45dff74","title":"ontario what to see when to visit and why you should go","story":"It’s the most populous province in the country, home of the Great Lakes and Niagara Falls, and an outdoor adventurer’s dream. Here’s the lowdown on Ontario – Canada’s natural playgroundCanadians don’t like to boast, but Ontario is bigger than Texas. Most of the province’s 14 million inhabitants live in its cities, so vast swathes of land, particularly in the north, remain a natural playground. World-class centres such as Toronto, Canada’s largest metropolis, and Ottawa, the country’s capital, make a great base to explore Ontario’s awe-inspiring destinations, including Niagara Falls, the many national parks, or the majestic Great Lakes …Wine lovers should head for the Niagara peninsula, to enjoy tastings amid the rolling vineyards on its scenic Wine Routes (there are approximately 95 vineyards that offer tastings). Few come away without at least a bottle of the region’s famous German-style ice wine from the likes of Peller Estates. Ontario also has cideries, distilleries and a lots of craft breweries. Pair local wines and beers with fresh local produce in “farm to fork” restaurants. Some of the best are in the Niagara region, around busy Niagara Falls and the historic town of Niagara-on-the-Lake try Treadwell Cuisine for dishes that use simple, tasty ingredients such as heirloom tomatoes and microgreens. Prince Edward County, another wine-growing area on Lake Ontario, is known locally as Ontario’s Gastronomic Capital embark on the region’s Taste Trail, which links restaurants, artisanal producers, and wine and spirits retailers. Mennonite farmers still bring their produce to market in St Jacobs by horse and buggy around the town of Elora, whose pretty, traditional main street is lined with restaurants. Local specialities include the maple syrup or cheeses of Ontario, German-style sausages in the Kitchener-Waterloo region, or fresh pickerel and smoked trout from one of the many lakes of the north. Northern Ontario can feel like a place apart, and it has its own delicacies. These include spruce tips, harvested in spring and added to salad or pesto for a citrus flavour, and birch syrup (yep, the local version of maple syrup). You may also like spruce beer the taste of pine works for Greek retsina so why not beer? Try it at Full Beard Brewing, in Timmins.The ethnic ersity of immigrants to Ontario has left its mark on the province’s culture, seen in local festivities such as the Scottish Highland Games in Fergus and Kitchener-Waterloo’s Oktoberfest. There are even deeper roots in the many Pow-Wows celebrating the music, dance and traditional culture of the Indigenous People. The Pow-Wow on Manitoulin Island is one of the most authentic, while the annual Canadian Aboriginal festival in Hamilton attracts thousands of dancers from all over North America. The Toronto Caribbean Carnival is regularly enjoyed by about 1 million revellers. Music festivals cover the range from classical to modern but jazz sounds a dominant note, with annual festivals throughout the province, from Orillia and Guelph, to Ottawa and Prince Edward County, as well as Toronto and its notable Beaches Jazz festival. Quaint Elora showcases classical, folk, pop and jazz music in its annual festival, while Ottawa also puts on a Bluesfest. Northern Ontario, around Thunder Bay and Sault Ste Marie, is host to Culture Days every September, highlighting local talent in the arts. Sault Ste Marie’s WTF festival in June also brings the best of Canadian comedy to the region. For theatre, lovely Stratford is (obviously) the home of a Shakespeare festival, and Niagara-on-the-Lake celebrates the work of George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries. Ottawa’s National Arts Centre is Canada’s largest centre for the performing arts, with theatre as well as opera, ballet and contemporary dance. You’ll also find Canada’s impressive National Gallery in the capital, which features masterpieces of Canadian and Indigenous art.Much of Northern Ontario is a playground for lovers of the great outdoors, a place where bears, wolves and moose still roam wild. This great Canadian Shield landscape of endless forest is best explored by floatplanes. Fishermen, hikers, canoeists and campers are dropped off at remote lodges, such as Lodge 88, to experience nights around the campfire under epic night skies as part of a “fly-in” wilderness experience. More sedate visitors simply rent a houseboat and enjoy fishing in some of the 70,000 lakes of “Sunset Country” in the north-west. Nearer to Toronto are provincial parks such as Algonquin, 7,800 square miles of lakes and forests, with 1,000 miles of canoe trails. In winter, it’s time to break out cross-country skis, snowshoes, dog sleds and snowmobiles. Niagara Falls is a complete contrast, with its casinos and thrill rides. Ride a helicopter over the falls, get soaked by its thundering spray on a jetboat, or brave the MistRider zipline.Ontario’s hot summer and cold winter are the best times to explore the outdoors, with the spring ideal for enjoying its cities – autumn, with its magnificent colours, offers the best of both. In summer, locals escape the city heat for weekend cottages along the shores of the Great Lakes or by the water in Northern Ontario. This is when resort towns come alive with music and arts festivals, and vineyards and restaurants thrive. In winter, the first essential is to take in an ice-hockey game. If that inspires you, the Rideau canal outside Ottawa is the place to try ice-skating yourself. Be warned: pretty much every Canadian can skate backwards.

Though the game industry is certainly not perfect, as an omnivore my preference is to eat a wild or semi-wild animal from a sustainable, environmentally responsible source – not always a given with game – than one that’s spent its entire life in captivity. Feel free to tell me I’m wrong below the line.Thankfully, the days of birds being hung so long that they turned green are largely a thing of the past, but game’s full flavour is still infinitely more interesting than most intensively farmed meat. This free-range lifestyle does mean that cooking it can be a bit of a culinary Russian roulette. A pheasant is a fine thing to roast, but if you have your suspicions that it might not be in the first flush of youth, you’re better off opting for low and slow in a stew that can, on high days and holidays, be easily turned into a pie. Perfect for autumnal dinners, with a side of root veg and bitter brassicas – and some sloe gin for pudding.The nature of game season means you’re more likely to end up with whatever’s been unfortunate enough to find itself in front of the guns that weekend than to pick and choose as if you’re in a supermarket. So though I try recipes using pheasant, wood pigeon, partridge and rabbit, it doesn’t seem to make sense to dictate the specifics. I will, nevertheless, pass on the advice from the west London butcher C Lidgate to use equal parts “dark meat, such as venison leg or shoulder, mallard duck and wild boar, along with paler game (pheasant, rabbit and suchlike)” if possible – it’s just more interesting.If you start with whole birds, as Gary Rhodes suggests in his underrated New British Classics, you will need to take the breasts off the bone, though I wouldn’t bother boning the legs: life’s too short, so chuck them all into the pot. This method allows you to make a game stock with the carcasses, which can be used in the gravy, so it has its benefits despite the extra work involved. That said, most game dealers sell bags of mixed game that are ideal for the purpose.Rhodes marinates the meat for 24 hours in a heady mixture of reduced red wine, port, brandy and aromatics, but I’m not sure it’s a coincidence that much of the breast meat becomes mealy and dry: Harold McGee says that after about two hours, the acid in such marinades starts to adversely affect the texture of the meat, which I suspect is what happened here.Lidgate’s also says that “the other trick is to use the best smoked bacon you can buy – the stronger the smoke, the better. As it cooks, it combines with the other ingredients to release a magical, wintry aroma.” I reckon they’re right, but that’s as much for the fat it releases as for the smoky flavour, which goes so well with game – a notoriously lean ingredient that can do with all the help it can get. I’d recommend frying the bacon to render the fat, then scooping it out and adding it to the pot towards the end of cooking, so it doesn’t end up flabby and sad. Grigson recommends serving it in “little rolls”, which feel festive and have the benefit of being big enough to pack a real punch.This is arguably even more important than the meat – a stew without gravy is, well, if not a tragedy, then certainly not a stew. All the recipes I try make liberal use of red wine and stock, for either game or chicken, with the exception of Grigson’s, which uses pheasant poaching liquid and leaves out the booze altogether for a white sauce that, though delicious, reminds me and my testers of a chicken and mushroom pie. Game seems to demand something richer and fuller bodied.That said, Dickson Wright’s 15th century-inspired recipe packs almost too much of a punch: the sauce is so thick that it’s more like a relish than a gravy. Rhodes goes slightly too far the other way: having marinated the meat in an entire bottle of claret and other alcohols overnight, he cooks it in this marinade and homemade game stock – which also includes a bottle of red. It’s delicious, but “more like a coq au vin”, apparently. Certainly it lacks the meaty depth of Macdonald’s and Lidgate’s sauces, which contain more modest amounts of wine and stock.They also both thicken their sauces with flour, which I think is essential for a proper gravy: a jus, the kind of thing liable to run off your plate while you’re helping yourself to mash, is not satisfactory here. If you’d prefer to keep it gluten-free, use arrowroot or cornflour instead.Meat stews need vegetables like a martini needs a garnish – you can do without in extremis, but it’s a bit dull. Mushrooms are popular with game, possibly for reasons of seasonal synergy, which pleases me more than the fungi – though I can see they offer textural interest, so I allow myself to be overruled by my more mushroom-tolerant testers. Carrots are always a good addition to give sweetness to meaty things. The same goes for onions, and, against my better judgment, having spent 15 minutes peeling the tricksy little things, I’m going to use the whole small ones specified by Rhodes. Macdonald’s shallots will probably be easier to find and work just as well. Leaving the onions intact prevents them disappearing into the sauce during cooking.I don’t think the sauce needs garlic, and Rhodes’ celery feels more savoury than the stew needs – most game is emphatically savoury (as opposed to the sweetness of, say, lamb or pork), so I’d prefer to keep the gravy a little softer.Dickson Wright’s medieval recipe is packed with glorious spices: cloves, cinnamon, ginger, white pepper and saffron, plus a teaspoon of sugar – not exactly what my testers are expecting from a game stew, admittedly (“Is this a tagine?”), but a happy reminder of what passed for British food before boiled beef and cabbage. Instead, I’ll be opting for the more usual combination of juniper berries, for their faintly foresty notes, thyme and bay – all herbaceous flavours that seem fitting with game.I’ll also be adding Rhodes’ redcurrant jelly, though Macdonald’s bramble jelly or Lidgate’s cranberry sauce would also supply the requisite fruity notes. It shouldn’t need his red wine vinegar, however, or Macdonald’s Worcestershire sauce (“only Lea \u0026amp Perrins will do, because it contains the vital ingredient of anchovy”, she explains): too tangy for my liking, though if you think it tastes a bit flat, either might well come to the rescue.Dickson Wright’s birds are gently braised in a relatively small amount of liquid, but everyone else simmers their meat in more copious amounts of gravy, which suits my plans just fine. Though it’s perfectly possible to get a good result on the hob, I always prefer, like Rhodes and Macdonald, to cook stews in a moderate oven: it’s easier to keep the temperature constant that way and harder to overcook the meat and dry it out.If you’d like to turn the stew into a pie, allow it to cool completely, then cover it with pastry. Grigson reckons that “many people prefer a good shortcrust with meat”, but my testers disagree. Macdonald’s puff pastry proves much more popular in this instance, though Rhodes’ rough puff would be just as delicious, if you have a yen to make your own.Prep 35 minCook 75 min (115 min + cooling if making a pie)Serves 625g butter100g smoked streaky bacon rashers, rolled up8 small onions or shallots, trimmed and peeled2 sprigs fresh thyme1 bay leaf6 juniper berries, roughly crushed1kg boned game, cut into 4cm chunks – ideally a mix of dark and light game2 tbsp flourSalt and black pepper200ml full-bodied red wine400ml good chicken or game stock75g redcurrant jelly2 carrots, cut into 1cm chunks150g small mushroomsTo make it into a pie (optional)500g puff pastry1 egg, beatenHeat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2.

Arrange the bacon on top, leave the lid ajar and bake for another 30 minutes.Test the meat – it should be tender – season to taste and serve with root veg and mash.If you want to turn the stew into a pie, leave the meat to cool completely, then tip into a pie dish. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface, then cover the pie, pressing it down on to the rim of the dish to seal. Snip a few small holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape, brush all over with the beaten egg and bake at 200C390Fgas 6 for 30-40 minutes, until golden.• Game: love it or hate it?

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“What is the fastest debut goal ever scored?” wonders Carl Worswick.Jürgen Klopp likes his players to have a bit of pace to their game and new arrival Milos Jojic got in his manager’s good books at Borussia Dortmund in February 2014, scoring with his first touch just 17 seconds after being sent on against Eintracht Frankfurt, for an all-time Bundesliga record. Julian Unkel adds: “He also scored in his debut for the Serbian national team, but it took him four whole minutes to do so.” Doubling Jojic’s mark is Tony Cottee, who for a brief time was England’s most expensive footballer having arrived at Everton from West Ham for £2.2m in August 1988. Cottee quickly replied to any “what a waste of money” chants with a strike after 34 seconds against Newcastle at Goodison Park, before going on to claim a hat-trick.Michael Ricketts may well feel aggrieved not to be mentioned a little higher up, but unfortunately we’ve been unable to find a proper record of the timing of his goal for Walsall against Brighton (them again) in May 1996 as the 17-year-old scored with his first touch.“Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang entered the pitch in the 61st minute against Leicester,” tweets Emerytus. “He had two goals on his account by the 66th. Has any sub taken less time to score a brace?”Over to Jon Keen: “I can’t beat it, but I can just about equal it – in January 2013 in Reading’s match away at Newcastle, Adam Le Fondre came off the bench in the 71st minute, and by the 76th minute had scored twice to win the match for the Royals. Then, just 11 days later, he came off the bench at home to Chelsea and scored a three-minute brace to secure a 2-2 draw – however in that second instance it did take him 21 minutes to open his account.”Darren Jalland has a prime example of when a record supersedes an equally remarkable feat within it, as Bournemouth’s James Hayter proved against Wrexham on February 24, 2004 with two of his three goals inside 45 seconds. “Hayter came on as an 84th-minute sub with his side already 3-0 up. He proceeded to score with his first two touches, both in the 86th minute. Then, for good measure, he rounded off the Football League’s fastest ever hat-trick in the 88th minute – 140 seconds for the whole thing. Sadly, Hayter’s parents left the match just before he entered the fray in order to catch the last ferry back home to the Isle of Wight, so missed their son’s moment of glory.”Meanwhile, Mark Jameson recalls a Berlin City Cup tie between Union Berlin and CFC Hertha 06 on 6 March 2007. “Daniel Teixeira (still the best ever striker in the red of Union, 67 goals in 78 games officially) dusted off his boots at half-time and, aged 39, scored in the 47th, 49th and 51st minute for a six-minute hat trick.”“Has any team, in any professional league, finished a season with negative points?” enquires Doug Zanger.Rob Lawshaw has taken a deep e and plucked this gem out for us. “Maccabi Umm al-Fahm in the Israeli Second Division in 2013-14 finished on -4, having been deducted five points after managing one draw all season.

He was playing for Sheffield United at the time, and flying so low beneath the radar that Eddie Howe was able to pick him up this summer for a mere £10m, rising to, wait for it, £11.5m.That money is not exactly peanuts, but for a 20-year-old home-produced player with an international pedigree (Brooks has since turned 21) it is the nearest thing you will find to a bargain in the absurdly over-priced marketplace of English football.Talking of English football, and international pedigree, Brooks now plays for Wales, and his decision to opt for the country of his mother’s birth after trying out for both nations at junior level may yet become a source of regret to England managers of the future. Chris Coleman, significantly, called him up for a Welsh friendly while he was still in Sheffield.Despite his slender build and impossibly youthful appearance, Brooks was making a name for himself, even when spending a handful of games, Jamie Vardy-style, on loan to Halifax. So if Bournemouth have ended up with one of the steals of the season, it is tempting to wonder why no one else thought of doing the same.Not Manchester City, obviously, because they had Brooks in the first place and they have so much talent crammed into their first-team squad that Phil Foden is struggling for game time and Jadon Sancho has left for Germany. Perhaps not Chelsea or Liverpool, for similar reasons. But how about Everton, who have picked up a few decent Welsh players over the years? Or Manchester United, the club Brooks supports, the one with a long-standing tradition of sourcing and encouraging local youngsters?This is not to suggest that United presently have a hole for an attacking midfielder that needs filling, though they must have thought so when they recruited Alexis Sánchez on such spectacular wages a little less than a year ago. United also have Paul Pogba, Fred and Juan Mata jostling for midfield places at the moment, not to mention their own Warrington-born product in Jesse Lingard, so there is no pressing reason to be scouring the country for promising prospects that might be available quite cheaply.The question is more a rhetorical one. Would United be interested in a promising 20 year old at £10m, or would they rather have a marquee name, or record-breaking capture, that would then incur Mourinho’s sarcasm by finding it hard to settle into the side?Bournemouth probably have a unique advantage here, because they can take a player like Brooks and put him into the team without worrying too much about which established international and his agent are going to be upset by being left out. The player can then sink or swim according to his ability and aptitude, which is sort of old-fashioned but probably how it should be.Brooks is definitely swimming and not sinking at Bournemouth. “There hasn’t been a bedding-in period,” Howe said admiringly a few days ago. “David fits well into the team and he has got better as the season has gone on. He suits our style of play and when we first scouted him at Sheffield we thought we saw enough to suggest he could be outstanding in the Premier League.”This might just be the most uplifting story since Liverpool took a chance on Andy Robertson from Hull City, who then seized his own chance and turned himself from a squad signing into a consistently excellent first-team regular. It also brings to mind Arsène Wenger’s comment after Leicester had signed Riyad Mahrez for £400,000 and turned him into a title winner. The then Arsenal manager said he would have been mocked, presumably by board and fans alike, had he produced an unknown from French football costing so little. He would at the very least have been accused of parsimony and lack of grand ambition.The general feeling seems to be, even among those who should know better, that genuine quality starts at around £25m and that anything substantially cheaper is a risk. This is what happens when clubs have too much money. The easy option is to keep handing it over, in the agent-fed belief that there are very few players out there who will improve a good side.Yet for every Virgil van Dijk there is a Romelu Lukaku, a Sánchez or a Pogba, and for every expensive misfit there is a relative unknown who can do the job from day one. Leicester ended up making a £59.6m profit on Mahrez, recouping their modest outlay more than a hundredfold. Bournemouth are not looking to recoup anything at the moment, they are simply sitting pretty because they have a recruitment team capable of recognising potential and a manager willing to trial a young prospect from the Championship.Brooks should count himself lucky, because at a time when young English talent is looking to the Bundesliga, what Bournemouth are able to offer is becoming quite rare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3f33945454075f3e60f0ce19fc9c64865022db9/0_31_2028_1217/master/2028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab5b94b95756782e1490a6f00475f3ad","title":"frank lampard derby chelsea cup tie","story":"“It will feel nice,” says Frank Lampard, chuckling a little sheepishly when asked about the inevitable moment when the Chelsea supporters sing his name on his Stamford Bridge homecoming. “I always appreciated it as a player. You work as a player to try to please the fans. They pay the money to come and watch you – they are the club. To be getting that support after, when you are working for an opposing team, yeah … it will be nice.”The corresponding “Super Frankie Lampard” banner will doubtless be draped across the Matthew Harding Stand, opposite the Shed End, on Wednesday evening. As Lampard puts it, going back to Chelsea with Derby – in only his 19th competitive match as a manager – is a big deal. In his first game in charge, at Reading in August, he masterminded the art of the smash and grab, and since the birth of his daughter, Patricia, six weeks ago, he admits to being torn over formations at 3am while on bottle duty. It has all been quite an induction to life in the technical area. His team are in a good place, though, unbeaten in five matches and having lost once since that penalty shootout win at Old Trafford in the previous round.It will be strange, though not a totally foreign feeling for Lampard having played and scored against Chelsea with Manchester City in the twilight of his career four years ago. “I think it is slightly different as a manager,” he says. “There were mixed emotions on that day, certainly, because I was doing my job for Man City. Everybody knew I was a Chelsea man and, if I had had my way at that point, I would have stayed there until the end of my career. It didn’t work out that way, so to go up against them and score was a difficult one for me. I was doing my job but I love Chelsea as a club I have a strong bond with the fans that will hopefully never go. But as a manager, it’s my job. It’s up to my players to go and perform and it’s my job to prepare them.”As Lampard is keen to stress, it will not just be a special game for him but also his assistant, Jody Morris, the former Chelsea midfielder and more recently the under-18s manager, plus the first-team coach, Chris Jones, who spent 12 seasons at the club.It will also be a unique occasion for Mason Mount, the talented teenage midfielder called up to Gareth Southgate’s England squad earlier this month, and Fikayo Tomori, who have both been granted special permission by Chelsea to play against their parent club. For Mount, who has excelled on loan in the Championship this season, it is another opportunity to impress against what could be a midfield axis of Cesc Fàbregas, Mateo Kovacic and Ross Barkley. In defence, it will be another test for Jayden Bogle, though the 18-year-old ably coped with Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial in the previous round. As for Mount, Lampard believes his work rate without the ball continues to mark him out from the crowd. “Mason can be very special,” he says. “All of the signs are there.”• Paul Lambert is the first person to manage both Ipswich Town and Norwich City, but the Scotsman is unfazed by how supporters of the former may view him after six years in charge of their arch-rivals. Ipswich have registered one win in 15 matches and host Preston on Saturday. “There are no concerns,” Lambert said. “It’s seven years ago, I had three fantastic years there. I don’t want to hark back. I want to focus on Ipswich now and get this team away from the bottom of the table. I’ll be judged from now on in.”• It is partly due to the congested nature of the Championship, but Birmingham City are only six points off the top. An unbeaten run of 11 matches and four straight wins has accelerated Garry Monk’s side towards the early play-off pack. Che Adams, the 22-year-old forward, has been particularly impressive, alongside strike-partner Lukas Jutkiewicz. “There has not been a second’s thought about where we could finish or league positions,” Monk said. “Remember where we are coming from, this club has been facing relegation on the last day, some of these players have been involved in that.”• Bristol Rovers were the last team to win successive promotions from the National League to League One in 2014-15 and 2015-2016, and Tranmere Rovers may quietly fancy their chances of repeating that feat. James Norwood has built on the 23 goals he scored last campaign, with 10 so far this season, while Larnell Cole, who started his career at Manchester United, and Harvey Gilmour, the 19-year-old on loan from Sheffield United have showcased a touch of class. The latter, described by Rovers manager Micky Mellon as a “real throwback”, played under-23s football at United alongside the Wales winger, David Brooks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58eca0c36f70c545928cd37e6667d16355a3b5e1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bd1efe4647317bf83b517b91458171a","title":"ghosting busters why tech companies trying stop blanking each other","story":"We’ve all had to deal with the person who starts a friendly chat then just … vanishes. Dating apps, Facebook and Google think they have the answers. But why do they care?This Halloween, ghosts aren’t welcome. Two dating apps have announced plans to use the season to crack down on the rudest of social media villains, the ghoster: the person who enthusiastically replies to your messages, starts a friendly chat and then, one day, just … stops.Earlier this week, Bumble, the woman-friendly dating service, announced it had created the post of “ghosting specialist”, bringing the journalist and author Kate Leaver in to hear confessions, dispense advice and be a shoulder to cry on for those whose attempts to find love ended with messages echoing in the void.Another dating service, Badoo, has gone one step further, announcing plans to prompt would-be ghosts to reply to their ghostees, with a series of suggested responses, such as: “Hey, sorry for the late reply. When are you free to meet?” or “Hey, I think you’re great, but I don’t see us as a match. Take care!”They may be seasonally appropriate, but it’s hard not to view the proposals with an air of cynicism. After all, the last thing a dating app wants is its users giving up on dating – or, God forbid, continuing to date, but without using dating apps.Leaver insists such suspicions are misplaced. Her role, building on the expertise she developed writing her book The Friendship Cure, is firmly focused on pushing for “a revival of kindness and respect”, she says. “There are a lot of broken hearts and confused people these days. People are ghosting everyone all over the place.“I think people are too frightened, or too lazy, or too cowardly to have the difficult conversations that need to be had,” Leaver adds. “There has been some pretty extreme psychological damage for people who are living without any explanation as to why they’ve been ghosted because we tend to fill in the silence with our own insecurity.”Badoo emphasises the positives of its app’s feature: “Badoo has 60 million monthly active users. The feature itself simply intercepts the ‘ghosting’ process by encouraging users to reply. It also prompts those who are actually interested in their match to get the ball rolling and meet in real life.”Cynical or not, dating apps are only the latest companies to nudge users to participate more, under the guise of helping them “connect” with each other. Google, for instance, recently updated Gmail to introduce a feature called “nudges”. The service, which is on by default, prompts users to reply to emails that they “might have forgotten to respond to” and to “follow up” on emails they sent that never received a reply.While it can occasionally be useful (who among us hasn’t closed a message intending to reply to it in five minutes, only to leave it for five days?), the feature is attempting to fight a symptom of information overload by simply adding more information to the pile. It’s not enough to ignore an email. We now have to ignore it twice. In the meantime, the message is there , in bright orange, reminding you that it was “received five days ago. Reply?”Then, when you do click to reply, there are yet more nudges, from Google’s “smart compose” and “smart reply” features. The company is so eager to get users to communicate that it is now more than capable of hosting a conversation with neither person participating at all – just an endless stream of algorithmically composed “Thanks!”, “OK then!”, “See you later!” and “Ha ha, yes!” going back and forth, until one or both crack and resort to actually typing.Could nudging ghosters in the dating world simply add to the overload of the modern era? After all, as the psychologist Maya Borgueta has written in HuffPost, “ghosting is avoidance and often stems from fear of conflict. Which means that, at its heart, ghosting is about wanting to avoid confrontation, avoid difficult conversations and avoid hurting someone’s feelings.”If that is the case, Badoo’s pushy attempts to restart conversations could have the opposite effect to that intended: if you ghost because of a fear of confrontation, then it’s not much help when your dating app begins confronting you.At least Google’s nudges can be legitimately defended as productivity tools and Badoo’s as helping get the ball rolling on real dates – presumably the goal of everyone using a dating app. For the really thirsty nudges, you simply need to look at the largest social network of them all: Facebook.For a company with almost 2 billion users, an advertising platform that prints money, and no natural predator in sight, Facebook operates with an almost pathological paranoia. The company is constantly panicking about potential threats to its lead, switching wildly between various priorities for its apps, algorithms and users. First, video was the future, then live video, then groups and now “meaningful connections”.What that leads to in practice is bizarre inventions such as “Friends Day”, the anniversary of Facebook’s founding in February 2004, when the company tries to encourage users to post messages to each other. This year, that involved encouraging people to give each other “friend awards”, such as “my favourite weirdo” or “always has my back”.In the industry, these nudges have a name: “growth hacking”, sending little notifications to persuade users to open the app, boosting figures such as DAU (daily active users) just in time for the quarterly earnings calls. And they owe the intellectual framework to the behavioural economics school of nudge theory, which argues that mild changes in information presentation can have large effects on inidual behaviour.But there is a growing movement against such mild nudges. In theory, they allow governments and companies to shape behaviour for the better, while still preserving the freedom to opt out if the inidual so desires in practice, some argue, they are a far deeper attack on agency than simply forcing people to comply, as people who don’t know they’re being coerced are denied the freedom to object.Steven Ledbetter is the CEO of Habitry, which, yes, teaches companies how to apply “motivation science” to “make their products more engaging”. But, he argues, far too many people fail to treat users like human beings. “We think these bullshit behaviour-change technologies almost always have the feature of thinking human beings would just ‘be happier’ if we were more predictable. Had less autonomy. Were more like robots. Were easier to nudge.”By all means, take heed of Bumble’s campaign against ghosting and do your friends and lovers the courtesy of telling them when you are breaking up with them, even if you don’t have the courage to explain why. But next time you are about to sit down and write a message just because an app told you to, perhaps pause and wonder if being more like a robot is really how you want to live your life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d337b933f9252a4474ccd190432b0127e60123d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7445ca5209d30d177c667fb33ee64136","title":"how queer male pop is finally back in bloom","story":"The 80s put the gay man front and centre of pop. Then came the Aids crisis – and three decades of demonisation and displacement. As Troye Sivan leads a new wave of gay stars, has true change finally arrived?Troye Sivan is the hottest gay pop star in the world. For his legion millennial and Generation Z fans, he’s among the first artists of their lifetime to frankly explore gay sex in pop – notably on his recent second album, Bloom – and they’ve hailed him as a trailblazer. But Sivan is part of a complex legacy of male queerness in music, one that exploded during disco and commanded the mainstream centre in the 80s only to wither in the 90s. Why has it taken two decades for the gay male experience to reclaim its place in pop?The 80s was a perfect storm of male queerness for many reasons. The winds of the gay liberation movement had been blowing strong for a decade: queer black men such as Sylvester had been at the heart of disco and the children of Bowie were coming of age just as MTV, a new medium that valued the high-energy visuals of queer nightclubs, was launched.Queer male pop artists were previously few and far between: Little Richard’s lyrics about anal sex were cut from Tutti Frutti, and it only took Bowie’s arm draped over the shoulder of Mick Ronson on Top of the Pops in 1972 to send middle England reeling. Come the 80s though, acts such as Bronski Beat and Frankie Goes to Hollywood became “the gay heroes of the decade”, says Paul Flynn, author of Good As You: 30 Years of Gay Britain. “There were stars in the 80s who were completely transparent about their sexuality from the start, and whose gayness was absolutely integral to their music.”Synth-pop group Bronski Beat’s debut single, Smalltown Boy, about a gay man leaving his homophobic home town, charted globally in 1984. (The number for the London Gay Switchboard was etched into the runout groove.) A remastered version of their debut album Age of Consent arrived this month. “At the time we were just three gay guys who started a band – we didn’t feel like part of any particular movement,” says Steve Bronski. “Of course, it would transpire many years later that there were more gay artists than the public were led to believe.”It took at least a decade for the era to be recognised as a golden age of gay pop, because it didn’t make itself explicit at the time. “You had a backcloth of pop music that was absolutely full of gay people, even megastars like Freddie Mercury and Elton John, but most of them were living some sort of closeted existence,” Flynn says. “There was Boy George, Pete Burns – who was married, but who is what you would now call queer – Morrissey singing about ‘handsome devils’, Pet Shop Boys with their slightly more opaque readings of sexuality, Marc Almond from Soft Cell, George Michael, who was closeted even though everyone in the industry knew he was gay.”The queer male figure in 80s pop was largely indistinct, visible only through the slats of half-open closet doors. “Understanding 1980s pop music in relation to sexuality requires a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance,” says LGBTQ historian Dr Aaron Lecklider of the University of Massachusetts Boston. Some queer men were in, some were out and some straight men revelled in what is now recognised as a queer aesthetic – the haze of glitter blurred everything. The new romantic look was androgynous and flamboyant, but these signifiers didn’t instantly register as queer. As critic Alfred Soto wrote of George Michael: “Fine with queerness so long as the artists didn’t ask or tell, the 1980s were the last time pop stars could wear fingerless kitchen gloves without audiences assuming they were gay.”Gay author and writer Jeremy Helligar is among those who disagree. “It’s similar to the way British groups like the Rolling Stones and the Animals borrowed heavily from black R\u0026ampB music and put it in a white package that the masses could enjoy.” Still, these signifiers weren’t yet widely understood in terms of queerness – in the 80s, cultural gayness was a novel concept.As hysteria around Aids spread, everything changed. Tabloids stigmatised gay men. Author Matthew Todd details this period extensively in his book Straight Jacket: How to Be Gay and Happy. “They exposed people, hounded them out of their jobs and drove others to suicide,” he tells me. “It’s not surprising that so many pop stars chose to stay in the closet.” This was perhaps when the missing link between queer nightclub pop aesthetics and the act of gay sex finally clicked into place. Prominent members of the disco, Blitz Club and synth-pop movements succumbed to the disease – Sylvester died in 1988, Freddie Mercury in 1991, Leigh Bowery in 1994. Cultural traits for so long naively read as communicators of pop glamour suddenly took on a sinister association.The already fragmented figure of the gay male was further shattered by the epidemic. Aids swung the zeitgeist towards comforting heteronormativity, and so followed the rise of blokey Britpop bands such as Oasis and Blur. Stock, Aitken and Waterman, the songwriting trio who wrote for Divine and were responsible for such 80s gay anthems as Dead or Alive’s You Spin Me Round (Like a Record), started writing for Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan (a man so heterosexual he sued a magazine for claiming he was gay). The underground sound they had ushered into the mainstream gave way to something safer, straighter.The gay male figure, now too threatening to be marketable, vanished from pop and into underground spaces or behind DJ decks. “You could say the greatest gay pop star of the 90s was the nightclub Trade,” says Flynn. Trade was London’s first legal after-hours club, opening in 1990. “It was absolutely drug-addled, topless – it was everything pop music used to be in the 80s, except it was a nightclub.”The gay male figures who did cling to their place in the pop landscape were put through the ringer. George Michael was outed after an incident in a public bathroom, a scandal that tabloids fanned relentlessly – the Sun’s front page read: “Zip me up before you go go”. Boyzone’s Stephen Gately decided to out himself to the Sun. Celebrity outings became a racket for tabloids that knew the jittery public would jump at such headlines.As mainstream pop either disappeared or degraded gay men, many gay male pop consumers resorted largely to “disidentification” with straight female pop stars during the 90s and 00s: the process by which, in the absence of representative role models, queer people claim a piece of culture that is not explicitly queer. “Gay men didn’t love Madonna in Evita because they were interested in Argentinian history,” says Lecklider.Female stars in the 90s and 00s such as Madonna, Mariah and Kylie frequently attributed their success to loyal gay fanbases. In many ways, Stock Aitken Waterman’s pivot to Kylie mirrored a transference of gay consumer energy to new, albeit heavily muted, strains of glamour and camp. The music videos of these stars channeled certain tropes of queer underground nightlife in safe mode (see Madonna’s Vogue). As the queer male bodies of colour that inspired the video struggled against sickness and stigma, their dance moves and aesthetics were lifted clean and plastered on to a heterosexual female canvas. If in the 80s, male queerness was dissociated from the male body, in the 90s it was uncoupled completely. In a post-Aids world, cultural gayness was mediated by proxy.Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears was not only openly gay but sang largely about gay things, to gay people. The band rose through New York’s queer nightlife to hit the UK mainstream but it felt as if they were never attempting to appeal to anyone but their queer peers (the clue’s in the name). Their success came not from the plausible deniability of the 80s, nor from the proxy sexuality of the 90s – but simply from the resonance of their queer vision in a world that was slowly draining of gay panic. When Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax was released, Radio 1 DJ Mike Read pulled it off air when he realised what it was about. By contrast, says critic Ian Wade: “Jake Shears was comfortable on Radio 2 playlists even though his album contained some near-the-knuckle language.”They established the foundations for this decade’s new wave of gay male stars. Olly Alexander was raised on Britney and 90s as, and tries to continue their legacy through his work. Sam Smith is “effectively trading as the gay Adele”, jokes Wade. After much speculation, Frank Ocean came out, saying: “I don’t have any secrets I need kept any more.” It was a far cry from the 90s tabloid treatment. Then there’s Perfume Genius, Sufjan Stevens and, of course, Troye Sivan.Sivan sings about gay sex on Bloom, details Grindr hook-ups on Seventeen and nods to cruising and gay sex clubs in the My My My! video. On Animal, he whispers to his boyfriend: “In time, we’ll build a home for two.” There seems to be no opportunity cost in Troye’s universe, only freedom to be everything at once. There is no uncoupling of queer aesthetics, the sex that underpins them or the love that blossoms from them: everything is symbiotic. If there is one thing that marks Sivan’s reign as something new, it is not his being openly gay, or his singing about gay sex – that would be revisionist. It is, put simply, his wholeness. The figure of the gay male in pop has historically been fragmented, exploited for its aesthetics, cloaked in straightness, buried underground. Sivan does not represent its coming out, but its coming together.This journey doesn’t end with Sivan. To understand where the gay male stands in music, it’s worth looking to cinema. As Liam Taft wrote for i-D magazine, mainstream queer cinema can’t seem to reach maturity because it seems trapped in a perpetual coming of age. Films about gay male lives are becoming more common, but they’ve settled on selling a white adolescent fantasy: take Call Me By Your Name and Love, Simon. The world of Troye Sivan is remarkably similar: young, white and aspirational, selling the twin fantasies of sex club and picket fence. This cultural fixation is such that the New York Times declared that we’ve entered the “age of the twink” (young, skinny, white men). Perhaps this glorification is why young black gay artists like MNEK are failing to sell albums – while some have argued Language is simply not a great pop album, others insist his identity is affecting sales.While the music industry has decided male queerness is again marketable, queer theory teaches that capitalism carved out gender and sexual roles as means of control: categories that queerness is meant to threaten. Market forces motivated tabloid outings in the 90s –\u0026nbspthe outrageous headlines sold papers. They’re similarly behind lists of the “best queer acts to watch” today. Pop music has always been about selling hot young people getting it on, and Sivan represents the queer male finally claiming the right to sell his version of that story. What the queer male must be wary of now is how capitalism proceeds to curate us – the pretty parts it will try to sell, and the other parts it will try to suppress."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing today in focus","story":"Today in Focus is a new daily podcast that brings you closer to  journalism.

With British politics focused on the budget, EU diplomats do not expect talks between the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, to resume this week.Some European officials see a growing risk of sliding into an accidental no-deal, if the British parliament votes down any agreement the embattled prime minister strikes with the EU.EU leaders decided they would not come to a November summit unless there was substantial progress in talks, which are deadlocked over a solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Barnier told EU leaders earlier this month not to expect progress until December, which leaves very little time for UK parliamentary ratification.A UK government spokesperson said: “We want to get a deal as soon as possible and agreed in the autumn. We will continue to work with the EU to make this happen.”Talks remain stuck over the Irish backstop, an insurance plan that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and subject to many single market rules. May has said no prime minister could accept it and the government is searching for alternatives. While EU negotiators have been discussing an all-UK customs union and extension of the transition, EU diplomats insist these cannot be alternatives to an open-ended guarantee on the backstop.Senior EU sources say little progress has been made since March on Ireland, with the British rejecting Barnier’s efforts to “de-dramatise” the issue by moving most customs checks away from the border, into company premises.EU leaders are said to be confident of a deal, but some officials are less sanguine. Several sources have rubbished claims that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will ride to the rescue of the British by watering down the EU position. “Germany has not budged one inch,” a senior EU diplomat said. “The UK has been misreading the German position for years,” the source added, a reference to David Cameron’s misplaced hopes in Berlin on a series of issues.Merkel’s decision to step down as leader of the CDU party, which is seen as weakening her authority, is unlikely to have any impact on Brexit. “The Germans are pretty laid back,” said one diplomat, who predicted it would not change anything.British politicians campaigning for a second referendum, including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, urged Barnier last week to start planning for an extension of the two-year negotiating period, article 50. Khan said whatever deal May brings back would definitely be rejected by parliament.Diplomatic sources say the EU has made no plans for prolonging article 50, while any extension beyond the European elections on 23 May 2019 is deemed legally impossible, unless the UK takes part in the vote.The UK will automatically leave the EU on 29 March 2019 unless all 27 member states agree unanimously to a British request to extend article 50.Lamberts argues that British remainers should accept leaving the EU and campaign for re-entry during the 21-month transition period.He voiced confidence the EU would fast-track the UK’s re-admission. “This is a special case, where you cannot as EU27 demand full re-application,” he said. “If during the transition a popular majority or a political majority in the House of Commons or House of Lords come to the conclusion that the UK should exit the transition by stepping back into the EU I really do not see how, politically, the EU27 could say ‘no thanks’.”Many remain campaigners staunchly oppose this strategy because the UK would lose the rebate and have to renegotiate existing special privileges, such as opt-outs on joining the euro and justice and home affairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe68e9020d2eb1976e159be553bd7e47e2df186/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13a1323410100d5a2b5b1417dd44939","title":"george osborne we got things wrong in run up to eu vote","story":"Ex-chancellor says promise of migration target was undeliverable, and admits fears for Tories’ futureGeorge Osborne has admitted the Conservative government “didn’t spot the shift in politics” that led to the leave vote in the EU referendum, saying it had failed to fix the banking system or explain the positives of immigration or the EU.The former chancellor, who edits the Evening Standard, said his party “did get things wrong” in the run-up to the 2016 vote, including promising a net migration target – of tens of thousands – that could not be delivered.“I think we were wrong to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle,” he told Newsnight. “We were too late in the day trying to explain some of the benefits of European Union membership.”He said David Cameron’s pledge that net migration would be below 100,000 was not possible to deliver and would not be delivered in the future, but suggested that had led to claims that leaving the EU would be the only way to meet the target.“We definitely contributed to that argument. We didn’t make enough of the value of immigration,” he said.Osborne said that argument had then been used by a minority of leave supporters who were convinced by the “rather esoteric issues of constitutional sovereignty”, which had not previously been an issue of major public concern.“We allowed that kind of minority concern – because we pool sovereignty in all sorts of different organisations like Nato – to be linked to immigration control. And that was pretty lethal in that referendum debate,” he said.During the interview, Osborne defended his decision to make £12bn in welfare cuts, though he did not specifically address whether the cuts were too much.“It would be a bit odd to leave out the very large chunk the government was spending on welfare,” he said of his austerity measures.He said Philip Hammond’s budget, in which the chancellor said the era of austerity was coming to an end, was “a perfectly natural end point to the repair job on the public finances”.Osborne said he was deeply concerned about the future of the Conservative party, which he said had fuelled his personal criticism of the prime minister, whom he has previously called “a dead woman walking”.He said: “I worked very hard all my life to make the Conservative party electable. And it’s painful to me to see it losing support in large areas of the country where it shouldn’t be – particularly against a Labour opposition that I don’t think is in a fit state at the moment.”He said his party had won previous elections by being “socially progressive and fiscally conservative” but in the last election had “tried to out-Ukip Ukip” which he blamed for the loss in support.“We ain’t going to win the next election by trying to out-Corbyn Corbyn,” he said of the Labour leader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78e2ba268c3024dc26d3a20fadb1716bdc4fef0f/0_36_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b782fb02c8bd088a39ab673dc0a48db","title":"jeremy corbyn berates theresa may for broken promise budget","story":"Labour leader accuses PM of breaking conference pledge to end austerityJeremy Corbyn has castigated the government for what he called a “broken-promise budget”, using prime minister’s questions to argue that the spending plans brought no benefit to poorer people and would see further cuts to many public services.Theresa May responded by insisting she was delivering on her pledge to end austerity, and mocked the Labour leader over his party’s uncertain position on whether or not to support tax cuts outlined in the budget.Corbyn used all his questions to hammer home the argument that the budget was not the giveaway billed by ministers – he used the phrase broken-promise budget three times – and focused on the impact on services other than the NHS.The Labour leader began by quoting analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ director, Paul Johnson: “‘If I were a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a headteacher, I would struggle to find much to celebrate in the budget. I would be preparing for more difficult years ahead.’ Does the prime minister think that analysis is wrong?”May replied by insisting there was more money for schools and prisons, and hailing the tax cut. She said: “What we have set out in the budget is that austerity is, indeed, ending.”The prime minister then noted the unexpected boost to public finances which, budget calculations say, will pay for the previously-promised increase in NHS funding: “The Rt Hon gentleman used to ask me, what taxes will go up to fund the rise in funding for the NHS? The answer on Monday: it’s fully funded, without putting up taxes.”Corbyn cited a calculation by the IFS that government departments not protected from cuts would see combined real-term reductions of £4.1bn. He said: “The prime minister promised austerity was over. The reality is it was a broken promise budget and she knows it.”Corbyn quoted a parent who said the £400m extra for schools would not be nearly enough to cover shortfalls: “Many schools, including mine, have had to resort to asking students and their parents for funds.”He then noted the decision to not reverse the benefit freeze, asking why money had instead been devoted to a tax cut which, analysis shows, will mainly benefit wealthier households.This prompted May to mock him for Labour’s seemingly wavering view on the tax cuts: “I’m interested that the Rt Hon gentleman chose to raise the issue of tax cuts. On Monday, he said that cutting taxes for 32 million people was frittering money away on ideological tax cuts. Yesterday, the shadow chancellor said Labour would support the tax cuts.”She added: “Perhaps he can tell the house whether he will back the tax cuts and vote for the budget?”Corbyn replied: “The benefit freeze takes £1.5bn from 10 million low and middle-income households. A low-income household with children will be £200 worse off. For them, there is no end to austerity. Labour would have ended the benefit freeze.The Labour leader ended by in turn noting May’s speech when she first entered Downing Street, where she promised to tackle social problems.“The prime minister once claimed to be concerned about burning injustices. Well, that concern has fizzled out, hasn’t it?” he said.“The prime minister pledged to end austerity at her party conference, and the chancellor failed to deliver it in this house. The cuts continue. Those on lower income will be worse off as a result of this budget. Austerity has failed and needs to end now.“So know we know: councils, schools, police, prisons, public sector workers, and those reliant on social security will face years of austerity. Will she apologise for her broken promise that she was going to end austerity? Because she has failed to do that.”This prompted a passionate defence from May on what she said were measures to tackle injustice, including policies on slavery, mental health, and her race disparity audit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/756458944af13b83dff54896b1d2f8fe370590de/0_92_2314_1388/master/2314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edea34b718d009c09756e0a307e1e6b4","title":"why the uks brexit negotiation tactics drew a blank","story":"Whether down to irritation or indifference, efforts to sidestep Brussels’ ‘technocrats’ failedNobody knows when, but the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, is likely to be back soon at the VIP door of the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters and heading up to the fifth floor to meet his EU opposite number, Michel Barnier. Deadlines and crunch summits have been and gone. Now time is running out to make a Brexit deal. So it is back to Brussels.It wasn’t meant to be like this. The UK has been angling for EU leaders to make an offer since the beginning of the Brexit process. Before the Salzburg summit, Theresa May appealed to her counterparts to put themselves in her place, hoping they would understand better than “a technocrat in Brussels”, as one ally told the Financial Times. Over the summer British ministers had toured the continent in a bid to win hearts and minds for the prime minister’s Chequers strategy.The gambit failed. One EU minister even “felt a bit used” by a British ministerial visit judged to be no more than a media hit targeted at British audiences, recounts one diplomat, but that London had become very attentive since the Brexit vote. “In the old days we could hardly get a junior minister to come to speak to us.”Some are more philosophical. “There is a general feeling that they use these visits to reach their home audiences, but probably that is what politicians do everywhere,” another EU diplomat observed.Whether it’s down to irritation or indifference, the British attempt to sidestep the “technocrats” of Brussels has drawn a blank. For many EU observers, the only surprise is how long the UK persisted.“The British side have consumed a lot of goodwill in the way they have handled Brexit,” says Lotta Nymann-Lindegren, until recently Finland’s Brexit attache. She thinks May mishandled the Salzburg summit, a week that ended with the visibly-furious prime minister demanding respect. May would argue she is defending the referendum result, but her address to EU leaders was read as an uncompromising “Chequers or death” ultimatum.“She blamed the EU for everything and criticised everybody and then she wondered that EU leaders were a bit reluctant to help her out,” Nymann-Lindegren said.With the cabinet mutinous over Brexit, EU leaders are glad the politically thankless task of Brexit has been entrusted to Barnier. At the October Brexit summit, the 27 presidents and prime ministers knocked the table in appreciation of the Frenchman. A few days earlier, business leaders gave him a standing ovation.Some diplomats admit they were sceptical when Barnier was named the EU’s Brexit negotiator. Two years in the job, and he has disarmed critics with his courteous and careful public statements, powerpoint slides and diligent travel around 27 national capitals and the European parliament. “He is at the top of his art,” says Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP on the European parliament’s Brexit steering group not given to flatter political rivals.“What creates trust is the fact that Barnier is connecting back to his political masters all the time,” Lamberts says. “That doesn’t mean that he has a GoPro camera on his head during the negotiating sessions … we can trust him.”Barnier’s team, led by the German trade expert Sabine Weyand, has been given huge leeway to strike a deal with London. As talks entered their most intensive phase earlier this month, she told diplomats she needed their trust to go into “the tunnel”, non-stop talks with a news blackout. EU ambassadors were in the dark on details. During long days of talks, sustained by salad and quiche from the commission canteen, Weyand and her opposite number, Olly Robbins, tested out politically-explosive ideas such as extending the transition period. Although their face-to-face talks only resumed on Tuesday, the pair have remained in constant contact.EU insiders say London is mistaken to imagine Angela Merkel or Emmanuel Macron negotiating, say, animal health checks on sheep, in the dead of a November night. Brexit is not seen as an existential threat for the EU, like the eurozone crisis that threatened to bring down the single market, dragging EU leaders into endless summits full of technical smallprint. It is seen as a British problem the EU must live with.Many argue London has consistently misread the EU. “Sometimes the UK debate is very insular,” says Claus Grube, a former Danish ambassador to the UK and EU. The UK debate is “based on ideology and emotions”, for the EU “it is based on taking care of our real interests” he says.The EU’s approach was fixed in the summer of 2016, between the Brexit vote and a summit in Bratislava in September. It was agreed no one outside the club should get the same benefits as members. Gripped by anxiety they would be outfoxed by clever British civil servants, EU officials decided to wait for London to say what it wanted from Brexit. It was a strategy that united the 27 member states, just as the EU was riven by conflict over migration and the rule of law.Not everyone is impressed. The UK’s former ambassador to Brussels, Ivan Rogers, thinks the EU has shown “dangerous complacency on the British question”. In a conscious echo of John Maynard Keynes, who warned of the dangers of a bad peace in 1919, Rogers argues that the EU’s reluctance to go beyond “a smooth technocratic approach” contributes to the risk of both sides sleepwalking into a disastrous no-deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e7545e00c14d55b8874c905a0fb53c892312c2/764_273_1938_1163/master/1938.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=594c849a85c2d17b45f55d9b3f3a60ee","title":"has new ghost subatomic particle manifested at large hadron collider","story":" ‘Something terribly new’ goes bump in data yet to be confirmed by Atlas detectorScientists at the Cern nuclear physics lab near Geneva are investigating whether a bizarre and unexpected new particle popped into existence during experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.Researchers on the machine’s multipurpose Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector have spotted curious bumps in their data that may be the calling card of an unknown particle that has more than twice the mass of a carbon atom.The prospect of such a mysterious particle has baffled physicists as much as it has excited them. At the moment, none of their favoured theories of reality include the particle, though many theorists are now hard at work on models that do.“I’d say theorists are excited and experimentalists are very sceptical,” said Alexandre Nikitenko, a theorist on the CMS team who worked on the data. “As a physicist I must be very critical, but as the author of this analysis I must have some optimism too.”Senior scientists at the lab have scheduled a talk this Thursday at which Nikitenko and his colleague Yotam Soreq will discuss the work. They will describe how they spotted the bumps in CMS data while searching for evidence of a lighter cousin of the Higgs boson, the elusive particle that was discovered at the LHC in 2012.The Large Hadron Collider creates particles by smashing subatomic protons into one another at close to the speed of light. When the protons meet, the energy in the collision is converted into mass, and so particles, in line with Einstein’s equation, Emc2.Many particles created in the LHC are highly unstable and immediately decay into lighter, more stable particles such as photons and electrons. It is by looking for an excess of these particles, apparent as a bump in the data, that physicists tend to find new particles. For example, one way the Higgs boson betrayed its existence was through the unusually high number of photons recorded in collisions in which the particle was made.But particle physics is no easy pursuit. To the endless frustration of its practitioners, bumps in data produced by nothing more than statistical fluctuations pop up all the time. The best way to distinguish between these and Nobel prize-winning discoveries is to analyse more and more data: statistical flukes always vanish with time.In two separate analyses, the CMS team found data that pointed to a build-up of muons, or heavy electrons, in their detector. If real, the data indicates a new particle with a mass of 28GeV or 1 billion electron volts, slightly less than a quarter of the mass of a Higgs boson. Whatever it is, it is not the particle Nikitenko and his colleagues were looking for.To complicate matters further, the bumps were more pronounced in the LHC’s low energy collisions than in more energetic collisions the machine performed after an upgrade. That could be explained, said Nikitenko, if more “background” particles are produced at higher energies that then obscure the signal.Because the analysis is so time-consuming, it could take the CMS team another year to confirm or rule out the existence of a new particle. But Karl Jakobs, spokesperson for the Cern team that works on Atlas, the LHC’s other multipurpose detector, said it was checking its own data for signs of the proposed particle. “We are working on a similar analysis of the Atlas data, however I cannot yet give you a timeline when the results will become public,” he said.For Atlas to cross-check the result was “crucial”, Nikitenko said. “If it is confirmed by Atlas it will be the real thing. It will be really something terribly new.”One independent study has already reported potential evidence for the particle. Arno Heister, a former member of the CMS team who knew about the bumps in the data, analysed older results collected by Aleph, a detector on Cern’s previous particle accelerator known as the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP). He found a similar bump at 30GeV. “This excess, if real, is something very unexpected,” he told the .Georg Weiglein, a theorist on the German Electron-Synchrotron machine (DESY) said it will be hard to come up with a model that has a particle like the one the CMS bump calls for. “This does not exclude the possibility that such a signal could actually exist. On the contrary, it would be even more exciting if a signal were observed that does not seem to fit into our present models,” he said. “Further experimental information is eagerly awaited.”Michelangelo Mangano, a researcher at Cern, said: “Of course theorists are always happy when some anomaly shows up in the data. And I am confident many colleagues have started looking into this. However it is a bit early to get excited.”“Given that Atlas has yet to release their analysis, and given that much more data is on tape even for CMS, it is clear that the effect will soon be confirmed or diluted away,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/963303908db1dba3e9a796987850cf4a780c146e/0_285_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5d7de4eb7b6e19b68460c82aeb3fb0a","title":"stephen hawking phd thesis and wheelchair to sell in online auction christies","story":"Lots include A Brief History of Time signed with thumbprint and Simpsons scriptPersonal items belonging to Stephen Hawking, including his medals and one of his wheelchairs, are to be sold at an online auction.The British physicist, best known for his research on black holes, died in March, aged 76.The auction, hosted by Christie’s, is called On the Shoulders of Giants and features 22 items belonging to Hawking as well as manuscripts by Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein.

She gives mine a gentle squeeze.“Hola,” she greets me softly, but soon turns back to the daytime television that fills the common room. Her husband, Jose, is all smiles and handshakes beneath his black cap advertising Peru, the country of their birth, and observes: “Gladys, she look good and well.”Six months ago, when I first met Gladys and Jose, this was not the case. Gladys has frontotemporal dementia. It is a cruel disease that affects the right and left lobes at the front of the brain. Her mobility is limited and speech is almost non-existent. Unlike Alzheimer’s disease, it affects younger people and, rather than targeting memory loss, it begins with a deterioration of speech and abnormal personality changes. The frontal lobes are where we process what we see and hear, meaning the breakdown of these areas results in changes in mood and behaviour and a progressive deterioration of motor function and cognition. “It is a disease which presents with early behavioural or language changes, as well as other cognitive changes including some memory loss,” says Associate Professor Michael Woodward, an expert in the field.When Jose raised the topic with Gladys he was met with confrontational and aggressive moods, which was out of character. Gladys was a strong, intelligent, open-minded woman whose devotion to her husband and family never wavered. Jose and Gladys had been inseparable since resettling in Australia amid political instability in Peru. Belief in each other is the cornerstone upon which their relationship is founded, and to see that belief erode from Gladys pained Jose. “She accuse me of having the hungry eyes. She say: ‘I see you have the eyes for a woman.’ This make me feel no good, because she not believe in me.”After testing and diagnosis, Gladys’s health deteriorated and the family decided to move her to an aged care facility where she would have immediate access to physical and mental healthcare. Jose would remain her primary carer. Since diagnosis, he has spent every day by her side and only when she drifts off to sleep does he return to the family home. “We do have a number of spouses and relatives who visit daily and support their loved ones but this is quite exceptional. It is the commitment Jose and indeed their children have also shown to supporting Gladys which is a standout for me,” says Darinka Rozanic, the manager at Moran Aged Care, where Gladys lives. “The labelling of photos to help support memories, the enthusiasm displayed for participating in activities and events and in general speaking with Gladys even when she could not. They all see the person, not the disease.”The daily care has meant the family, particularly Jose, sees any change in behaviour or health and can act immediately. In April, Gladys’s shoulders were hunched, her eyes vacant and she slept for much of the day. Six months later, she is upright and living permanently outside the specialised dementia unit. That improvement is a testament to Jose’s dedication to Gladys’s wellbeing.“If she is showing a certain type of behaviour, it’s about having the patience to go through, try this, try that, to find a cause then eliminate that for her,” says Roxana, Jose and Gladys’s daughter. “Six, seven months ago her general wellbeing was very bad. No walking, no movement, no facial expression. Dad noticed that and said: ‘No way. This is not what’s meant to be.’” Jose asked to see a specialist and it was decided to slowly reduce Gladys’s medication. He kept a diary to monitor her progress. Roxana adds: “She is more settled, happier. As long as she is good, we are good. She has taught us so much through this.”Jose says: “My favourite moments now are birthdays. Family birthdays she come back to our house in Epping. She is looking, looking. She is happy. She try to remember. To me, she is looking for memories.” Dementia is a formidable foe for the 436,366 Australians living with the disease. Research has yet to find a cure and positive prognoses are scattered.“There are so many factors in ensuring a person with dementia has good quality of life,” says Belinda Nixon, services operations manager at Dementia Australia. “If you are engaged, if you’ve got support, if you are having your needs met, you are going to be better off. No doubt about it.” Jose is in a fortunate position – he has a supportive family, a facility working with him and access to support networks. Sitting in Gladys’s room, surrounded by images of a life lived before dementia dug in its claws – a family portrait at the beach, birthday candles blown out, smiling grandchildren – I ask why he does all that he does for Gladys. Jose touches his heart and says: “Because she is in here, always. She is in here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb37b7f50bbfb1a19b92afe3d3798a775643f03/0_252_3681_2208/master/3681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d57b456bee040189b25ff493db02da74","title":"delicate days england rugby union november series","story":"With less than 12 months to the World Cup, Eddie Jones’s squad cannot afford to treat autumn Tests as mere sparring sessionsThere are two schools of thought before the November internationals. According to Eddie Jones, the Tests are mere sparring sessions as preparation for next year’s World Cup in Japan. Those who have paid serious money to watch the All Blacks tackle England and Ireland beg to differ, preferring here and now evidence to pie in the sky potential.The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Rare is the northern hemisphere side who drag their feet through the autumn leaves and still go on to conquer the world within 12 months. There is a particularly strong correlation between England’s November form and their World Cup destiny stretching back years.In the autumn before their 2003 triumph, Clive Woodward’s squad dispatched New Zealand, Australia and South Africa on successive Twickenham weekends, scoring almost 39 points per game on average. In 2010 and 2014 they went down to the All Blacks and South Africa and never quite regathered sufficient momentum.Who could possibly argue, too, that Ireland will be no further forward psychologically if they beat New Zealand in Dublin on 17 November or that victory over the Wallabies on Saturday week is irrelevant to Welsh morale? Try telling the respective players of Italy and Georgia, furthermore, that their fixture in Florence on the same day will have nil impact on the debate about Six Nations promotion and relegation. To dismiss any of those encounters as sparring sessions would be insultingly fake news.England, either way, risk straying into punchbag territory if they perform abjectly on the next two Saturdays. Losing to the All Blacks is an occupational hazard but defeat first up at home to a Springboks side shorn of several key iniduals? Nor can the body language and energy levels of Jones’s players after their lengthy warm-weather training camp in the Algarve afford to be downbeat. Start sluggishly and they may find themselves camping in Aldershot next time.England are missing some key men themselves, particularly in the pack but, after five defeats in their past six Tests, there comes a time when all involved need to front up or step aside. In Portugal these past few days there have been some encouraging signs, not least in terms of the players’ collective conditioning. Those still standing look encouragingly fit, if that is not too much of a tautology.Some within the Rugby Football Union are also suggesting there is less pressure on the squad than there might normally be. Give it a good rattle against a physical South Africa and prove competitive against the All Blacks and, if nothing else, Jones will have competition for places when the Vunipolas and others return. The dark clouds, some argue, will only gather in earnest if England contrive to lose either of their final games to Japan or an underperforming Australia.Maybe, but with a trip to Dublin awaiting Jones’s squad on the opening weekend of the 2019 Six Nations, these remain delicate days in terms of English confidence. Recruiting Will Carling as a leadership guru is all very well but, less than a year out from a World Cup, it does not smack of “steady as she goes” serenity. Both Ireland and Wales are ahead of England in the world rankings, with the power to add in the coming weeks. England, even if their results are not flawless, should be performing better and more consistently than they are.The Irish, admittedly, have yet to crack the World Cup code but their showdown with New Zealand will be instructive on both sides. Without the absent Conor Murray at scrum-half will they be quite as formidable or is their Leinster core steely enough to cope? Will Johnny Sexton upstage Beauden Barrett again? It is a clear sign of the times when the Aviva Stadium, rather than Twickenham, is due to stage the month’s most eagerly-anticipated encounter. Having already lost to the Springboks in Wellington last month, the All Blacks may just be heading for another fall.This would also be a good moment for Warren Gatland’s improving Wales and Gregor Townsend’s enterprising Scotland to lay down some significant markers, though precisely where Saturday’s fixture between the teams in Cardiff fits into the equation is debatable. Thankfully the WRU and SRU have jointly pledged to donate a six-figure sum to Doddie Weir’s foundation from the proceeds of the game but arranging to play it outside the Test window on a Pro14 weekend has further highlighted the fault lines within the modern international game.Should an understrength Ireland second team really be playing Italy in Chicago this weekend? Will the RFU be reimbursing those fans who bought tickets fully expecting to see the English-based Faf de Klerk, Willie le Roux and Vincent Koch representing a fully-loaded South Africa? Will stricter high-tackle interpretations lead to 13-a-side contests? Suddenly we are back into the murky world of experimental sparring, as opposed to meaningful occasions.The international game, at its best, is a glorious thing. Those who wilfully cheapen it do so at rugby’s global peril."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a026f74bbaa64cf8d6701231ded5461ce3b3028/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee119773b49ffb16f449532d95a4dbfc","title":"lewis hamilton f1 profile driver social media","story":"Two years into their tenure as the owners of Formula One and Liberty Media have known only one champion. With Lewis Hamilton taking the title in four of the last five years Liberty have inherited a period of singular supremacy by the British driver. Ordinarily this might be cause for concern as they seek to expand the sport but right now they must be positively relieved that if there is to be a dominant star, it is Hamilton.Hamilton and his Mercedes team have been the pre-eminent force in F1 since 2014. They have won every title since then, with only Nico Rosberg’s 2016 victory denying Hamilton a clean sweep. Over the next two races the team are likely to make it five drivers’ and constructors’ championships in a row to match Ferrari’s record achieved with Michael Schumacher between 2000 and 2004.For the last two seasons Hamilton has been pushed hard by Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel but has come out on top. Liberty want to see close, competitive racing with a range of winners but as things stand – a two-horse race between Hamilton and Vettel – they will not be concerned that it is Hamilton who is on top.The 33-year-old, who took his fifth title in Mexico last weekend, is a one-man publicity machine for F1, especially in the US, a market Liberty are eager to expand. In the US Hamilton commands a presence and popularity unmatched by any driver. Even Fernando Alonso, who is well known in North America, does not come close and he is leaving the sport next season.Before the US Grand Prix it was Hamilton who did a Q\u0026ampA at the Nasdaq stock exchange. It was a giant image of the kid from Stevenage who had made it big which was then projected on the building in Times Square. The next day he appeared on Good Morning America.It was only the latest in a series of high-profile appearances after he launched a clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin in Shanghai, Tokyo and New York.It is publicity money cannot buy and stands in stark contrast to his contemporaries. Vettel has no presence on social media. He keeps his private life largely private “I am happy to do things that people think are boring but for me they are not,” he said this year. Within the sport Vettel is an interesting, at times fascinating character, but he may as well be invisible to a wider audience.Behind Vettel stand only Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo as characters who project but rarely outside the F1 bubble, their footprint is negligible compared with Hamilton’s. Worse still, the future holds a number of young drivers who have had all their interesting traits excised with extensive media training.Hamilton may be isive but he is always fascinating, presenting the big picture Liberty want their sport to embrace, as former driver John Watson observed. “What Lewis is doing is something we have never seen before from a motor racing personality,” he said. “Many people find it uncomfortable. As far as I am concerned he is opening a different world, a different market to his sport and trying to draw in people from entirely different backgrounds, education, colours, creeds, whatever, to look.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcf74cbd1088da4d6df0855735f490eadaa4a018/191_282_2155_1293/master/2155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50e46163cf090f80106001c1e1b893f5","title":"dealing with clair review martin crimp","story":"Orange Tree theatre, RichmondThis revival gains an eerie topicality, yet its ingenious study of moneyed hypocrisy makes it truly timelessBy an extraordinary quirk of fate, Martin Crimp’s 1988 play is being revived at the very moment the unsolved murder of Suzy Lamplugh is once again headline news. While Crimp’s play touches on the theme of an estate agent who mysteriously disappears, its topicality shines through in countless other ways: it is, ultimately, about the moral equivocation of the middle classes, and men’s abuse and belittlement of women.Property lies at the heart of the artfully told story. Mike and Liz are a yuppie couple anxious to get the maximum price for their London house. So, although they have already accepted an offer, they are open to a higher cash bid from an enigmatic picture-dealer named James. Clair is the estate agent caught in the middle, who becomes the excuse for the couple’s double-dealing and an object of unhealthy curiosity on the part of the creepily intrusive James.What Crimp is brilliant at, in a way of which Pinter or Mamet would approve, is showing how language can camouflage people’s baser actions. Mike and Liz epitomise bourgeois lies and evasions, dubbing the au pair’s windowless attic “the guest room” and saying of the initial house offer that “legally it means nothing”. But Crimp also skilfully suggests the same tactic is applied to sex. Mike conceals his fascination with Clair by patronisingly calling her “the waitress”, while James weaves his way into her life by suggesting they have a shared solitude.Even if the final scene strikes me as superfluous, it is a fiendishly clever play, excellently directed by Richard Twyman in a co-production with English Touring Theatre.Fly Davis’s set, a rectangular box with gauze walls, adds to the sense of strangeness and the performances are perfectly in key. Michael Gould is wholly plausible as the spidery cash buyer and Lizzy Watts as Clair suggests a fly caught in his web. Tom Mothersdale and Hara Yannas bring out the smooth-faced greed of the vendors who treat Roseanna Frascona’s Italian nanny as an extension of their property. Although written 30 years ago, it is rivetingly a play for today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a770ae2e05c2458f51d39e0a5d85aa83ecade74b/0_478_3924_2354/master/3924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e5698c7dc3c82102ae5d281b3644fea","title":"apple launches new macbook air retina display","story":"Fan favourite updated with Touch ID and new keyboard and launched alongside new Mac MiniApple has finally updated its most popular laptop, the MacBook Air, with retina display and Touch ID fingerprint sensor.The new lower-cost Apple notebook adopts many of the technologies Apple introduced with the MacBook Pro in 2016, including a large Force Touch trackpad, new keyboard and two Thunderbolt 3 ports in the side for power and connectivity.It ships with eighth-generation dual-core Core i5 processor along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, costing £1,199 ($1,199 in the US), undercutting both the smaller 12in MacBook and the cheapest MacBook Pro in cost.The once-popular MacBook Air was last updated in early 2015 with Intel’s fifth-generation Core chips and graphics. Things have moved on greatly since 2015 with Intel’s latest eight-generation chips providing not only significantly increased processing power shifting to a quad-core configuration, but also longer battery life thanks to improved efficiency.For many, the £1,249 12in MacBook, which uses Intel’s Y-series ultra-low power chips, has not been a suitable replacement, while the 13in MacBook Pro without a touch bar, which is also £1,249, has been too expensive. That has left users and businesses hanging on to old machines for longer than expected. Applewill hope they jump to purchase the new MacBook Air.Apple also updated its smallest desktop computer, the Mac Mini, which was last updated in 2014. It now has eighth-generation Intel quad and six-core Core processors, up to 64GB of RAM and SSDs.

The body is aluminium and glass, rather than having stainless steel sides, which makes it a little less slippery and easier to grip.Despite being well made, it feels less luxurious than the iPhone XS or previous all-metal iPhones, but given most will put it in a case I suspect it won’t make much difference. It’s worth noting that Apple is not making cases for the iPhone XR, meaning third-party manufacturers are your only option.The iPhone XR comes in a large range of colours. It looks stunning in the red or white colours, but a little cheap in the yellow option. The increased screen size and larger bezels makes it 4.5mm wider than the iPhone XS, but 1.7mm narrower than the iPhone XS Max, which with its rounded edges makes the iPhone XR right on the limit of what I am able to use one-handed. Those with smaller hands will struggle. The iPhone XR is also wider than rivals such as the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro, 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ or the 6.4in Huawei Mate 20 Pro.The iPhone XR has the same A12 Bionic chip as the iPhone XS and XS Max, but has only 3GB of RAM compared to 4GB for the more expensive models.Day-to-day performance is indistinguishable between the new iPhones: iOS feels snappy and fluid, while gaming performance was similar too. There will be times where the iPhone XR will have worse performance because of the smaller amount of RAM, perhaps during heavy multitasking, but I couldn’t find any in real world usage.Battery life on the other hand is all-round better than both the iPhone XS and XS Max, which lasted 24 and 27 hours respectively. The iPhone XR lasted over 32 hours between charges, matching last year’s iPhone X, meaning it would make it from a 7am wake up alarm until around 3pm the next day.That was while using it as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone XR also technically has a slower 4G modem than the iPhone XS, but given that in real-world usage the limit on speed is not with the phone but the 4G provider, it is unlikely to make any difference.The iPhone XR runs iOS 12 and is identical to the iPhone XS, complete with grouped notification handling and integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.The lack of 3D touch means some of it works a little differently. To quick reply to a notification from lock screen you have to swipe left on it, select view, then reply, rather than just press harder on it.Other tasks such as launching the camera from the lock screen are now activated by long-presses rather than hard-presses, but shortcuts from apps such as direct access to the selfie camera or a quick preview of the next event in your calendar are not supported.The truth is I’ve never really used 3D touch gestures apart from the one to clear all notifications or for quick replies, so I didn’t miss them.The iPhone XR has one-half of the iPhone XS’s camera, having the same 12-megapixel wide angle camera but not the 2x telephoto camera.The result is a camera that captures very similar-looking standard photos to the excellent iPhone XS, with excellent dynamic range, colour and detail, and good low-light performance. In fact it’s not until you try to zoom in that you can really tell the difference. The 5x digital zoom is still surprisingly good, but it isn’t a patch on the hybrid zoom produced by the dual-camera system.Likewise, portrait shots of people are good with a much wider angle than that produced by the iPhone XS, but you have to get closer to your target for the face detection to work properly and produce the effect. You’re also limited to shooting people and it lacks some of the more advanced lighting effects.The selfie camera is identical to that on the iPhone XS, producing good but not overly detail-rich selfies.Overall, the cameras on the iPhone XR are really good and a massive step up on the iPhone 7 or older, but not the best available on a smartphone.The iPhone XR is available in black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red, costing £749 with 64GB of storage, £799 with 128GB and £899 with 256GB.The iPhone XR is an odd proposition. For many it will be the most attractive iPhone just because it is £250 cheaper than the iPhone XS, but it’s important to note that at £749 it is in no way cheap.Many top-end rivals cost around the £750 mark while offering better screens, better cameras and more capabilities – and some even undercut it by as much as £250.But for the Apple-only buyer, what you get with the iPhone XR is most of what makes the iPhone XS good, just not the bits that make it truly great. It doesn’t feel as luxurious, the bezels are larger and the screen isn’t as nice, the camera isn’t quite as capable and it isn’t the best iPhone you can buy, which undoubtedly is some of the appeal of a £999 smartphone.The iPhone XR does last longer than the other 2018 iPhones, and it comes in some stunning colour options. If you must buy an iPhone but can’t or won’t spend £999 or more, the iPhone XR is the smartphone for you.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

There are reports of skeletal remains of a woman, man and child found in separate incidents between the 1880s and 1900s, as well as the story of the shipwrecked sailor who spent a night in the house one Christmas and had to fight off a monster with an axe. The house can be visited for free anytime – and if you’re feeling brave, the gatehouse is now run as a camping pod by Shetland Amenity Trust (£12pp, sleeps 8, Mar-Oct).CharlotteStaff and visitors at Woodhorn Museum have reported many spinechilling sightings across the museum and Victorian colliery heritage site. One strange sighting is the mysterious Man in a Leather Apron. This intimidating figure has been mistaken for a rather eccentric costumed interpreter, but the museum doesn’t use costumed interpreters, and despite many sightings, the man has never been caught on camera.

It is on two cliffs bridged by a narrow backbone of rock with awesome views in all directions. Peeping through empty stone window frames past the seabirds circling below, it is hard not to consider the stormy night in 1639 when the cooks tumbled to their deaths as the ocean gobbled up the castle’s kitchens or to imagine, over the wind and surf, the screaming of 1,300 sailors of the Spanish Armada as the sea smashed the galley Girona to pieces against the Port-Na Spaniagh cliffs on 26 October 1588, swallowing all but nine souls (who were received by chief Sorley Boy MacDonnell and sent to Scotland).MarkOne of the most beautiful hostelries in Kent, the 14th-century Star and Eagle in Goudhurst has long been haunted by a mysterious invisible dog – so much so that the owners no longer put guests in the particular room that it seems to inhabit. Previous occupants report hearing a dog whining, snuffling and scratching throughout the night, stopping them sleeping. Strangely for a dog, it shows little interest in the ground-floor pub or restaurant – but we had it direct from the owners that it’s been quite a problem in the upstairs rooms and that an array of doggy treats and rawhide chews have so far failed to placate it.Ros KaziThe Prospect of Whitby in Wapping (built around 1520 close to the infamous Execution Dock), is said to be haunted by the ghosts of Mary Frith (AKA Moll Cutpurse) and the cruel Judge John Jeffreys. Frith was a larger-than-life virago, crossdresser, pickpocket and madame in 17th century London, and the subject of a play (The Roaring Girl). Jeffreys often drank in the Prospect, which was his local he died in 1689 while incarcerated at the nearby Tower of London, after being identified by a former victim in another Wapping pub. The Prospect was once known as the Devil’s Tavern because of its gruesome reputation. There are amazing views over the river and a noose hangs outside, commemorating Jeffreys’ grisly deeds. CarolineThe ruins of an old priory sit near the A41M5 Junction 1 roundabout, in West Bromwich. They are occupied by the ghost of an old nun. She presents herself as a hitchhiker and gets into the back seats of cars. She says she is trying to find her sister and asks to be driven to the Heath Lane cemetery. Drivers say their cars immediately become very cold. When they look in their rear view mirror they cannot see her reflection. She lets out a shriek and vanishes. Drivers often experience mechanical trouble at the roundabout. But it’s not an ideal place to break down.Ranjeev KumarThe stark silhouette of Winter’s Gibbet is an arresting ersion on the lonely climb from Elsdon to the summit of Steng Cross in Redesdale. A deserted and windblown place today, the route was once a busy cross-border drove road. It was here, in 1791, that William Winter’s corpse was left to rot in a gibbet cage following his execution, along with two female accomplices, for the murder of a local woman, Margaret Crozier. Winter’s ghost is reputed to roam the moorland, eternally tied to the place of his crime and the monument dedicated to his disgrace.LeanneTamworth Castle, despite being next to a shopping centre, can be quite eerie at night and offers ghost hunts. Not that I believe in that stuff. The two main ghosts are the Black Lady, a ninth-century nun called Editha who had been expelled and was first seen as a ghost in the 12th century, and the White Lady, who was killed by a knight with whom she had fallen in love.

Then there’s my personal experience at the age of 16, when with two friends I was exploring an abandoned racehorse yard. It was night. We had finished exploring and were heading back down the tree-lined driveway towards the hole in the fence that we’d come in through when, 50 metres ahead, a lady in a long white dress appeared then suddenly vanished.

The story behind it is a little less creepy, however: the museum was created in 1979 by local potter Chez Gallip. A friend of his, saddened by having to move away, was given a lock of hair by a female friend to remember her by. Since then, women visiting from around the world have added to the collection (and donating now forms part of a competition to win a holiday in Cappadocia, including participating in Chez’s pottery workshops).• chezgalipIn the 400-year-old walled city of Gruyères, at medieval Château St Germain, visitors can step inside the dark creative mind of Swiss artist HR Giger.

Well, Ruby strode. Kim-Joy walked, and Rahul looked like he was being escorted by an invisible guard towards a burning stake and felt it no more than he deserved. It is his way. While all are worthy finalists, it is Rahul who has probably garnered the most attention and emotional investment over the weeks. There are those who saw his unremitting gloom, his certainty of failure and permanent air of doomy anxiety as a pose or a ploy. The rest of us simply saw ourselves.When he noted after being made star baker that “As soon as something good happens, something bad comes behind it”, we nodded. When he told the camera at the end of a bad week with Scananian bakes “I don’t deserve to be here any more”, we felt represented. From now on, when we stare into the abyss we can see Rahul staring back and describing his prevailing mood as “very dooming”.But who could begrudge magnificent Ruby a win? She eats pain for breakfast and only gets stronger with every mouthful. Or Kim-Joy who will ice you a wonderland and stuff your mouth with golden toffee crackle through her laughter and her tears?The customary opener, the signature bake, was a dozen doughnuts – six ring, six filled. Kim-Joy got busy with an amaretto diplomat filling and tiny bee decorations. Ruby went hell for leather with two different flavoured doughs and a piping bagful of dulce de leche. And Rahul – has never had a doughnut. He went for a mango crème patisserie filling (his piping bag burst) and buttercream flowers atop the rings “to make them look like wreaths.” It was all very Rahul and never more so than at the end when they were, against the odds and his fervent belief, pronounced delicious.The technical was flatbreads over an open fire, which was – excuse me while I dip into professional jargon for a moment, but needs must – a really stupid idea that tested only contestants’ camping skills and I will be registering a complaint with the Paul Hollywood ombudsman later today, but at least it got Kim-Joy her first technical win of the series.Then the showstopper – which Rahul did have to stop with because in the heat of the tent one of his storage jars exploded. Just his. No one else’s. I suspect, because I carry Rahul in my heart, that in some deep way this soothed him. Pessimists are always relieved when disaster finally strikes. It’s the closest we get to happiness. He tidied up while the other two participants got on with creating their magical landscape desserts (choux mountains, passionfruit sponge hills, pistachio unicorns and praline dust paths for our Ruby, the lost city of Atlantis in gingerbread for Kim-Joy), and had extra time added for his bake – a 200-piece recreation of a Victorian garden - at the end.And… he won. He probably still, three months after filming ended, doesn’t believe it but we do. The man who came from Kolkata to study for his PhD here seven years ago and began baking at the suggestion of his surrogate family here (“Look,” says his ‘dad’ pointing at a childhood photo of Rahul, “You’re not even smiling then!”) as a way to meet people and make friends is handed the trophy. And you realise that a world in which he wasn’t would have felt very dooming indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2824e2c8614ee0cedf6b51a2ca5f696504896671/502_0_7435_4463/master/7435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=814057332c4897b1fc19738ff69231f7","title":"the bi life is this the first queer friendly dating show","story":"While Love Island has become a big hit, its format is rigid and doesn’t allow for same-sex relationships. E!’s new show could be the answerAlong with the blistering heat and the glimmer of World Cup glory, the overriding theme of the summer was just how invested the nation became in one Spanish villa. Love Island was the sleeper hit turned national phenomenon, with even peripheral player Hayley Hughes briefly steering the nation’s Brexit conversation.In reality, though, it proved a slightly different proposition. A group of young single people have been dispatched to Barcelona in the company of ShaneCourtney. So far, so Jack and Dani. However, they’re not dating each other but meeting with others outside of their circle. Plus, they’re all bisexual. Oh, and there’s no prize money, because, really, there’s no game to play here. Rather, it’s all about exploring who you are and finding people to click with, no matter what your circumstances might be.International swimmer Michael has never had time for a relationship but is keen to get to know people of both genders. Daisie found out her ex had a secret family, and is trying to work through her understandable trust issues. Matt had his most serious relationship with a girl, but is open to dating men, too. The emphasis here isn’t on challenges or rivalries – instead the group support one another as they embark on new, nerve-wracking experiences. For Michael, that means going on his first-ever date, while for more confident Ryan, that means meeting a girl who thinks that the Sangria Familia is a famous Spanish landmark.Lacking a scripted-reality feel (bar an argument between Daisie and her date Adam where you could practically here the director shout ‘cut!’) the Bi Life’s more naturalistic mood puts it closer to something like First Dates. As such, it’s the perfect environment for the group to explain bisexuality both to each other, and to the audience at home. The Bisexual presented a fleshed out representation of bisexual life in London, and The Bi Life is adding to the bi canon.These aren’t the sort of conversations you tend to see on a reality show, let alone one focused around dating. When Daisie’s date admits that bisexuality isn’t for him but a threesome with two girls would be quite alright, it’s a microcosm of how being bisexual is often trivialised – and sexualised – in popular culture. Meanwhile, Mariella admits that lots of people read her as straight in her day to day life, unless, of course, she’s at a gay club. And the girls all admit they don’t know anything out bisexual men, or why a stigma surrounds them.The Bi Life isn’t perfect. Hopefully as it continues, we’ll learn more about the group, and they’ll become closer with one another – right now they have the kind of quickly formed closeness of people on an 18-30 tour which, to be fair, they sort of are. Besides, we need some love triangles for this to be thrilling as well as gamechanging. My money is already on the guy with the tombstone-like veneers that Michael was flirting with in the trailer coming in and causing a storm. The idea is for the housemates to date outsiders but, of course, if two members of the group took a shine to each other and paired off? In a show that’s all about challenging stale norms, it seems the possibilities are endless.The Bi Life continues Thursdays 9pm on E!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3d71cafab20fd8fed48b6bab483aa71d8804ff/0_1_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=779aecc191f1e65941fcc810f910214b","title":"kanye west says hes distancing himself from politics my eyes are wide open","story":"The statement likely results from a falling out between the rapper and a rightwing provocateur over the ‘Blexit’ conceptIs the strangest political marriage in America finally over?Rapper Kanye West, who earlier this month hugged Donald Trump in the Oval Office, declared on Tuesday that he had been “used to spread messages I don’t believe in” and would now be “distancing” himself from politics.The statement is likely to come as a blow to the US president, who has touted West as a prominent black supporter even as his approval rating among African Americans barely touches double figures.West’s primary falling out appears to be not with Trump but Candace Owens, a rising star of the right who was lavished with praise by the president at a gathering of young black conservatives at the White House last week.On Twitter on Tuesday, West said he supports prison reform, commonsense gun laws and compassion for people seeking asylum, then denied that he had designed a logo for a branding exercise known as “Blexit”, which urges African Americans to leave the Democratic party. The concept, originated by Owens, claimed that West had designed the group’s merchandise.“I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine,” West wrote. “I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it.”Evidently stung by the experience, he then followed up: “My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!”She added: “#BLEXIT is about the beautiful stories of so many black people who have awakened themselves to the possibilities of our future, as Americans. The press is trying to use Kanye’s name to create drama and further isiveness which is WRONG.”Owens, who grew up in a Democratic household, is now a fierce critic of the party. In one Twitter post, she says: “There is no group in America that has been more lied to, more abused, or more taken advantage of by the Democrats than black people.”During his bizarre visit to the White House recently, West commented: “You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat. I’ve had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat.”In a rambling monologue that silenced even Trump, the rapper, sporting a “Make America Great Again” cap, told him: “It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That’s my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape.”West has faced widespread criticism for such comments and for his endorsement of a president who critics accuse of emboldening a movement of white nationalism through his words and deeds. The star has made baffling comments about abolishing the 13th amendment and slavery being a choice.Journalist Alex Wagner tweeted in response to West’s announcement: “Apparently Kanye did not understand that “sitting in the Oval Office with the president of the United States and railing against liberals” would be seen as explicitly, uhm, political. But please (for real) go back to creative pursuits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

Subsequently, coalition air strikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen,” Pompeo said.“Substantive consultations under the UN special envoy must commence this November in a third country to implement confidence-building measures to address the underlying issues of the conflict, the demilitarization of borders, and the concentration of all large weapons under international observation,” the secretary of state added.Pompeo did not name the venue for the talks, but Mattis said it would be Sweden. The fact that the secretary of state issued a late-night statement shortly after the defence secretary, with fewer details, raised the possibility that Mattis had not coordinated his disclosures with others in the administration.Talks planned in Geneva in September failed to take place, as Houthi representatives refused to attend without guarantees of safe passage for their wounded soldiers. The two sides have not held talks for two years.The three-year conflict has taken more than 10,000 lives and efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to strangle the economy in Houthi-run areas threaten to help trigger a famine, which the UN says could be the worst the world has seen for a hundred years.“Thirty days from now, we want to see everybody around a peace table, based on a ceasefire, based on a pullback from the border,” Mattis said during an appearance at the US Institute of Peace. “That will allow the special envoy, Martin Griffiths, who is very good, who knows what he’s doing, to get them together in Sweden. That is the only way we are going to solve this.”Since the failure to hold talks in September, Griffiths has unveiled a new peace plan built on confidence-building measures including reopening the airport in the capital, Sana’a, prisoner swaps and payment of civil service salaries.The former head of US disaster relief assistance, Jeremy Konyndyk, suggested the administration was beginning to panic about what could happen in Yemen, and the growing congressional opposition to US backing for the Saudi coalition, especially after the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.“UN envoy Martin Griffiths was in DC last week and his briefings must have turned some heads within the administration. They’re moved quickly to give him some running room,” Konyndyk said in a series of tweets. “No administration wants a famine on its watch – and particularly one that would be so closely tied to the White House’s Saudi policy.”David Miliband, chairman of the International Rescue Committee and former UK foreign secretary called on other security council members to back what may lead to the most significant breakthrough in four years. He said “the UK and other members of the UN security council should be ashamed at their silence in backing the US move”.Burt told MPs on Tuesday that the UN envoy, Griffiths, opposed a UN resolution on Yemen being presented, but it is understood that Griffiths would support a resolution being tabled within weeks, around the time he is due to brief the UN.Diplomats are reluctant to draw the connection in public, but acknowledge Saudi Arabia has been weakened by its role in the murder of the Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, and so is newly vulnerable to western pressure to conciliate in Yemen.The US defence secretary did not say what action the US administration would take if the warring parties did not agree a ceasefire or attend the talks. The US, along with the UK and France, supplies most of the coalition’s weaponry, but has refused to curb the flow of arms in the face of high numbers of civilian casualties and the coalition’s use of blockades and other economic measures to cut off Houthi areas, where most of the population lives, from basic supplies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3681402.1540978921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"george osborne we made mistakes before brexit vote","story":"Appearing on BBC’s Newsnight, former Conservative UK chancellor George Osborne said that mistakes were made by his party in the run-up to the Brexit vote. Video: BBCNewsnight Former UK chancellor George Osborne has said mistakes by the British government during his time in office “opened up the door” in the EU referendum.Appearing on BBC’s Newsnight on Tuesday, Mr Osborne admitted the Conservative Party “did get things wrong” in the lead-up to the Brexit vote.Remain supporters had been “too late in the day” in explaining the benefits of EU membership, he said, while not enough had been made of the value of immigration.He told the programme: “I think we were wrong to play into the debate that everything that Brussels did was a challenge and a battle and was wrong.“On immigration we were promising targets that we couldn’t deliver and that then led to a debate about how you might deliver those targets . . . we definitely contributed to that argument.”He added: “It opened up the door in the referendum . . . essentially it allowed in the referendum, a minority of people who were interested in rather esoteric issues of sort of constitutional sovereignty.“We allowed that kind of minority concern of constitutional sovereignty to be linked to immigration control and that was pretty lethal in that referendum debate.”But Mr Osborne, who is now the editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper, said he had worked hard “in the national interest” during his time in office in the face of a hung parliament and faced with the “gigantic financial crash”.“Ultimately the country grew and jobs were created and we avoided the calamitous situation that a lot of European countries found themselves in this period,” he said. –

us champions trade aid race invest africa","story":"The new US embassy in LondonAmerica looks set to unveil a new trade-oriented Africa policy which will champion US corporate investment over conventional development aid.The move reflects concern in Washington that the west risks being outgunned by China in terms of direct investment on the rapidly developing continent.While the US remains the single biggest investor in Africa by some margin, China is catching up fast has become dominant in the area of large scale infrastructure.London and Paris, with which Washington is working closely, have both said they will increase direct investment in Africa in recent months.Speaking in London, Mr Tibor Nagy, the newly appointed US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said he had become frustrated with the way some African countries had become dependent on aid and that US policy would now seek to promote a “journey to self reliance”.“There is not enough development money in the world to lead Africa to development but there is certainly enough foreign direct investment to do the same thing”, he said.President Donald Trump recently approved the Better Utilisation of Investments Leading to Development Act (Build), legislation that will double, to $60 billion, funds for promoting US corporate investment in Africa.Following China\u0027s lead, the Act will also enable a newly created US government agency to take a direct equity stake of its own in development projects in Africa for the first time.Defusing the \u0026#039demographic timebomb\u0026#039 | Global population issuesCritics say that while the move is welcome the sums involved are not enough and are still dwarfed by new Chinese investment planned for Africa.Mr Nagy, an old Africa hand whose triplets were the first to be born in Zimbabwe after its independence in 1980, said the next 30 years would be pivotal for Africa as its population was set to nearly double to 2.5 billion by 2050.“There will be millions and millions of young people”, he said.Addressing the challenge posed by China in Africa, Mr Nagy said it would be wrong to cast it in the same good-guy-bad-guy light that characterised much western investment there during the cold war investment that fueled conflict and sowed the seeds of continent’s later debt crisis.“I certainly can’t blame African states that there are so many Chinese companies involved there”, he said. “When there was a knock on the door and they opened it, it was only the Chinese that were standing there.“I’d like to make sure that the next time there is a knock on the door it is more than the Chinese standing there… I would like to see US companies standing there.”Nevertheless, Mr Nagy said China’s lending to Africa could threaten a new debt trap one that could result in countries having to surrender strategic assets such as ports and airports to China unless they were able to keep up repayments.He also made clear the US would not hide its light under a bushel when it came to promoting the merits of US corporate investment over Chinese competition in Africa.“Our companies maintain different standards”, he said, “different labour standards, different environmental standards.“The trees don\u0027t disappear.

She never returned.Investigators have not ruled out that the cases could be connected.It is not the first time Italian police have followed a possible lead to finding Orlandi\u0027s body.In 2012, forensic experts exhuming the tomb of a notorious local crime boss at a Vatican church uncovered some 400 boxes of bones.Enrico De Pedis, head of the Magliana gang, was suspected of involvement in her kidnapping and some speculated the youngster may be buried alongside him - although DNA tests failed to find a match.Sightings of the teenager over the years proved unfounded. She would now be 50 years old.The first investigation into Orlandi\u0027s disappearance was closed in 1997.In 2007, De Pedis\u0027 lover told investigators he had kidnapped and killed the girl on the order of the head of the Vatican bank.The claim - that she saw the girl\u0027s body buried in a sack under cement - sparked a fresh enquiry that led nowhere.Police shut the probe again in 2016, after which Pietro Orlando called on the Vatican to open its own investigation.Truth and justice are sacrosanct. We will never give up, he told the media on the last anniversary of her disappearance.Vatican City and Holy SeeJamal Khashoggi was strangled and then dismembered, Turkish prosecutor says An Iron Curtain of social views is still evident in Europe, poll showsBrexit latest: David Davis claims Parliament will vote for Brexit deal because \u0026#39terror will win\u0026#39France expands probe into more baby deformations as investigation explores link to pesticidesComment: A \u0026#39Global Britain\u0026#39 can only exist with immigration.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

And it adds new features, like the Apple Watch charging, which will not work on any third-party chargers.Apple also said it would be able to charge up the AirPod wireless earphone, using a special new case. That also did not arrive at the event.The AirPower\u0027s\u0026nbspstandout feature is that it is able to charge three different products at once, using a wide variety of charging technology. And those products can be placed absolutely anywhere on the wide mat.It is thought to be that complicated system that has taken Apple so long to develop.Apple is rumoured to be potentially holding another event next month. But it is expected to unveil new iPads\u0026nbspand Macs at that launch, making it unlikely that the iPhone accessory is being saved until then.This article was originally published in September, after Apple\u0027s iPhone event. It has been updated and re-published, after the October event passed without any mention of AirPower at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is available to order now ahead of a release date on 7 November.Alongside the MacBook Air came a new Mac Pro, which benefits from the same recycled metals, a new look, and vastly upgraded internals. Both the Mac Mini and the MacBook Air have been neglected for years, with so little attention that some feared it was more likely they would be killed off than refreshed.The iPad Pro came with a similarly radical redesign, which removes the home button from the bottom and almost entirely gets rid of the bezel that has traditionally wrapped around the sides of the screen. That also meant Apple brought a\u0026nbspnew way\u0026nbspof unlocking it, with the introduction of Apple\u0027s Face ID facial recognition technology into the tablet for the first time ever.Apple removed the Lightning port on the bottom of the iPad, and swapped it for USB-C. That has been used on some of Apple\u0027s laptops, but will mean that owners will no longer be able to charge their iPad and iPhone with the same cable.iPad ProApple also introduced an upgraded version of the Apple Pencil, which was first introduced with the first iPad Pro. It now charges by clicking onto the top of the tablet, and features a button on the side that can be press for extra controls.Alongside that came a new look for the Smart Keyboard that is sold alongside the iPad Pro.The new iPad\u0026nbspPro comes in two sizes: an 11-inch version, which because of the smaller bezel takes up the same space as the previous 10.5-inch one, and a bigger 12.9-inch size.The smaller one starts at $769 and the bigger\u0026nbspat\u0026nbsp$969. Both are available to order now and will also go on sale on 7 November.Below is our live blog from the event, detailing Apple\u0027s announcements as they happened.Apple is holding its October event in New York this year. Leaving California is a strange decision, especially when the company relatively recently opened the Steve Jobs Theater that was built specifically for this kind of launch. But it\u0027s probably doing so because of the venue: the Brooklyn Academy of Music. That has a beautiful, old theatre, and is presumably part of an effort to emphasise creativity that is also in keeping with the iPad Pro and the unique Apple-themed invites that were created for each invitee.\u0026nbspTo add to the weirdness, the timings are all a little strange. In part that\u0027s because of the location – the timezone means that everything will be happening earlier than usual, when it\u0027s held on the West Coast – but also because the US is still in summer time when the UK isn\u0027t, meaning the gap is only four hours compared to the usual five.The Apple Store is DOWN, so you can\u0027t buy anything new even if you wanted to. (That includes the brand new iPhones.)\u0026nbspIt used to be said that Apple had to do this, because its ancient back-end meant that it couldn\u0027t put new products up on the shop without taking it down entirely. But the site got a redesign relatively recently and you would have thought that would have been fixed.\u0026nbspSo now it\u0027s not clear why it happens, but it does, every single time. Do they just want to build anticipation ahead of the event? Does it still need all that time to be fixed up instead? Or are they being nice, making sure that people don\u0027t buy products that are just about to be overtaken by something new?Here\u0027s some more detail on the Brooklyn Academy of Music, from the Ibrahim Salha, the Independent\u0027s head of audience and former New Yorker:\u0026nbspI\u0027m a former BAM member, and I think Apple have done brilliantly in choosing the venue for their latest event. It\u0027s a stunning space, as Andrew points out, and will make for quite a departure from the usual announcement live streams we tune in to. Depending on how long the event lasts, attendees can nip in to one of the movie theatres and watch A Star Is Born, or go for a wander around Brooklyn. I recommend the Cesar\u0027s Empanadas food truck – worth waiting in line for.Apple will be livestreaming the event, of course. And you can find that here.Sorry, I was wrong: not just\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspApple logo. A whole big selection of them, presumably from the same pool that Apple used to send out unique invites to all of the attendees today.\u0026nbspSome of them are actually pretty nice and oddly satisfying. So maybe you do want to fire up the live stream now, despite there being another seven minutes to go.

Ruby and Kim-Joy tried their hardest, keeping cool heads throughout, but neither had quite the culinary flair of the winning baking wizard.The Independent live-blogged along with the episode, which you can read below. Before that, here are the five biggest talking points from the episode.While he may have eventually created a stunning showstopper (made to look like a rock garden), Rahul\u0027s final bake got off to a horrific start: a glass jar exploded at his workstation because of the heat, contaminating his ingredients and meaning he had to start all over again. Luckily, Paul and\u0026nbspPrue\u0026nbspoffered\u0026nbsphim an extra 15 minutes to complete the 200 components required to make the showstopper. Talk about pushing yourself.\u0026nbspBake Off final review: Rahul joins an illustrious list of bakersFor apparently the first time in Bake Off history, the finalists\u0027 technical challenge did not take place in the tent, but outside. Under the blazing summer sun, the trio made pitta bread. And under the blazing summer sun, they all struggled, particularly Rahul who didn\u0027t quite understand how to manage the fire. When Kim-Joy came out the winner of the technical challenge, she seemed a sure-fire hit to take home the winner\u0027s trophy. Of course, her Atlantis-inspired showstopper couldn\u0027t top Rahul\u0027s (with Paul calling her\u0027s slightly flat).Ruby, what happened?Ruby came into the final a firm favourite to win, having astonished the judges by taking home Star Baker the previous two weeks. However, an unfortunate tasting doughnut to start the final, following by\u0026nbsplast\u0026nbspplace in the technical, and Ruby was at the bottom of the pack. On the plus side, if any of\u0026nbspthese finalists are to become\u0026nbspa media personality in the near future, it\u0027ll no doubt be the charming Ruby.Yes, we\u0027ve spoken about Rahul\u0027s disastrous smashed glass incident, and his inability to keep a fire going. But lest we forget that the eventual winner also managed to burst his icing bag while filling up a doughnut, leaving behind a fruity mess. It\u0027s bewildering that Rahul has managed to look after himself in the real world at this point.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

There are tears galore on screen, and occasionally even some at home. Perhaps the most heart-wrenching moment this year was Rahul\u0027s calling\u0026nbsphis proud mother to say he won.\u0026nbspA lovely moment to end the series on. Until next year, Paul,\u0026nbspPrue, Noel and Sandi.\u0026nbspRead along as it happened with our live-blog below. Please allow a moment to load.\u0026nbspHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Bake Off live-blog, bringing you all the latest from the\u0026nbspBerkshire based tent. Tonight, we will discover which of the three remaining bakers will be crowned this year\u0027s champion.With only hours to go until tonight\u0027s final, former contestant Terry —\u0026nbspthe older gent\u0026nbspwith the wonderful moustache, remember? —\u0026nbsphas written a letter expressing his thanks to everyone who supported him on the show. Nawwww.\u0026nbspThe latest from the bookies (because yes, you can bet on who will win Bake Off): according to one company, betting has been suspended on Rahul taking home the winner\u0027s trophy.\u0026nbspHe was on\u0026nbsp52 odds, ahead of fellow finalists Kim-Joy (31) and Ruby (31).So, how did the Bake Off finalists avoid telling letting slip\u0026nbspthat they spent\u0026nbsptheir summer baking in a tent?\u0026nbspRuby was asked recently, saying: I barely told anyone about Bake Off but the trickiest was dodging all the questions from workmates about what I was up to on weekends, where was I always going, why was I always tired.\u0026nbspI honestly blamed it on weddings. So many Indian weddings. Thank god Indian weddings normally last a week - it was a great alibi.Some quotes from Rahul: I used all of my holiday leave this year for Bake Off, which I normally would use for my trip to India.\u0026nbspI told my colleagues that this year I am not going to India, so will use up my holidays in organising my flat and having long weekend trips to the countryside.\u0026nbspFor friends outside work, the excuse was my high workload which required me to work some of the weekends. The rest of the time I said I was at barbecues or summer parties at work colleagues.And finally, the most recent words from Kim-Joy, on how she nearly revealed to a friend that she was on Bake Off: I remember a friend eating one of my practice cakes for the Bake Off, and he said to me it was delicious and I should apply for the Bake Off!\u0026nbspI was impressed with my rare ability to keep a straight face, as inside I was rolling with laughter! I said to him, \u0027Maybe next year!\u0027So it begins. The Bake Off finale is here, beginning with a quick montage of all those bakers past. Plus, Sandi teasing an outdoors challenge?\u0026nbspBake Off\u0026nbspreturns next year on\u0026nbspChanel 4.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream. On its 10th anniversary,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspspoke to a number of crypto experts who explain why this is and suggest how this might be about\u0026nbspto change.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearDespite the price falls of 2018, bitcoin has managed to maintain a period of relative stability in recent months, generally trading between $6,000 and $7,000 without any significant fluctuations. Advocates would argue that this addresses the issue of price volatility, which is seen as one of the main stumbling blocks preventing cryptocurrency from becoming a mainstream form of payment.stabilized in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But while November and December 2017 saw bitcoin\u0027s price shoot up by almost $14,000, the next couple of months are unlikely to see a repeat of this run. Analysts believe this will only change if a major event within the cryptocurrency space takes place, such as if the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which operates the New York Stock Exchange, decides to offer\u0026nbspbitcoin futures.The market is showing no real strength on either the upside of the downside, as bitcoin finds itself unable to break the $7,000 barrier.

This is evidenced by bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency turning 10, and by more and more governments, regulators, financial institutions, and retail and institutional investors, amongst others, appreciating the real and growing demand for digital, global currencies in today’s ever more digitalised and globalised world, he said.\u0026nbspThis is\u0026nbspalso underscored by the UK government Cryptoassets Taskforce’s final report which states that ‘the market is continuing to evolve rapidly\u0027, before adding ‘there is increasing institutional investment in this space, and many banks are starting to explore how they can interact with this growing market’.\u0026nbspThe report’s proactive and pragmatic approach towards regulation of the burgeoning sector should be championed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Chief executive Adrian Hallmark said the firm was already preparing by building up some stocks and switching from the port of Dover to Immingham to bring in certain parts with more contingencies to be enacted from December if needed.Like the rest of the sector, the Volkswagen-owned brand, which builds roughly 11,000 vehicles at a northern English plant in Crewe, is worried about duties and 10 percent tariffs under World Trade Organisation terms.No-deal Brexit must be ruled out to save motor industry, warns SMMTJaguar Land Rover to stop production for two weeks as demand slumpsJaguar Land Rover workers put on three-day week until ChristmasDyson to build new electric car in Singapore“Best case, it’s an annoying impact on our annual profitability,” Mr Hallmark told Reuters. “Worst case, it’s quite damaging on our annual profitability so a full no deal Brexit would hurt us as a company, it would limit ability to invest.”London and Brussels hope to strike a Brexit agreement next month but Mr Hallmark said if there was no deal by the end of the year, the automaker would have to consider stockpiling more and closing its plant for a few extra days to handle any disruption.“We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year,” he said.Britain’s overwhelmingly foreign-owned automotive industry employs more than 850,000 people and has been vocal about the benefits of keeping free and unfettered trade as thousands of cars, engines and parts move to and from the continent daily.The country’s largest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost it £1.2bn per year while Mini has moved its annual shutdown to April, just after Britain leaves the bloc.Aston Martin is even considering flying in car components if there are snarl-ups on motorways to and from Dover, prompting many, including Bentley, to consider other ports to help avoid delays.Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will get a good deal for the industry with her Chequers plan, which has faced stiff opposition from many in her party, promising a common rulebook for goods with the EU to avoid disruption.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve our objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’Click to followThe IndependentLabour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has told finance chiefs there is “nothing up my sleeve” and even offered to alter the party’s policies in response to their advice.Mr McDonnell met with a group of representatives of financial firms and other companies in the heart of the City of London on Wednesday as part of the shadow chancellor’s ongoing efforts to overcome the deep distrust – and often outright hostility – of the business sector towards the opposition party and its leadership.Labour’s nationalisation plans as dangerous as hard Brexit, says CBI“All the asset managers, the bank managers – what we’ve been saying is that what you’ll get from us is certainty. There’s nothing up my sleeve,” he told journalists.“Goldman Sachs came to see me about Brexit. I met people like\u0026nbspSchroders, because of their influence on shareholders. I’ve been meeting with some pension funds themselves – a whole range of people.”“For me a lot of it is listening to their ideas and long term plans. I say, ‘come in and advise us. Here’s our objectives, if you’re not keen or if you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve those objectives, if there’s another way of achieving those objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’”Mr McDonnell, who once listed one of his interests as “generally fermenting the overthrow of capitalism”, argued that Labour was offering more certainty to businesses than the Conservatives, whose policy of leaving the single market and customs union and countenancing of a “no-deal”\u0026nbspoutcome is a source of profound concern for business.“What they’re not getting back from the Government is certainty about Brexit – but also certainty about where the Government is going on a number of inidual domestic policies as well,” he said.Despite Mr McDonnell’s attempts to build bridges, Labour\u0026nbsphas had an extremely\u0026nbspfractious relationship with business.Last year the CBI’s director general said that the party’s nationalisation agenda and suggestion that existing PFI contrasts could be simply torn up would “send investors running for the hills”.And the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, took pride 12 months ago when an analyst at the Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, said a Labour government was a risk to investors.“When they say we’re a threat, they’re right. We’re a threat to a damaging and failing system that’s rigged for the few,” Mr Corbyn said in a social media video message.Earlier that year, Mr McDonnell said Labour had a “scenario plan” for a run on the pound in the immediate wake of a Labour election victory, although he added that he did not think a currency collapse was likely.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a second referendum on Wednesday, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would push first for a general election.\u0026nbsp“If they won’t give us a general election, yes, there’s a potential for another vote and Parliament will decide what’s on that ballot paper. But there’s a lot of stages to go before that. We think there’s a deal to be had if the Government sensibly negotiates.”Mr McDonnell’s meeting took place at the headquarters of the global media group Bloomberg, close to the Bank of England. Among the finance groups listed as invited were Aviva, Prudential and the Investment Association, as well as representatives from Pfizer, Skanska, John Lewis, Virgin Media and the Crown Estate.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Chief executive Adrian Hallmark said the firm was already preparing by building up some stocks and switching from the port of Dover to Immingham to bring in certain parts with more contingencies to be enacted from December if needed.Like the rest of the sector, the Volkswagen-owned brand, which builds roughly 11,000 vehicles at a northern English plant in Crewe, is worried about duties and 10 percent tariffs under World Trade Organisation terms.No-deal Brexit must be ruled out to save motor industry, warns SMMTJaguar Land Rover to stop production for two weeks as demand slumpsJaguar Land Rover workers put on three-day week until ChristmasDyson to build new electric car in Singapore“Best case, it’s an annoying impact on our annual profitability,” Mr Hallmark told Reuters. “Worst case, it’s quite damaging on our annual profitability so a full no deal Brexit would hurt us as a company, it would limit ability to invest.”London and Brussels hope to strike a Brexit agreement next month but Mr Hallmark said if there was no deal by the end of the year, the automaker would have to consider stockpiling more and closing its plant for a few extra days to handle any disruption.“We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year,” he said.Britain’s overwhelmingly foreign-owned automotive industry employs more than 850,000 people and has been vocal about the benefits of keeping free and unfettered trade as thousands of cars, engines and parts move to and from the continent daily.The country’s largest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has warned that the wrong Brexit deal could cost it £1.2bn per year while Mini has moved its annual shutdown to April, just after Britain leaves the bloc.Aston Martin is even considering flying in car components if there are snarl-ups on motorways to and from Dover, prompting many, including Bentley, to consider other ports to help avoid delays.Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will get a good deal for the industry with her Chequers plan, which has faced stiff opposition from many in her party, promising a common rulebook for goods with the EU to avoid disruption.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve our objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’Click to followThe IndependentLabour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has told finance chiefs there is “nothing up my sleeve” and even offered to alter the party’s policies in response to their advice.Mr McDonnell met with a group of representatives of financial firms and other companies in the heart of the City of London on Wednesday as part of the shadow chancellor’s ongoing efforts to overcome the deep distrust – and often outright hostility – of the business sector towards the opposition party and its leadership.Labour’s nationalisation plans as dangerous as hard Brexit, says CBI“All the asset managers, the bank managers – what we’ve been saying is that what you’ll get from us is certainty. There’s nothing up my sleeve,” he told journalists.“Goldman Sachs came to see me about Brexit. I met people like\u0026nbspSchroders, because of their influence on shareholders. I’ve been meeting with some pension funds themselves – a whole range of people.”“For me a lot of it is listening to their ideas and long term plans. I say, ‘come in and advise us. Here’s our objectives, if you’re not keen or if you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve those objectives, if there’s another way of achieving those objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’”Mr McDonnell, who once listed one of his interests as “generally fermenting the overthrow of capitalism”, argued that Labour was offering more certainty to businesses than the Conservatives, whose policy of leaving the single market and customs union and countenancing of a “no-deal”\u0026nbspoutcome is a source of profound concern for business.“What they’re not getting back from the Government is certainty about Brexit – but also certainty about where the Government is going on a number of inidual domestic policies as well,” he said.Despite Mr McDonnell’s attempts to build bridges, Labour\u0026nbsphas had an extremely\u0026nbspfractious relationship with business.Last year the CBI’s director general said that the party’s nationalisation agenda and suggestion that existing PFI contrasts could be simply torn up would “send investors running for the hills”.And the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, took pride 12 months ago when an analyst at the Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, said a Labour government was a risk to investors.“When they say we’re a threat, they’re right. We’re a threat to a damaging and failing system that’s rigged for the few,” Mr Corbyn said in a social media video message.Earlier that year, Mr McDonnell said Labour had a “scenario plan” for a run on the pound in the immediate wake of a Labour election victory, although he added that he did not think a currency collapse was likely.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a second referendum on Wednesday, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would push first for a general election.\u0026nbsp“If they won’t give us a general election, yes, there’s a potential for another vote and Parliament will decide what’s on that ballot paper. But there’s a lot of stages to go before that. We think there’s a deal to be had if the Government sensibly negotiates.”Mr McDonnell’s meeting took place at the headquarters of the global media group Bloomberg, close to the Bank of England. Among the finance groups listed as invited were Aviva, Prudential and the Investment Association, as well as representatives from Pfizer, Skanska, John Lewis, Virgin Media and the Crown Estate.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The cycling chain has 60 branches across the UK, and employs more than 1,000 people. In 2015, Evans was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners for £75m, however in recent months it has been scrambling to find new ownership and a £10m cash injection. House of Fraser blames ‘greedy landlords’ for store closure risksMike Ashley needs a new approach to make House of Fraser like HarrodsMike Ashley\u0027s House of Fraser deal boosts Debenhams with merger hopesA pre-pack administration process allows the sale of an insolvent business before administrators have been appointed. \u0026nbspEvans was previously reported to be fielding offers from rival Halfords, JD Sports, and a number of others, but\u0026nbspMike Ashley won out. No purchase price has been disclosed.\u0026nbspMr Ashley said: We are pleased to have rescued the Evans Cycles brand. However, in order to save the business we only believe we will be able to keep 50 per cent of stores open in the future. Unfortunately some stores will have to close.”Matt Callaghan, PwC partner and joint administrator for Evans, said: “2018 has been a very difficult trading year for the business, in part due to the impact of the extended winter weather in the early part of the year and a lack of cash to invest in stores and develop the online platform.“A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch.”He added: “Evans is a long-standing, well known and trusted brand with nearly 100 years of heritage in the cycling market. To have managed to preserve the business and transfer all staff to the purchaser is particularly pleasing.”James Keany at CBRE has been retained on all property related aspects, Sports Direct said.Mr Keany said: We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of inidual stores.Mr Ashley has been adding to his retail empire recently, buying House of Fraser out of administration for £90m in August. He has managed to save a number of House of Fraser stores previously earmarked for closure, but has apparently clashed with landlords at other locations.A spokesperson for House of Fraser said recently: “Some landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs.“However, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people.“We will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it is concerned that general insurance pricing practices “have the potential to cause harm to consumers, particularly those who are vulnerable”.The watchdog said supervisory work on home insurance had uncovered a number of issues that “could cause harm to customers”, including\u0026nbspfirms failing to have appropriate or clear pricing strategies, governance and controls.Banks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEStudents targeted by ‘ghost brokers’ selling fake car insuranceInsurers criticised for failing mental health sufferersAndrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Our initial work has identified a number of areas of potential consumer harm. We want to make sure that general insurance markets deliver competitive and fair prices for all consumers. “This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market.“If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this.”Gareth Shaw,\u0026nbspmoney expert at Which?, said: “This review is long overdue. For years, loyal policyholders have been exploited by insurance providers, punished by excessive premiums, and have had to battle with unclear pricing that makes it difficult for people to understand whether or not they’re getting a fair deal. “Customers who prefer to stay with one provider are at risk of being hit with vastly overpriced premiums when little has changed in the service they receive. It’s right that the regulator tackles this sector to ensure customers aren’t punished for their loyalty and that pricing is clear and transparent across the industry.”Georgie Frost, consumer advocate at GoCompare, said the investigation was welcome “because clearly something isn’t right and people feel they are being ripped off”. \u0026nbsp“Clearer rules and regulations will be better for everyone because we can’t have a system where it is the most vulnerable that are the hardest hit,” she said.“Equally, some people who can switch aren’t doing so and we need to find out why and make sure they are fully engaged.“The ‘tease and squeeze’ approach to pricing is the go-to tactic in many industries, including car and home insurance. New customers are enticed with a competitive price and then, if they don’t shop around and switch, they face often stealthy – sometimes blatant – premium increases in subsequent years.“It’s imperative that people keep shopping around and switching to avoid getting ripped off, but more also needs to be done to make it clearer how customers can switch.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And there have been reports that some students stopped\u0026nbspgoing to school once they secured a guaranteed place.\u0026nbspIn an\u0026nbspinterview with The Independent earlier this year, Clare Marchant, head of the universities and colleges admissions service (Ucas), called for an urgent rethink of the practise.\u0026nbspMatt\u0026nbspWaddup, head of policy and campaigns at\u0026nbspthe University and College Union (UCU), said: The decision by St Mary’s demonstrates the desperate need to overhaul our failing admissions system.We are alone in the world in persisting with a system where students are offered university places based on highly inaccurate predicted grades.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British Prime Minister Theresa May, right, listens to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, center, flanked by Lithuania\u0027s Health Minister, Aurelijus Veryga at the Oslo Cancer Cluster for a summit to discuss the role of health technology.

The cycling chain has 60 branches across the UK, and employs more than 1,000 people. In 2015, Evans was sold to private equity firm ECI Partners for £75m, however in recent months it has been scrambling to find new ownership and a £10m cash injection. House of Fraser blames ‘greedy landlords’ for store closure risksMike Ashley needs a new approach to make House of Fraser like HarrodsMike Ashley\u0027s House of Fraser deal boosts Debenhams with merger hopesA pre-pack administration process allows the sale of an insolvent business before administrators have been appointed. \u0026nbspEvans was previously reported to be fielding offers from rival Halfords, JD Sports, and a number of others, but\u0026nbspMike Ashley won out. No purchase price has been disclosed.\u0026nbspMr Ashley said: We are pleased to have rescued the Evans Cycles brand. However, in order to save the business we only believe we will be able to keep 50 per cent of stores open in the future. Unfortunately some stores will have to close.”Matt Callaghan, PwC partner and joint administrator for Evans, said: “2018 has been a very difficult trading year for the business, in part due to the impact of the extended winter weather in the early part of the year and a lack of cash to invest in stores and develop the online platform.“A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch.”He added: “Evans is a long-standing, well known and trusted brand with nearly 100 years of heritage in the cycling market. To have managed to preserve the business and transfer all staff to the purchaser is particularly pleasing.”James Keany at CBRE has been retained on all property related aspects, Sports Direct said.Mr Keany said: We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of inidual stores.Mr Ashley has been adding to his retail empire recently, buying House of Fraser out of administration for £90m in August. He has managed to save a number of House of Fraser stores previously earmarked for closure, but has apparently clashed with landlords at other locations.A spokesperson for House of Fraser said recently: “Some landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs.“However, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people.“We will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out. Some closures will be announced.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They each try to collect the most spirits they can and then carry them back to their base, in two minutes, at which point the round comes to an end and a winner is declared.Google Doodle reveals the most searched for recipes in every stateBut it\u0027s also more complicated than that: the game offers a wide variety of different maps, as well as powerups that make it a little more varied. Players can get the ability to move around more quickly or to see in the dark, for instance.As well as being able to play in teams – either with strangers or people you know – each player is given personal awards depending on how they\u0027ve done.Special technologies had to be built to allow for the first multiplayer version of the game, Google said. The team built several systems to enable this multiplayer gaming, all running on the Google Cloud Platform, including integrating Open Match, a highly-scalable, open source matchmaking framework cofounded by Google Cloud and Unity, it wrote in a blog post announcing the new game.The Doodle is showing around almost all of the world – though not in Africa and some specific countries – and will presumably stick around until Halloween is over.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Financial Conduct Authority said it is concerned that general insurance pricing practices “have the potential to cause harm to consumers, particularly those who are vulnerable”.The watchdog said supervisory work on home insurance had uncovered a number of issues that “could cause harm to customers”, including\u0026nbspfirms failing to have appropriate or clear pricing strategies, governance and controls.Banks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEStudents targeted by ‘ghost brokers’ selling fake car insuranceInsurers criticised for failing mental health sufferersAndrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Our initial work has identified a number of areas of potential consumer harm. We want to make sure that general insurance markets deliver competitive and fair prices for all consumers. “This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market.“If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this.”Gareth Shaw,\u0026nbspmoney expert at Which?, said: “This review is long overdue. For years, loyal policyholders have been exploited by insurance providers, punished by excessive premiums, and have had to battle with unclear pricing that makes it difficult for people to understand whether or not they’re getting a fair deal. “Customers who prefer to stay with one provider are at risk of being hit with vastly overpriced premiums when little has changed in the service they receive. It’s right that the regulator tackles this sector to ensure customers aren’t punished for their loyalty and that pricing is clear and transparent across the industry.”Georgie Frost, consumer advocate at GoCompare, said the investigation was welcome “because clearly something isn’t right and people feel they are being ripped off”. \u0026nbsp“Clearer rules and regulations will be better for everyone because we can’t have a system where it is the most vulnerable that are the hardest hit,” she said.“Equally, some people who can switch aren’t doing so and we need to find out why and make sure they are fully engaged.“The ‘tease and squeeze’ approach to pricing is the go-to tactic in many industries, including car and home insurance. New customers are enticed with a competitive price and then, if they don’t shop around and switch, they face often stealthy – sometimes blatant – premium increases in subsequent years.“It’s imperative that people keep shopping around and switching to avoid getting ripped off, but more also needs to be done to make it clearer how customers can switch.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Pencil gets the biggest redesign, with a new shape, a button that can be used to change settings by pressing the side of the stylus, and magnets that allow it to clip onto the top of the tablet and charge as it does so.Live updates as Apple reveals whole suite of new productsThe new iPad Pro comes in two sizes. The smaller 11-inch takes up the same size as the existing 10.50-inch, using the extra space from the smaller bezels to pack in a bigger display the bigger 12.9-inch is the same screen size but has been reduced overall.Inside, it includes Apple\u0027s latest A12X bionic chip, which is an upgraded version of the processor in the iPhone XS and XR. It said that and other upgrades allow the new Pro to rival the Xbox One S for gaming performance, which it displayed by showing the latest version of the NBA 2K series.As well as those changes, Apple also swapped out the Lightning port that has traditionally been on the bottom of the iPad. In its place comes a USB-C port, which means that the tablet can be plugged into accessories like cameras or musical equipment – as well as charging the iPhone.The new iPads are available to order now, ahead of their full release on 7 November.

That allows the computer to be unlocked and things to be bought just by pressing the sensor next to the keyboard.It also includes Apple\u0027s newest keyboard and trackpad, the latter of which is 20 per cent bigger and stretches all the way across the top.The new computer has speakers that are 25 per cent louder, twice as much bass and wider stereo sound. It also has a new microphone, which allows people to sound better on FaceTime calls as well as being used for Siri, which is always listening and can be activated just by saying Hey Siri at any time.The MacBook Air will start at $1199, considerably more expensive than the old version of the computer. It can be pre-ordered now and will arrive on 7 November.But Apple appeared to be most proud of its new way of making aluminium, which allows it to make the computers using entirely recycled metal. That is why Apple is referring to the computer as its greenest ever Mac.The new MacBook Air was revealed at the same time Apple also revealed a new Mac Mini. That computer is vastly faster than the mostly neglected old version, as well as using the new kind of aluminium.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The group posted an 8 per cent decline in retail sales, against a 12.7 per cent increase in online sales.

However, shares dropped almost 5 per cent in early trading on Wednesday as sales growth slowed in the third quarter. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, put this decline down to the warmer weather in the first half of the year, which boosted trading at Next. “More recently, an Indian summer stretching into October will have pushed back the need for scarves and mittens,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Nonetheless Next still remains on track to deliver its projected profits for this year.”Mr Khalaf added: “With Christmas on the horizon we’re now approaching a crunch time for UK retailers, and in January’s trading statements we’ll get a good gauge of UK consumer appetite, and a roll call of winners and losers on the UK high street.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They leave warm waters behind so they lose that energy source. But often they can get swept up into the jet stream and that provides another fuel source for these ex-hurricanes and by later Thursday.BBC Weather host Susan Powell also forecast the leftovers of Storm Oscar to make its way to the UK on Friday, bringing some very wet and windy weather while also bumping temperatures back up to average.She said: \u0026ldquoBy the end of the week, however, we\u0026rsquore facing a prospect of a deep area of low pressure rolling our way, containing the remnants of Tropical Storm Oscar.\u0026ldquoWarm tropical air is tied up in this system so it will bump our temperatures up to average values, but it looks like it will perhaps bring us widespread gales, and a hooking of very heavy rain.

That’s when I saw they were completely black, no iris, no white, nothing. I jumped back and grabbed my daughter. When I looked again, the child was gone. It was so strange.”Various paranormal experts have since investigated the area, with the YouTube channel Haunted Finders even managing to capture the ghost on camera in .But its not just ghosts that are thought to haunt Britains streets - many Brits claim to have seen vampires and werewolves too.In , a man named Bill Ramsey, , took himself to Southend Police Station and asked to be locked up for his and the public’s safety, claiming he was a savage werewolf.The officers on duty were reluctant to put him in the cells after seeing he had no criminal history.But it was at this point that Bill turned, growling and snarling at Duty Sergeant Terry Fisher before grabbing the ft tall,  stone police officer by the throat and throwing him across the station’s car park.Chaos ensued and a total of eight police officers were required to restrain the werewolf man, who was fighting them on all fours.That wasn’t the end of the ordeal though.Bill then used his strength to smash his way through a re-enforced hatch in his cell’s door, managing to get both his arm and head stuck in the opening before he was sedated with a dose nearly three times the amount of an average person.PC Tony Belford said that he’d never seen anything like it before or since - and the news even made The Sun’s front page – earning Bill the nickname of ‘The Southend Werewolf’.Cemeteries are creepy places. But in the late s and early s there was an added spookiness to the decaying and decrepit Highgate Cemetery in North London, after numerous people reported sightings of a supernatural being.One was made by British Psychic and Occult Society member David Farrant, who wrote a letter to the Hampstead and Highgate Express claiming that he had seen “a grey figure” in the cemetery Christmas Eve .A handful of people claimed that they had also seen a tall, dark figure, floating behind the railings.These reports caught the interest of another local man Sean Manchester – a real-le vampire hunter – who believed that the ghostly figure was that of a Romanian ‘Vampire of the Undead’ that had been brought to England in the early s.Finally, after  years of hunting, Manchester published a book in which he claimed to have successfully staked, beheaded and burnt the vampire.But with no photo evidence, some believe the vampire could still be out there.While the ghost of the young girl in Cannock Chase ran away from people, there have been reports of ghosts who have attacked people in the UK, too.Greyfriars Cemetery in Edinburgh, Scotland, is home to a number of notable names, including Thomas Riddell – the inspiration Voldemort in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books.But the cemetery is also home to one resident even more chilling than the Dark Lord himself.Sir George ‘Bluid’ MacKenzie was a th century lawyer who is blamed for the deaths of thousands of men during Charles II’s religious persecution of Presbyterians in Scotland - and his ghost still haunts the area to this day.MacKenzie laid undisturbed for more than  years before his spirit was reportedly first encountered in .A homeless man decided to take shelter in MacKenzie’s final resting place – the Black Mausoleum – on a dark and stormy night when something terrying happened.An ancient coffin allegedly collapsed beneath him, plunging him into a pit containing still decomposing plague victims, and the man ran from the scene covered in dust, startling a passerby that was out walking their dog.It is believed that the incident disturbed the spirit of MacKenzie,  and since then there have been more than  recorded incidents of poltergeist attacks on members of the public there.Volunteer guide Willie Telford told Edinburgh Evening News: “People have been bitten, scratched, kicked, pushed, they get burn marks, they feel sick, they feel cold.And it gets worse.Borley Rectory in Essex is widely regarded as ‘the most haunted house in England’.There have been reports of strange incidents at the Victorian house for decades, including sightings of a ghost nun and a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen.But things really escalated in , when the resident Reverend Guy Eric Smith contacted a national newspaper to report otherworldly activity, including bells ringing and the sound of footsteps.The paper sent paranormal investigator Harry Price to carry out research, and the activity intensied, with reports including the throwing of vases and stones.The Smiths soon left the property, with the reverend’s we believing that Price had been behind it all. But the strange occurrences continued.Smith’s replacement, Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster, also recorded incidents including bell-ringing, writing appearing on the wall and even his we, Marianne, being thrown from her bed by a poltergeist.The mystery remained unsolved and the house burnt down in  before being completely demolished five years later.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This will mean that the government’s flagship welfare reform is now more generous than the benefit system that it is replacing.While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with Universal Credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.But Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd said it wouldnt cover all the costs of the Osborne cuts., and there were still issues with the new system.He raged: UC’s serious design flaws were also not addressed, from long waiting times that are pushing people into indebtedness, to problems in how landlords are paid housing benefit.The pain caused by the roll-out of UC is not over yet.Today we revealed how a single mum is at risk of homelessness after going on to the new system - and isnt eligible for help with her mortgage debt payments.Tina Davidson says she feels tossed aside by the system and has had to put the house shes lived in for  years up for sale to pay off debts.The new system is designed to try and get more Brits into work and less reliant on the welfare system, but its been beset with problems.Many say its pushing them into debt as the wait for the first payment is at least five weeks.Others say they were driven to payday loans and even prostitution to try and make ends meet.Ministers say they are constantly trying to fix the systems problems as they go along - and the new system is much less complicated than the old one.It was reported earlier this month that ministers are planning moves to slow down the roll out to try and fix some of the issues.They can take out emergency loans, but have to start paying them back immediately so they get deducted from their benefits.Highlights of todays Budget include:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443834272-e1540837806705.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"latest telethon shows us once and for all that c4s just a load of cake and balls","story":"You watch BBC’s Children In Need, you’re getting Clare Balding, Doctor Who and dancers, whether you like it or not.ITV  It’d take sniper fire or a dinner setting next to Sir Phillip Green before Cowell was a no-show.Channel , though Apart from a bit of a secondhand cake-baking and Gogglebox, I was drawing a blank before Friday night.So it was with a mix of fascination and dread that I tuned into Stand Up To Cancer. A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another £.billion to iron out Universal Credit problems. A near five per cent hike in the minimum wage. A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes. A huge increase in firms’ annual investment allowance will let them deduct from taxable profits up to £million spent on tools and machinery.Heathrow’s e-gates will now speed up entry for visitors from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as Europe — a symbol of a global Britain open for business.Some bad ideas The Sun has criticised, including the proposed “latte levy” on plastic cups, were binned. Duty was frozen again on fuel, as well as beer.Even the OBR’s normally pessimistic forecasts were on Mr Hammond’s side. Growth is predicted to rise steadily, albeit too slowly. Unemployment is set to fall to its lowest in  years.We wish the Chancellor had outlined more radical, visionary low-tax measures. He will need them should Brussels shove us into a no-deal Brexit. But that gripe aside, what was not to like The Tories must not try to ape Corbyn’s £trillion spending fantasy. But it is not “Corbyn-lite” to spend billions fixing Britain’s most pressing problems, evenwe are still running a deficit.As for Corbyn himself, it was obvious he took in barely a word of the Budget.In his “response” he merely recited his normal scripted complaints, flubbing his words and shouting randomly, as is now traditional. He somehow contrives to make even this chaotic Government look like a model of competence.Budgets often unravel when acres of small print are finally scrutinised.But for now... nice one, Chancellor.ANGELA Merkel is a once-brilliant politician scuppered by an arrogant disregard for voters.For years she was admired worldwide.

Cheyenne is really sweet about it and she doesnt really understand, thank goodness.We try to keep her away from it.But when she sees Im upset, she will come over and cuddle me and say its okay mummy. Its horrible and the people that are supposed to help just dont care.They are heartless.And she avoided going to the food bank for help because she was expecting to be paid on time.Kind strangers and neighbours have been helping her out with food in the meantime.Partner Chris was also signed off work as a chef for mental health reasons.A DWP spokesperson said: The vast majority of claimants are paid in full and on time, and are comfortable managing their money.

Cost of damage to the police car, Ford Fiesta and the HGV was estimated at a total of £,.In the earlier incident Parkinson and a group of friends stole a disabled mans Renault Scenic along with his disability scooter which was in the boot.Police chased him again and blocked in the stolen car in a suburban street where children were playing but Parkinson drove up on to the pavement, narrowly missing a child, before driving off at speed and losing the officers.The Renault was found days later completely written off, and the disability scooter was also damaged to the stage it was deemed redundant.In court Parkinson yawned and stretched his arms over-dramatically as he listened to the proceedings. He admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, driving while disqualied and twice breaching a criminal behaviour.Judge Mark Savill told him: “You have shown a lack of respect for the police and a lack of remorse and you have expressed no desire to change. So I must put the protection of the public and a punishment for you first.”He added: Youre just  but have an appalling record and the footage of the pursuit I have seen is truly chilling. Many people have the good sense to lie when they say they want to change their ways, but you have no idea.“That police officer could have been killed because of your selfishness. It is a wonder how you didn’t kill or seriously injure a member of the public or a police officer.“Your pre-sentence report makes a depressing read. I know you have dficulties in your le but you have indicated a lack of remorse and have expressed no desire to change.“You present a high risk of reoffending.“I am not going to impose a sentence that will crush any hope you have - but you cannot reoffend like this.”Parkinson was also disqualied from driving for five years.

Pakistan’s Supreme Court must be appreciated that it upheld the law of the land and didn’t succumb to any pressure.”Authorities have stepped up security at churches around the country.Shortly after the ruling, hundreds of Islamists blocked a key road linking the city of Rawalpindi with the capital, Islamabad.Islamists gathered in Pakistans largest city, Karachi, in the northwestern city of Peshawar and where. Police urged demonstrators to disperse peacefully.In the eastern city of Multan, police arrested several demonstrators after clashes.Paramilitary troops deployed in Islamabad to prevent protesters from reaching the Supreme Court, where security for the judges was being beefed up.Her case outraged Christians worldwide and has been a source of ision within Pakistan, where two politicians who tried to help the mum-of-four were assassinated.Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in  for defending Bibi and criticising the misuse of the blasphemy law.The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hard-liners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad.Supporters of Islamist political party Tehreek-e-Labaik , which was founded to support Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws, immediately condemned the ruling and blocked roads in Karachi, the country’s largest city, and in the city of Lahore.Chanting Hang infidel Asia, activists from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik party also rallied in other cities on Friday, threatening nationwide protestsauthorities free the woman.Pakistans Supreme Court last week postponed ruling on her final appeal but today freed her.She has been held at an undisclosed location for security reasons and is expected to leave the country.That decision has angered Islamists who want her to be publicly hanged - which would have made her her the first person to be executed for blasphemy in Pakistan.Bibis first appeal was dismissed by a Lahore High Court in , but the Supreme Court stayed her execution in .The charge against Bibi dates back to a hot day in  when she went to get water for her and her fellow farmworkers.Two Muslim women refused to take a drink from a container used by a Christian.A few days later, a mob accused her of blasphemy and she was convicted and sentenced to death.Bibis lawyer, Saul Malook, argued that the many contradictions in witnesses statements tainted the evidence.The two Muslim women who levelled the charges against Bibi denied they were quarrelling with her, saying her outbursts against Islam were unprovoked.Yet several independent witnesses who gave statements recounted a cantankerous exchange between the women.The prosecutions case centred mostly on religious texts that vily those who make blasphemous statements.Ahead of the hearing, Malook expressed optimism that he would win the last legal appeal for Bibi.Butnot, he planned to seek a review, which could take years to complete.He said: I am a  percent sure she will be acquitted. She has a very good case.Bibis case has generated international outrage, but within Pakistan it has fired up radical Islamists, who use the blasphemy law to rally supporters and intimidate mainstream political parties.Members of Pakistans religious minorities have campaigned against the law, which they say is invoked to justy attacks on them.For them, Bibis case is seen as a watershed - and her husband recently travelled to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis.Joseph Francis, an activist for Pakistans Christians, said France, Spain and Germany have all offered to welcome Bibi should she be acquitted.But Khadim Hussein Rizvi, the leader of a radical Islamist party, warned after the postponement that no blasphemer will be able to escape punishment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0003143908921.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit budget changes","story":"The major changes revealed by Philip Hammond this week to the new flagship system won’t come in for months, and are set to exclude some groups.The Chancellor said he would increase the work allowance for those on Universal Credit by £, meaning working Brits, or those who are disabled can keep £ extra every year of their own money.But Brits on benefits are only eligible for a work allowancethey have kids or have a limited capacity for work. .million are expected to get a boost.The work allowances are £ a monthyour benefits includes housing support, or £ without it.But respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said there would be around .million Brits who would not benefit.They said: “For many people this increase in work allowances will essentially undo the cuts announced by George Osborne in  – though not for the childless non-disabled.“Their work allowances were cut to zero in  and there they remain.”Labour’s John McDonnell said today there was “nothing for Universal Credit recipients who are single and without children”.Households on the minimum wage, working full-time with with no dependent children are still expected to be £ worse off than they were in , think tanks estimated.Changes set to come in in  will mean Brits will be able to get an extra two weeks of benefits from Jobseeker’s Allowance, ESA and Income Support as a result of yesterday’s changes.That’s in addition to housing benefit, which already sees Brits get paid an extra fortnight of help when they switch over.But those waiting for working tax credits or child tax credits on the new system will continue to be left high and dry for that cash for the full five weeks.David Finch, Senior Fellow at the Resolution Foundation said: “Of course, these welcome changes won’t solve all of the problems surrounding UC, particularly as the extra two-weeks of benefit“But it does at least show that the government is starting to listen to the experts, and making signicant improvements to the system.”The IFS added that there are still around £billion of net welfare cuts set to be made to the overall budget, which would include the freezing of most working age benefits again from next April.This is set to be confirmed in the coming weeks, causing another  months of misery for families.That will cost working families another £ a year worse off in .Jessica Prestidge, senior researcher at Bright Blue warned: “Despite these welcome changes to Universal Credit, many low-income families will continue to face a signicant squeeze on their real incomes thanks to unnecessary and deep cuts to working-aged benefits.

As Nye Bevan once said “the language of priorities is the religion of socialism.” In his Budget on Monday Philip Hammond made clear his priorities and he definitely wasn’t praying at the altar of socialism. When presented with the choice of cutting taxes for the wealthy or helping those on the lowest incomes, he went for the former . Presented with the choice of handing high earners more than pound a year or ending the welfare freeze, he went for the former. Presented with the choice of cutting corporation tax or additional funding for education, the police and local government, he went for the former. Which made it remarkable that John McDonnell yesterday said Labour would not reverse the income tax measures in the Budget even though % of the tax cuts will benefit the top half of earners. Andy Burnham was one of many Labour figures to warn McDonnell’s position would not hold. The Greater Manchester mayor said he could not see how tax cuts for the wealthiest could be the priority when the police were so stretched and there are “people dying on British streets for want of a roof over their head.” Many Labour MPs also voiced concerns. Jess Phillips put it succinctly in a tweet this morning: “When Philip Green gets more from the budget than a midwe might I suggest we are on sh**ty ground.” The Shadow Chancellor, who is meeting business leaders today, is showing a pragmatism that comes with the challenge of seeking power. But you cannot help thinking thata previous Labour leadership had adopted this position he would have been one of the first to object. Even when Hammond made the right choice - the additional funding for the NHS - it fell short of what is required. As the IFS noted yesterday, the lt in NHS spending amounts to an increase of .% a year which is below the average increases of .% a year over the NHS’s entire history and the % a year over the period of the last Labour government."},{"url":null,"title":"labour vow end benefits freeze","story":"NewsLabour promise to end benefits freeze hit by confusion after new comments by Jeremy Corbyns spokesmanLabour WILL halt the Tories cruel four-year freeze on welfare payments - but it seems that might not actually mean raising them with inflationShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe comments by Jeremy Corbyns spokesman appeared to contradict John McDonnell \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabours vow to end the benefits freeze was thrown into confusion today after new comments by Jeremy Corbyns spokesman. The spokesman insisted Labour WILL halt the Tories cruel four-year freeze on welfare payments - which takes poundbillion a year from the pockets of the nations poorest. But he did NOT confirm Labour will raise benefits every year in line with inflation. Campaigners saythis doesnt happen, it will be a real-terms cut - continuing the pain for millions of families. The spokesmans comments appear to contradict both Labours shadow chancellor and its welfare chief.  John McDonnell told the Mirror only last week that Labour would uprate benefits with inflation. Askeduprating benefits with inflation every year was the specic policy, the Shadow Chancellor told us: Yes, that’s what we’ve said. He later added: We’re saying we’re uprating. Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary has also told the Mirror she would uprate benefits with inflation. Margaret Greenwood told us last month: We would end the benefits freeze, and that would mean uprating in line with inflation every year.  But today, Mr Corbyns spokesman said raising benefits with inflation was a dferent issue to Labours confirmed policy of ending the freeze. Instead, he said the definition of ending the freeze was you start to increase benefits again. He added ending a freeze can mean turning on the temperature to dferent degrees. Asked directlya rise could be less than inflation, he said: Exactly how that will be spelt out in the next manesto and the exact commitment is part of that review [of benefits]. But that we will end the benefits freeze is a commitment.  Speaking at a briefing for Westminster journalists, he added: A freeze means you dont increase anything. If you move off it, the freeze has ended. Cruel Tories have frozen benefit rates for four years to slash pound.billion a year from the welfare bill by  . During last years election campaign there was a row over Labours policy when Jeremy Corbyn said the party would not freeze benefits – but stopped short of saying rates would be uprated in line with inflation. Today Mr Corbyns spokesman claimed the Labour leader had promised to end the benefits freeze all along. The exchange in full JOURNALIST: Just to get the meaning clear, will a Labour government uprate benefits every year in line with inflation JEREMY CORBYNS SPOKESMAN: Thats a dferent issue, weve said we-Its not, thats exactly what ending the benefits freeze is, so is that what Labour will do The commitment to end the freeze is to move off the freeze, that means you start to increase benefits again.It could be partially defrosted The freeze - its a switch on or off. A freeze means off. If you turn it on, you can turn it on to dferent degrees. But anyway... So it wouldnt necessarily be in line with inflation, it could be less than inflation Thats the point John was referring to, exactly how that will be spelt out in the next manesto and the exact commitment is part of that review, but that we will end the benefits freeze is a commitment.I asked John McDonnell last week whether Labour would uprate benefits in line with inflation every year and he said yes. So was he wrong  Im confused, Im genuinely confused.The point Im making is the commitment to end the freeze is there, the exact form that the restructuring of the benefits system, including Universal Credit, is going to take under our policies - only some elements of that have been spelt out.

The Prime Minister announced that austerity is over at the Conservative Party conference and the claim was repeated in Mondays budget. But today the House of Commons descended into laughter when Mrs May insisted austerity is indeed ending. There were jeers as she insisted there was more money in the budget for schools, record spending on the NHS and sidestepped a question about community policing. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studiesdeclared the package of measures doesnt end austerity - at least not yet.  Jeremy Corbyn quoted the expert analysis saying: Now we know councils, schools, police, prisons, public sector workers and those reliant on social security will face years of austerity. He asked Theresa May: Will she apologise for her broken promise that she was going to end austerity because she has failed to do that  The Prime Minister declared: Ending austerity isnt just about putting more into public services, its about putting more into peoples pockets. But Jeremy Corbyn tore those claims apart. He said: Austerity has failed and it needs to end now.  Only Labour can be trusted to end austerity, end the cuts to those on lowest incomes and invest in our country again. At the Conservative Party conference the Prime Minister said: a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off. Delivering his budget on Monday Chancellor Philip Hammond claimed that the era of austerity was coming to an end.

Jeremy Corbyn won the first, demonstrating austerity isnt over as Theresa May pretended in her Tory conference speech earlier this month in Birmingham. Most public services are still being squeezed and the Conservatives are the party of lawlessness and disorder as crime rises after deep cuts in policing. No wonder the cops are taking the Government to court.  And lower income households will be worse off, Corbyn giving the pledge missing in Labours  election manesto to end a social security freeze. But May won the second half, and the game, by ruthlessly exploiting Labour confusion over tax cuts for higher earners. Initially backing them then deciding to abstain following a revolt by Labour MPs was a rare own goal by the partys leadership.  The PM seized a gt that was her Budget Get Out of Jail Free card. May will have enjoyed her day in the House of Commons more than Corbyn.

He had also been spotted wearing a Trump Make America Great Again hat on numerous occasions, and praised the President on Twitter. He had also recently been associated with the Blexit movement, organised by ultra-conservative Candace Owens, which called on the black community to abandon the Democratic Party ahead of next weeks midterm elections. But last night he claimed he had been used, and was stepping back from politics to concentrate on being creative.  The rapper tweeted last night that his eyes are now wide open, and that he now realises hed been, used to spread messages I dont believe in. But the change in tone has not gone down well with the former England centre-forward, who fired off a furious response this morning.He tweeted: . Youre an Uncle Tom.. Adidas probably were ready to throw you in the bin.. You never were into politics, you wore a red hat twice you f*****g idiot.. If the black community buy this shit, more fool them. Deceitful b*****d.Uncle Tom is a reference to the  novel Uncle Toms Cabin, and is used to mean a person of colour who is seen as subserviently doing the work of their white masters.  Earlier, the Yeezus rapper called out Candace Owens, who had associated him with Blexit, black exit from Democratic Party, and said that Kanye had created the logo and colours of this renaissance. The -year-old star tweeted that he was not behind any logo and didnt want to be involved. He wrote: I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it.  After meeting with Trump at the White House earlier in the month, in which he discussed subjects ranging from criminal justice reform to gang violence, Kanye felt he needed to set the record straight on a number of other beliefs he had, after feeling he was being misappropriated.  What he did reveal though was his stance on the gun laws in the States. Kanye tweeted: I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most, I support prison reform, I support common-sense gun laws that will make our world safer. Megan Barton Hanson trusts Wes Nelson completely after cheating rumours: We’re quite private and I think that helps a lotHe also thanked his family and friends in supporting his, actual beliefs and my vision for a better world. In a further tweet, Kanye took aim at those in power and wrote that he supported,holding people who misuse their power accountable. For now though, Kanye is going to leave politicising to others. That is, until he feels the need to share his thoughts on such matters once again.

Parkinson, who has an appalling record amassed since he was just eleven, also posted bragging pictures of himself smoking suspicious looking cigarettes on social media and spelt his own name in cannabis leaves.  Yesterday he began a sentence at a young offenders institution for another string of offences, including reversing a stolen Fiesta into a police officer who was trying to catch him. Parkinson stretched and yawned loudly as he was handed a four-year sentence at Manchesters Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Evening News reports.Describing how Parkinson had reversed into the police officer, the judge said: You tried to get past and rammed into the front of the lorry. The very brave police officer, doing what police officers do on behalf of decent members of society, got out and tried to approach you. What did you do  You reversed. The door was open and caught him, sending him flying onto the bonnet of his car. What he must have been wondering at that time one can only imagine. The court heard how the police officer could have been killed. Parkinson had amassed  previous convictions for  crimes from the age of , the court heard.This included twice assaulting police officers as well as robbery, violence, theft of vehicles and flouting court orders. His defence barrister told the court Parkinson had one of the worst starts in le I have seen and is extremely immature for his age. The judge said he accepted what the teenagers barrister said, but added that there comes a time when the public has to be protected. Parkinsons name and face were earlier published on October , , when he was made the subject of a criminal behaviour order which banned him from the Smallshaw estate in Tameside and disqualied him from driving until . The order made little effect.  On May , this year, he stole a specially-adapted Renault Scenic, which carried on board a mobility scooter and was owned by a disabled man. The owner thought he had lost the keys and had called for roadside assistance, but then saw Parkinson and his young male friends get in the car, with the keys, start the engine and drive away. The car was spotted in the Smallshaw estate that night, with residents reporting a car was screaming around the streets while children were out playing, prosecutor Jon Close told the court. Police patrols gave chase but the stolen Scenic mounted the pavement, narrowly missed a child and sped away, the judge heard. Patrols managed to stop the badly damaged car after it was spotted being driven recklessly again, but the occupants fled.  The car had to be written off and the mobility scooter was also damaged. Parkinson was arrested, charged and appeared before magistrates who released him on bail on June  - a decision described as astonishing by the judge because of his appalling criminal record. It was while on bail - and also on licence for another crime - he went on to commit more and worse crimes. Within three weeks of being released, on June , Parkinson was spotted at the wheel of a stolen Ford Fiesta which he drove at speeds topping mph around Tameside in an attempt to escape the law. The pursuit was captured by a dash camera mounted in the pursuing police car and the footage was played in court. It showed the Fiesta speeding in Ashton-under-Lyne but being forced to stop because a civic-minded HGV driver, who was coming from the opposite direction, used his vehicle to block any escape. PC Christopher Haxby is seen getting out of his patrol car to arrest the driver but Parkinson simply reverses, smashing the open door of the Fiesta into the officer, propelling the bobby onto the bonnet of his own vehicle.  The brave cop is seen to pick himself up, draw his Taser stun gun and order the occupants from the vehicle. He is heard shouting: Get out! Get on the f***ing floor now. Parkinson ran away but was arrested after a brief foot-chase, although he tried to claim during his police interview that he had not been the driver of the Fiesta. The damage caused to the police patrol car was estimated at pound,, while the stolen Fiesta required repairs costing pound,. The HGV had been damaged to the tune of pound,. PC Haxby suffered whiplash as well as injuries to his right leg and shoulder. He could have been killed, noted Judge Martin Savill. After brief details of Parkinsons criminal record were read out, the judge went on: That to me sums up this young mans approach to le. He couldnt care less. He associated with children rather than youths his own age, the court heard. The report describes him as effectively bringing himself up, said Mr Fireman.  Addressing the defendant, who appeared in court via video-link, Judge Savill said he accepted what the barrister said but added that there comes a time when the public has to be protected. This young mans record for one his age is so that it passes beyond the bounds of appalling, said Mr Fireman, while the judge noted that the defendant had unashamedly told probation workers he was unwilling to change. A judge slammed Parkinsons quite appalling criminal record. He sent Parkinson to a young offenders institution for four years and disqualied him from driving for five years. I can only hope this will offer you some cause to consider where your le is going, Judge Savill told him. But Parkinson appeared unconcerned, stretching and yawning loudly as the sentencing hearing drew to a close. How long did I get  How long gets taken off forremand and that  he asked an unseen official in the room at a detention centre where he is being held. Parkinson, of Ashton-under-Lyne, had pleaded guilty to two counts of disqualied driving, two counts of dangerous driving, twice breaching his criminal behaviour order, aggravated vehicle taking, assault causing actual bodily harm and driving without insurance.

Jack Schumann, , suffered with depression ever since the death of his -month-old daughter in October , an inquest heard. The mechanic, from Oldham, Manchester, had been using alcohol as a coping mechanism but quickly developed a dependency, the coroner was told.An inquest into Jacks death heard he would drink up to  cans of cider a day, Manchester Evening News reports.His mother Tracy Schumann believes her son may have been able to tackle the addiction had more services been available to him. She told the coroner Jack had been offered a bed at the Drug and Alcohol Inpatient Unit at Prestwich Hospital in , but she said he missed out after he was forced to attend a meeting about Universal Credit. Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror  She added that her son was offered another bed later - which Jack accepted - but claimed he was later told the bed was no longer available. Ms Schumann claimed they never received an explanation and no further attempts were made to offer Jack a bed. Following the inquest, a spokesman for the trust in charge of Prestwich Hospital said they had not had any contact at all with Jack Schumann. The coroner was told by Jacks family he made attempts to beat the addiction by himself, but by May  his health had deteriorated. Jack was found unresponsive by his twin brother on May , this year, and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.  His father, Martin Schumann, told the Heywood hearing on Tuesday: Jack lost his daughter about three years ago and suffered from depression ever since. I think he always blamed himself. He always liked a drink at home, but after her death he would tend to drink a lot. He was drinking about  cans a day. Jack got a job working with me and started to lay off a bit, but in the last  months he started to relapse again. It always got worse around the time of his daughters birthday or anniversary of her death. He adored his daughter and I dont think he ever got over her death. In the last few months he lost a lot of weight - probably about five stone. I last saw him on May  and he didnt look like himself. A postmortem conducted by Dr Abdul Gangrockwala revealed that Jack had died from an alcoholic fatty liver, due to excessive long-term alcohol consumption. He said that although Jacks liver was extensively diseased, the damage was reversible. A toxicology report did not detect any alcohol in Jacks system at the time of his death.  Ms Schumann told the hearing: Jack was offered a meeting at a local rehabilitation centre but it was just horrible. He felt very degraded even though he knew he needed help. We got a call to say that hed been offered a bed at Prestwich but on the same day he was facing eviction from his flat and had to have a meeting about Universal Credit. He was offered another place and he rung to tell me to get everything ready but just after they rang back again and said the bed had gone. We never got any explanation for it. After that there were no other attempts made to offer Jack a bed. In March he was doing really well and trying to cut down on the alcohol but a few weeks before his death his health started to deteriorate. In a statement read to the court, Jacks GP Dr Paul Richbell said the surgery were aware of his alcohol dependency. He said: Jack came to visit me in June  with an alcohol dependency problem and I spoke to him about the alcohol services and he self referred himself for support. He was seen by other doctors at the surgery who offered him advice and put him in touch with the local services.  Assistant Coroner for Manchester North Julie Robertson recorded a conclusion of natural causes. She said: It is clear that Jack used alcohol as a coping strategy. The disease to his liver was extensive and had accumulated over a number of years. I cannot speculate as to whether more available help could have prevented Jacks death. After the hearing Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Prestwich Hospital, said they had not had any contact with Jack Schumann.The Mirror is urging our readers to back our petition to stop the rollout Universal Credit which is plunging families into debt and despair and replace it with a fair system."},{"url":null,"title":"halloween weather forecast met office","story":"NewsHalloween weather forecast: Met Office revealstrick or treating is a good idea where you liveHalloween trick or treaters are advised to wrap up warm and dry as the Met Office predicts a wet and near-freezing nightShareByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video here-halloween-weather-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTonight is Halloween and this evening tens of thousands of children will be roaming the streets in spooky outfits on the prowl for chocolate and sweets.

But where did the spooky day come from and why do we celebrate it  The spookiest time of the year isnt just a time for kids to dress up and trick or treat. Its thought Halloween started with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would wear costumes and roam to ward of ghosts, but its down to Pope Gregory IIIs decree in the eight century that we celebrate it as we do. Why do we celebrate Halloween  Samhainmarked the end of summer and the harvest and heralded in the colder months. Celts believed that on the night before the new year the boundaries between world of the living and the dead become blurred. Traditionally people wore costumes, animal skins and heads and attempted to tell each others fortunes. By  AD the Roman Empire had conquered most of the Celtic territory and over the years of their reign they combined their festivals with the Celtics. The first was Feralia, a day late in October where Romans marked the passing of the dead. The second was Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruits and trees. The symbol for Pomona is an apple - and people see this as the reason bobbing apples became a tradition associated with Halloween. It was in  AD that Christianity changed the festival to add praying for the dead.  The Pope designated November  as a time to honour the saints and martyrs, a holiday that became known as All Saints Day. The day took on some of the Samhain traditions. The evening became known as All Hallows Eve - Halloween. The next day, November , is All Souls Day, when the dead are remembered. To Christians, All Souls Day is a time for people to pray for the dead. The tradition was based on the idea of purgatory - a stage between heaven and hell. It also begins the month of the dead, which takes place in November in the Christian tradition.  It was thought Christians were trying to make the day a sanctioned Church holiday but All Souls Day kept many of the Samhain traditions. Over time its become a secular festival best known for children donning costumes and masks to scare others witless and garner treats. Of course, the tradition made its way to America. By the nineteenth century, with the influx of immigrants, Halloween took over most of the country. Americas would visit neighbours and ask for food which later became known as trick or treating.  While Halloween went out of fashion in the s and was seen as a pagan belief, it wasnt long before it ed and became what we know and celebrate today. Around the world, many countries have their own weird Halloween traditions - and some of them are downright bizarre - and theres no end of urban myths designed to freak you out.We have rounded up some terrying Halloween tales as well as the origins behind some of the most well known traditions on October .  You might think putting on a mask is just for the kids, but it was actually adopted by pagans in the community during Samhain to scare off evil spirits. What started out as animal skins and heads has turned into something a little less gruesome now. It was hoped that wandering spirits seeing people in their weird disguises would assume they were also spirits - and let them go free. . Jack OLanterns were originally made from turnips  The British tradition of carving a scary face into a vegetable was originally done with turnips. When Irish immigrants took the idea of the Jack OLantern to America, they started using pumpkins, because they were cheaper than turnips. The legend of Stingy Jack inspired the carving. He trapped the Devil, only letting him go on the condition that Jack would never go to Hell. However, when he died, Jack learned that Heaven was out due to his devilish dealings, so he was condemned to wander the earth as a ghost for all eternity. Gted Jack a lump of burning coal by the Devil, Jack carried it round in a carved-out turnip to light his way. . Halloween decoration or a real live body - people have made mistakes  You might think that the skeleton decorations are all a bit of fun, but in , a postman thought a corpse was part of the Halloween display - but it was actually the resident of the house, who had died. Dale Porch was coming back from working the overnight sht on November , when he collapsed on the porch steps. The -year-olds family was distraught and felt the postman should have done something. . If you bite into a Halloween cake and hit a thimble, youll be unlucky in love  Part of the Halloween tradition in colonial America involved the baking of a Halloween cake. Bakers would hide ious things in the cake to tell the future. A thimble was a symbol of bad luck with the ladies or gentlemen. Also, presumably, a sign that youve got a costly visit to the dentist in your near future.

Punkie Night - Somersets own deeply creepy Halloween celebration The villages of Hinton St George and Lopen in Somerset have their very own twist on Halloween, and its dead creepy. Historically, the tradition involved children marching around with jack olanterns - or punkies - begging for candles and money, and threatening those who wouldnt cough up. So far, so trick-or-treat, right  Well, what makes it extra sinister, is the fact that this band of marauding youngsters is generally led by a Punkie King and Punkie Queen - and they sing a song. The song goes: Its Punkie Night tonight Its Punkie Night tonight Adam and Eve would not believe Its Punkie Night tonight. And heres how it sounds - as performed by Carl Turney and Brian Campbell from the band Clinic.  Shudder. . Michael Myers mask in the movie Halloween was the face of William Shatner  Since the film had an incredibly low budget, the prop department on horror classic Halloween had to dress serial killer Michael Myers in the cheapest mask they could find in their local fancy dress shop. Turns out that was a mask of William Shatner, which cost them the princely sum of . They modied it a bit, spray painted it white and made it a bit scarier and it became one of the iconic images of horror cinema. The cheapo slasher went on to take m at the worldwide box office, more than  times its , budget. That makes it the most profitable film ever to feature William Shatners face, beating Star Trek II and Miss Congeniality. Shatner also claims to have gone trick-or-treating in the mask of his own face.  They celebrate Halloween in Germany, but as a time to honour and respect the dead. One tradition is to hide all the knives in the house, for fear that ing spirits might injure themselves on any knives that are left out. There are a number of logical problems with this tradition - not least of which is that ghosts tend to be dead already, so how much damage can a kne realistically do  Butyou start applying logic to the idea of the dead walking the Earth... . If youre in Italy, you can enjoy the Beans of the Dead  In Italy they have a traditional Halloween recipe, which is kind of an oval cookie a bit like a macaron.

In reality almost every case of Halloween candy tampering has been performed by a family member. For example, there was the case of Ronald OBryan, who laced his sons sweets with cyanide in Texas in . Or the case in Detroit in , where -year-old Kevin Toston died of a heroin overdose after he found his uncles stash of the drug. His family later sprinkled heroin over his Halloween candy to try and protect his uncle. In the cases of foreign objects hidden in sweets - like needles or razor blades - all but a handful have been hoaxes, or the media jumping on a story which turned out to be untrue. There was, however, the case in Manchester of a -year-old man who was giving out baggies of cocaine to kids instead of sweets - though he didnt hide it in any sweets, police said hed given the items in error. . Urban myths come from somewhere - probably your home town Like the one about the poisoned sweets, urban myths are re and Halloween seems the perfect time to share them.

Just over a year later - Larners caravan was raided by police in Greatstone, Kent - who discovered a haul of amphetamines, weighing g.  He pleaded guilty to possessing the drug at Canterbury Crown Court, but denied intending to sell the Class B drug to others. Larner was released from hospital after  days with more than  stitches to his head, ear, arms and hands. His heroism prompted members of the public to donate pound, to get the south Londoner back on his feet.  He gained his fame after shouting f*** you, Im Millwall during the  attack as he grappled with Islamic terrorists. A petition was even set up online to award him the St George’s Cross - with fans praising him around the world. He will face a one-day trial in February next year and was granted bail until the next hearing.

Mandy said she only popped into Morrisons to use the bathroom when she spotted a lone scratchcard in the rack. She said: I saw one in the rack on its own and decided I wanted that one. It turned out it was a winner. I thought I had won pound but realised there was a combo.  “I rubbed my eyes and checked closely, rubbed my eyes and checked again. I realised there was a couple more zeros. It was pound,.” Mandy burst into tears immediately in the car and rang her mum to tell her the exciting news. “I was crying to start with, so my mum thought it was some bad news about my daughter”. Mandys mum, Marilyn, was also shocked to hear that she had scooped the jackpot prize. Mandy called her daughter, Hannah, who did not believe the news when she was told at first, thinking her mum was having a joke.  Mandy celebrated with her family at the curry house Rajhashi on Tewkesbury High Street, Glos. “I was looking around wonderinganyone knew that I had won or that something exciting was going on.” “My daughter finally believed me when I showed her the winning scratchcard”. As of yet, Mandy is undecided with what she will do with her unexpected windfall. Im just taking some time out, letting it all sink in and then Ill make some decisions in a few weeks time.  “I paid off a few bills, bought a new three-piece suite but haven’t thought that far ahead”.

Many have kindly given them presents - including gts such as teddies for their unborn baby, who is due to arrive in spring .Theyve received some odd gts, too. Meghan looked shocked when she was handed a bunch of carrots in Sydney before excitedly telling Harry: Weve got veggies! The carrots were later pictured on the floor with other items given to the couple.  But what exactly happens next  Are they allowed to keep the gts and do they use them  Although each gt-giver would love to think Harry and Meghan will cherish their present forever, they cant possibly use them all. Any present handed to the Duke and Duchess while they are shaking hands at public engagements is classed as an official gt. Every single gt handed to any royal on an official engagement is recorded on a form in order to keep track of them. According to the royal family website, these gts do not become the private property of Meghan and Harry - or any member of royalty who receives them.  The Duke and Duchess presents fall into the official category as they are given by iniduals not personally known to the Member of The Royal Family during walkabouts. If perishable gts with a value of less than pound - like the carrots Meghan was handed in Australia - are not to be personally used by the royalMeghan isnt going to put them into a stew then they may be given to charities or third parties to avoid waste. Third parties include the royals staff, so Meghan could technically pass those carrots on to her royal aides.  Perishable gts with a value over pound which wont be used by the royal recipient should pass to charity. Non-perishable official gts, when not used by the recipient or passed to charity, are stored - and once its in storage, things get a little bit more complicated... These stored gts are reviewed annually by a  of experts from the Royal Household and Royal Collection, who consider each gt in terms of its national, historical, aesthetic or financial value. Then they decide what happens to each gt, which can be:Kept in storage Incorporated into the Royal CollectionLoaned to a reputable and appropriate organisation Donated to a registered charity Destroyedit is not to be retained, loaned or donated to charityGts falling into the first two categories are supposed to be retained for five years. Iniduals and organisations meeting the royal family on official engagements are discouraged from offering extravagant gts. It is not known what the couple will do with all the teddies and baby gts they are being given. They might choose to keep some of them, but as there are so many its likely theyll decide to give some to an appropriate charity so others can benefit from the generosity of their fans.

Mercedes, who is eight months pregnant, said: Meghan said that shewas beautul, and asked her for a hug. We were trying to mime hugging in the background. We were just so excited to see her.  People started queuing hours before the royal party arrived and among the signs was one saying Fancy a cuppa, Megs  I have banana bread, while another said Hello your royal bumpness. As well as the array of flowers and soft toys, the couple also received a typically Kiwi present during the walkabout. A group of children were there from Glenholme School and caught the attention of Harry and Meghan by performing their school version of the haka when the couple approached.

She also took along some Royal Blend tea from Londons Fortnum and Mason.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have now completed their trip, which included a whopping  engagements, and can safely step out of the spotlight again having made no major slip-ups. Meghan, who is thought to be around four months pregnant, has dazzled in gorgeous dresses, sparkling jewels and sweetly cradled her growing baby bump. She and Harry have also broken royal tradition by embracing adults and kids in huge hugs on the tour. But an etiquette expert has called her out on one little habit she has, calling it unprofessional and too relaxed.  It came after Meghan and Harry visited Courtenay Creative, which runs programmes for young people to get into film, and the Duchess wore a white tuxedo dress with pockets she couldnt resist putting her hands in. William Hanson told the Daily Mail: “We know that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pioneering a new, relaxed, tactile branch of monarchy but having hands in the pocket is a step too far. “There is good casual and there is bad casual. Placing hands in the pocket is too relaxed and unprofessional, however dressed down Prince Harry and his we may have been.”  Meghan shouldnt be too worried, though, as Hanson believes its just a small blip - a habit she can change next time. Will the world end  he said. No. It is just a small blip in Meghan’s usually delightful manners that can be easily corrected for future engagements.” Body language expert Judi James explained Prince Charles and Prince Harry are also fans of putting their hands in their pockets, but Meghan is the only royal woman to do it too. She also revealed the reason the Duchess has adopted the unprofessional habit.  “The classic reason for this very common gesture is that it signals a subliminal desire to hide, especially when the hands are shoved deep into the pockets, Judi told OK! “It also helps get over the common problem most of us suffer from, which is not really knowing what to do with our hands when we know people are looking at us.

Devastated Julia Pence was beside herself when son Braylen Carwell had a seizure and the left side of his body went limp. He then became disoriented, wasn’t able to focus and didn’t know where he was. The youngster was rushed to hospital near his father Cambrays home in Galion, Ohio, where he tested positive for methamphetamines. Julia and Cambray are blaming the terrying incident on something they think their son picked up while out trick or treating - potentially some fake vampire teeth.  And they urged parents in the area to throw away the sweets their children had recieved. Braylen, who is now recovering at home, told TV: I was putting my socks on and then I started to shiver. And then I couldnt move my arm or my fingers. Until I got to the doctors and I was sitting for a little bit and then I could move my hand but not my fingers. Braylen said he didnt eat anything and only put the fake teeth in. Police have sent Braylens Halloween goodies to be tested - including the vampire teeth he put in his mouth moments before getting sick. Fortunately officers have received no other reports of this nature.  Julia said: Police have came and taken a report and took the candy for investigation. Chief of police came personally from home to talk to us. And there is an open ongoing investigation. I never thought this would happen to my child, but this is real and there are sick people in this world. I’m counting my blessing cause it could have been a lot worse or something stronger. My baby sure has been a trooper through this whole thing. Julia, who admitted that she and Braylens father are recovering drug addicts, said there is no other way apart from the trick or treat goodies that he would have come into contact with the meth.  The mum, who has been sober for three years, insisted she was not covering up the truth following backlash. She added: Its your duty to protect your children from everything. You cant protect them from everything. You just have to be aware and do the best that you can. Galion Police Department confirmed it was investigating the incident. It said: Please check your childrens candy that was received today while trick or treating. Also, please check any non-candy items such as rings, bracelets, necklaces or fake teeth. If you suspect that anything has been tampered with, please contact our department by phone so that an officer can stop and collect the items.  Meanwhile, Dublin Police Department in Georgia is warning parents to be on the lookout for methamphetamine pills that have been stamped to look like candy. The drugs are small and come in a iety of shapes including stars, circles and hearts. The photograph posted by police showed blue, green, grey and yellow tablets. The police department added: Please look through your child candies during this holiday season. Any suspicions, please call our office or  to report. If shared with other counties, please contact your local police department or Sherfs Department.

She says she sat in a chair, where her arms and feet were fixed and a metallic tube was placed on her head.  An electric current then ran through her body, she told ApexTV in an interview.

Describing what she could see, she said: The ground was entirely green with trees and flowers, skyscrapers were peeking out of the trees. One of the most interesting facts was that plants were not similar to those which we used to see because of genetic engineering. Also I wanted to say that there were a lot of animals. Walking around I saw cats and foxes. I saw snakes and slithers in the plants of skyscrapers.

Chloe tells the camera the plant kept its freshness as she tore it up with roots and came back and planted it in a laboratory.She reveals the plant is evidence of her time travel and proof it wasnt a delusion.  Describing the skyscrapers, she says they are made of unusual metallic material surrounded by plants.Everywhere was electric current, she adds. There were no gas, no petrol and such kind of things which polluted the environment.Beginning from  year, there will be no such profession as a policeman as people at birth would be inserted a chip into the eye. So in a case of crime it would be immediately revealed in seconds. Chloe goes on to say how she saw unknown creatures swimming in a lake that were like people.

Sue had previously met Princess Anne in the s and was particularly excited to meet her nephew. The Year Two teacher was with a group of children from Glenholme School, who caught the attention of Harry and Meghan by performing their school version of the haka when the couple walked passed.  As the duke approached Sue, people from behind egged her on and encouraged her to go for it. But Harry was not as keen and joked: Oh no, I cant do that. I might get into trouble. Meanwhile, a two-year-old also crept through the railings during Harry and Meghans final tour walkabout - and was rewarded with a hug from the duchess. Catalina Rivera and her mother Mercedes were among the well-wishers at Rotoruas Government Gardens, having moved to New Zealand  months ago from El Salvador. As Catalinas first language is Spanish, the duchess had dficulty communicating with the youngster at first.  Mercedes, who is eight months pregnant, said: Meghan said that shewas beautul, and asked her for a hug. We were trying to mime hugging in the background. We were just so excited to see her. People started queuing hours before the royal party arrived and among the signs was one saying Fancy a cuppa, Megs  I have banana bread, while another said Hello your royal bumpness. As well as the array of flowers and soft toys, the couple also received a typically Kiwi present during the walkabout. Harry finished the royal tour with five sweet words as he said goodbye with Meghan.  The tour has been a huge test for the pair and is their first as a married couple. They kicked off their -day trip by announcing they are expecting their first child, and since then theyve packed in  engagements in four dferent countries. But its now all come to an end, and the couple are saying their goodbyes as they prepare to head back to London. As they finished their final engagement at Redwoods Tree Walk in Rotorua, New Zealand, they said farewell to media as they were walking out of the forest and Harry said a final five words.  When asked how he found the tour, he replied: Its been great. Thanks guys. Meghan and Harry started their final day with a traditional Pōwhiri welcoming ceremony. They were both given Korowai, Maori cloaks which are intended to protect the wearer, which had been made especially for them. Harry was also presented with a Tewha Tewha, a Maori weapon with a point at one end and an axe at the other. Trevor Maxwell, of the local district council, said I am sure you are going to Twickenham when the All Blacks play England on November  - make sure you dont take that.  The ceremony was conducted in Maori – as Harry and Meghan were being treated like “one of their own” – with Monty Morrison only breaking into English once, when he looked at the duchess and said “little bump” to laughter. Prince Harry then spoke for around a minute in Maori – with gasps of awe and smiles when he used the word whaiaipo, or sweetheart. He said: Thank you for the beautul cloak you have so kindly gted to myself and the duchess. We appreciate the skill of the weavers who made it, and the aroha that has gone into its creation. This cloak is a taonga that will be cherished in our family.  One of the joys of our visit to New Zealand has been the opportunity to meet so many young New Zealanders who are devoting their talents and energy to making a dference. There are creative, gted and caring Te Arawa Rangatahihere, who are using their talents to preserve and promote the Māori language, to support mental wellbeing, and to achieve in areas that will benefit their communities, and their country. They also had the chance to meet two baby kiwi chicks at the Rainbow Springs breeding centre before heading out to meet hundreds of well-wishers who had gathered to greet them.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend. The fans were right with us until the last minute.“It does help, it makes a massive dference and Dunfermline isn’t too far down the road so I’d expect another good away following.“I think the fans can see the work and effort we’re putting in, evenwe didn’t get the three points last Saturday.“The fans have been great and long may it continue.”Allan Johnston’s Pars have been struggling of late after a lightning fast start to the season saw them follow up four wins from four in the Betfred Cup group stage with an impressive - victory at Tannadice.Since then, Dunfermline have only managed eight points from the following eight games and were beaten - at home last weekend despite dominating against Queen of the South.In fact, scoring goals at home has been a real problem of late with just the two Championship strikes going in.Booth  Co., however, are wary of a repeat show from the Pars.He said: “Dunfermline were really good at Tannadice the first time we played them and thoroughly deserved to win.“I think most people would be surprised they’ve not kicked on from that first game.“They played well that day and deserved the win.“I’ve not seen much of them since but it’s not worked out for them since for whatever reason.“They’ll still be a dangerous opponent, though, because they are, obviously, capable of putting in a performance but have just been a bit inconsistent recently.“If we go about it like we have done in the last two games then we’ll give ourselves a chance.“We’ll be going there in positive spirits, try to take our chances and come back up the road with the three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd82bf80afb8-e1540910638812-380x564.jpg ","title":"cat returned to dundee family after an incredible five years on the run","story":"A Dundee family are over the moon after finding their pet cat in a shelter – five years after he disappeared.Christine Ritchie and her son Charlie were distraught when black and white moggie Curtis went out and never came back after they moved house.The Ritchies moved from the Blackness Road area to Stobswell five years ago, when Curtis was three and a half years old.According to Christine, however, he was not a fan of Stobbie and left to go back to the West End – not just once, but twice.She said: “We kept Curtis indoors for a while and then, when we let him out, he just disappeared.“We got him back and kept him in for a couple of weeks but then he disappeared again and that was it.”The family searched high and low, night after night, after Curtis failed to reappear, and eventually resigned themselves to the fact they might never see him again.Charlie, , was devastated, having looked after the cat since he was born.However, recently there was a surprise on Facebook’s Missing Pets Dundee and Angus page – a cat which looked just like Curtis had been found.The Facebook post read: “Do you recognise ‘Earl’  He is a big black and white boy who was found straying in the Dundee area.“We suspect Earl has been straying for some considerable time, perhaps years.“He is approachable and keen on treats.”Earl was taken in temporarily but later escaped from his foster home, before being taken in by Cats Protection Scotland, which has a shelter on Foundry Lane.Christine and Charlie went in at the weekend to seeEarl was really Curtis.Christine said: “Charlie was as happy as anything, even though Curtis hissed a bit at first, but after a while he settled.“It’s overwhelming to think he was out there for all this time.“My phone’s been ringing non-stop with people wanting to come over and see him. It’s been like finding a long-lost member of the family again.”The Ritchies believe Curtis survived thanks to the kindness of strangers and by fending for scraps but they will never know for certain.Nor will they know how Curtis travelled across Dundee without getting hurt, but the family will be keeping a very close eye on him from now on.Christine added: “Charlie’s been checking on him every  minutes to make sure he doesn’t disappear again.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd82d8c8e8c0-821x564.jpg ","title":"dundee gaffer says belief is key if dark blues have any hope of a result against celtic","story":"‘Start like you mean to go on’ is an over-used cliche but it’s exactly what boss Jim McIntyre wants from his side against Celtic tonight – providing they begin a lot better than they did in the - loss to Hearts.Last week at Dens, the Dark Blues were behind within two minutes after conceding a sloppy free-kick and immediately gave themselves an uphill struggle. One which ended in an easy victory for the Jambos.Tonight they welcome champions Celtic fresh off a - win of their own over that same Hearts team in the Betfred Cup semi-final on Sunday.It’s fair to say the odds are not in Dundee’s favour but that won’t stop the Dens gaffer giving his team the belief they can cause an upset.To get anything, though, he knows they can’t afford another sloppy start to the game.He said: “It’s so important to give ourselves a chance at the start.“Until Hearts scored their second goal, we did a lot of things good in the game though nobody seems to be interested in that.“We got into some good positions but didn’t punish them and lost another silly goal.“You think you have all the men in place to deal with it but you don’t.“It is very important we start the game well and grow into the game, that’s always the case whenever you play the Old Firm.“That is the aim, to get off to a good start.“I was at Murrayfield on Sunday and I thought Hearts were excellent for  minutes until the penalty but that’s what Celtic do – they constantly pose you questions.“Your concentration levels have to be tip-top and I felt after they got their goal that fluency they have came back.“Celtic are starting to hit their top level and you could see that with the quality of the goals.“To be able to keep that concentration level for -plus minutes is very, very dficult.“To beat them you have to have your organisation levels spot on, you’ve got to have one to  playing out of their skin and you hope a few of them aren’t quite at their peak.“It’s like anything, the favourites don’t always win and that’s the belief you have to go into the game with.“I’ve been at other clubs where we’ve gone and got a result against them and that’s the belief you’ve got to carry against them.“Equally, having said that, you know you are going to have to do everything really well and hope a few of their players are off it.”By the time January comes around, expectations are there will be a raft of changes in the Dens squad.However, Jim insists every player at his disposal right now will get the chance to show he’s good enough to help the side get out of relegation trouble.For the new gaffer, though, it’s not just about showing you’ve the ability to play at this level, it’s about proving you have the character to do so, too.He added: “I think this squad, with no disrespect to the Ross County squad that I inherited, definitely has more ability within it overall.“Ability alone isn’t enough – you’ve got to be able to do the hard yards and carry your job out. That is so important and good teams will punish youyou don’t.“It’s so important to have a good shape about you and do your jobs well at this level.“We have seen what happens when you drop runners at set-plays and give away silly free-kicks.“I think there is plenty of character in this dressing-room but it’s about knowing what’s required of you and standing up to do it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new midfielder could figure for dundee in celtic clash","story":"Boss Jim McIntyre could have more selection options available when his team face champions Celtic at Dens Park on Wednesday.However, he’ll still have at least a couple of men out injured.Full-back Nathan Ralph and centre-half Genseric Kusunga were not ready to face Hearts on Tuesday evening.Both, though, have been back in training this week and that could put them in contention for a place against the Hoops next midweek.Midfielder Martin Woods, who’s been training at Dens this week, could also be handed a contract in time for involvement in the next outing.However, the likes of Paul McGowan and Josh Meekings are expected to remain on the sidelines as they continue their battles to get back fit after y absences.The club are expected to announce McIntyre’s assistant later today."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bd82d743d01e-463x564.jpg ","title":"tom duthie dundee uniteds high pressing game can only click if every player is working hard","story":"A feature of Dundee United under Robbie Neilson has been the high-pressing game he’s introduced since taking over early this month.Under previous boss Csaba Laszlo, the Tangerines tended to be a side who dropped off and retreated inside their own half when they lost possession.The key to that strategy was not to give other teams the ball and, for a while, the game stats were showing Laszlo’s United were dominating it.As time passed and things started going wrong, increasingly that became a problem. Other outfits in the Championship quickly worked out while getting the ball quickly was an option,that wasn’t on they’d have time to get the ball under control and pass their way up the pitch.As Partick Thistle, Inverness Caley Thistle and now Dunfermline have discovered, it’s been all change under the new manager.When his team lose the ball they will work hard, fast and high up the pitch to get it back as quickly as possible.That brought them their goals in Robbie’s opening game at Firhill, when for both strikes home players actually had good possession in their own half but were caught out by the speed with which they were closed down.And in the draw against ICT and in Saturday’s win over the Pars, a feature of United’s play was the number of times they won the ball back in, or near, the opponent’s defensive third.Watching from the stands, what is striking about the new policy is the amount of ground it involves the attacking players covering. At the sharp end has been Pavol Safranko. Fortunately for United, as well as being a talented goalscorer, the Slovakian prides himself on his work-rate.At the weekend he almost literally ran himself into the ground – going down with cramp in injury time and being forced off.Not far behind have been the attacking midfield trio of Paul McMullan, Fraser Aird and Billy King. As well as being expected to get forward and get on the ball, there is little respite for them when the other team’s defenders have it.Delighted as he’s been with that quartet’s attitude to a side of the game creative players do not always relish, Robbie stressed the system only works and will continue to,every outfield player buys into it.One chink in the armour though and he knows it will fall apart, allowing the other team to find men with space and time to hurt United.“Pavol’s been great. I know that he’s a very good player and, as I’ve said, I knew about him before I came here because I’d seen him play at Aalborg ,” said the gaffer.“But we also have McMullan, King, Aird, the boys behind, doing a lot of running as well.“And I’m a big believer that when we go and press, even when we’re attacking, the defence have got a big role to play in it as well.“If we’re asking forward players to go and run , ,  yards to go and press people, then the midfielders and defenders have to do it as well.“There is a responsibility on them to go and do it as well. As a team we are getting better at it, but it’s early days, we’re only three games in.”That note of caution possibly stems from the fact, although he’s been pleased with the way the players have taken to the tactic, the next couple of weeks could provide sterner tests of it.Partick and the Pars have been struggling for form and while Inverness remain the only unbeaten second tier team, as five of them in a row indicates, they have become the draw specialists of the ision.Up next are Queen of the South and leaders Ross County, two sides who might just be better equipped to cope with the high press."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie neil mccann tried to change too much too soon at dundee","story":"When Neil McCann looks back on his time as Dundee boss he will surely learn several lessons, ones that can stand him in good steadhe s to management.Perhaps the most obvious will be that, whatever your football philosophy, it has to be tapered to suit the resources you have available when it comes to players.McCann’s mantra at Dens was to play passing football at all times and, ultimately, at all costs. That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"end-of-british-summertime-when-do-the-clocks-go-back-this-month","story":"The end of British Summertime is officially approaching, which, despite the gloom, brings one positive development ndash an extra hour in bed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicole-scherzinger-speaks-out-after-telling-tess-daly-off-for-sitting-too-close-to-her","story":"Nicole Scherzinger has addressed speculation she had an awkward encounter with Tess Daly on Strictly Come Dancing."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-call-it-out-campaign-hosts-public-meeting","story":"A CAMPAIGN has been launched in Glasgow to tackleanti-Irish and anti-Catholic hate crime."},{"url":null,"title":"bellahouston-park-hospice-to-be-named-in-honour-of-sir-arnold-clark","story":"A NEW state-of-the-art hospice has opened its doors in Glasgows south side for the first time today - and will be named inhonour of a famous Scot."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-chef-john-quigley-cooking-up-festive-treats-for-christmas-event","story":"CELEBRITY chef John Quigley is leaving his award-winning Glasgow restaurant to share festive cooking tips at a popular Christmas event."},{"url":null,"title":"world-of-preservation-as-glasgow-museum-store-opens-up-its-doors","story":"These captivating behind-the-scenes pictures show a vast collection of , taxidermy animals at a museum resource centre."},{"url":null,"title":"ryan-christie-was-too-skinny-but-now-hes-man-enough-to-be-a-celtic-player","story":"BRENDAN Rodgers feared a gust of wind would be too strong an opponent for Ryan Christie when he first saw the Highlander."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-sisters-not-getting-a-penny-from-dads-estate-is-it-legal","story":"My Dad passed away, and among other things, my brother who dealt with the funeral and the insurance and money is saying that two of our sisters are not getting a penny of the estate.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

Scottish Parliament yesterday .Universal Credit was introduced as part of the UK Governments overhaul of the welfare system.Critics say cuts to payments and widespread problems with its implementation have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been better suited to the pages of a Dickens novel.\"And to suggest that poverty should be a barrier to a family, that people who are poor are not entitled to any more than two children - what an absolutely disgraceful position.\"Ms Ballantynes words were also met with anger in Westminster today.Pete Wishart, the SNPs shadow leader of the House of Commons, told Parliament: \"We dont want these th century, Tory, Victorian values in Scotland.\"There were simply appalling remarks in the Scottish Parliament yesterday when the Conservatives social security spokesperson, Michelle Ballantyne, said on the two-child benefit cap that it is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like.\"A comment that has simply appalled and shocked mainstream opinion in Scotland.The condemnation has come from across party ides.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard describing Ms Ballantynes words as abhorrent, nasty and archaic.He added: \"The reality is that the Scottish Tories stand behind every blow of austerity and every cruel welfare cut that has been implemented by the UK Tory government - from the bedroom tax to the rape clause.\"These comments should be retracted and Michelle Ballantyne should apologise.\""},{"url":null,"title":"birthday-encore-for-choir-in-barcelona","story":"A BIRTHDAY trip to Barcelona was the icing on the cake for Peebles community choir InChorus.The choir has been celebrating its tenth birthday this autumn and members have just ed from an exciting long weekend of performances and appearances in the Catalonian city.The choirrsquos programme of main events began in the wonderful Palau De La Musica Catalana - a UNESCO World Heritage Site of extraordinary beauty, the modernistic design and decoration of which is quite unique.After a tour of the building, choir members were askedthey would like to sing on the main stage.Choir manager, Lorna Turnbull told us: ldquoThe design of the Palau is mind blowing and the acoustics are amazing.\"We were told that we could sing just one song, but having heard us, we were asked to sing another.\"This happened on the first morning of the trip, and I was afraid that everything  we had planned for the weekend would be an anti-climax. I neednrsquot have worried. Barcelona did us proud.The next major event took place in the beautul old church of Sant Gaieta in the Eixample District of the city, where the priest raises money for an African mission by staging regular quality concerts.A large, very discerning, audience took the choir to its heart, with many of them coming backstage to express their thanks.The following day InChorus travelled to Sabadell, north of Barcelona, where they were introduced to Coral Catasons, a contemporary choir of similar size.The choirs performed a joint concert to a full house, receiving a standing ovation, with some excellent hospitality from the Spanish choir and some hilarious Catalonian entertainment for afters.Friendships were formed on the back of which Coral Catasons has announced its intention to visit Peebles and the wider Scottish Borders next June.The final scheduled event was an hour-long performance on the steps of the magnicent Barcelona Cathedral.Lorna added: \"To stand in such a location singing in the sunshine to a fantastic audience was extraordinary. The choir loved it.\"On the plane to Catalonia - at the suggestion of the pilot - and at other points throughout the trip, the choir took the opportunity to sing whenever and wherever they could, especially in the beautul squares and open spaces of the Gothic Quarter around La Rambla.As the days progressed, whether singing or sight seeing, members were recognised increasingly.Men in kilts are an instant attraction, and this, combined with the gentsrsquo Catalonian coloured bright teeshirts bearing a line in Spanish from lsquoHavanarsquo, a piece from the choirrsquos repertoire, ensured a positive response everywhere.In the course of the few days they were congratulated and spoken to by people from all around the world including South America, the United States, Canada, all over Europe, Russia, India, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.To cap this there was the warm welcome extended to the choir by the Spanish people.Accompanying the choir through all its derring-do was the InChorus mascot, Singu, a penguin given to the choir by the family of the late Celia Hayton, a much loved choir member.Musical Director, Aly Skidmore, added: ldquoInChorus decided over a year ago that Barcelona would be the perfect city in which to properly celebrate its first decade.\"The culture there embraces all the arts, but music particularly. The choir worked hard to master an extensive repertoire of both sacred and secular pieces which could be performed in any venue or outdoor space.\"The response from our audiences reflected appreciation of the achievement of this choir from the Scottish Borders."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-praise-galashiels-tot-bens-fundraising-efforts","story":"MPs have praised the fundraising efforts of

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community.

He had major announcements to make, on the abolition of PFI and a tax on digital companies to name but two, but these could have been delivered at any time.As a result, he sounded less like a Chancellor delivering a coherent Budget than a politician filling time before the main event. For once, we do not mean the next Tory leadership contest. The main event, the only event, last month, next month, and for the foreseeable future, is Brexit.When he did refer to the UK exiting the EU on March  next year it was to say he was putting slightly more money into the pot to deal with contingencies. The only nod to the enormity of what will soon be taking place was when he referred to the possibility of upgrading next yearrsquos Spring Statement to a ldquofull fiscal eventnecessary.In other words, should the UK look like it will crash out of the EU without a deal ndash good, bad, or middling ndash Mr Hammond may have to revise his plans entirely. How he squares this with promises that the spending increases announced yesterday will go ahead regardless of the Brexit deal is dficult to see. A no deal Brexit will change everything, utterly.Why, then, was Mr Hammond, and before him Theresa May, the Prime Minister, so keen to frame this as an end of austerity Budget  Mrs May had shown the way in her party conference speech when she said austerity ldquois over. Mr Hammond preferred to cast things slightly further into the future, saying austerity was coming to an end. Beginning of the end, or the end of the beginning, both were sending a message that after a decade of thorny times, a rosier era lay ahead.For those living with the consequences of austerity, all this talk of consigning the policy to history will seem like a joke in the poorest of taste. Such has been the extent of the cuts in public spending and the lack of real, consistent growth in wages, that it could take a generation at least until people are back to the position they were in ten years ago. Those at the sharp end of benefit changes and public spending cuts, happening here and now, have every right to wonder why anyone should be talking about an end to austerity when they are living with its effects day in, day out.Looked at from a dferent angle, this Budget did have clear aim. Its first, and least important purpose, was to show the Chancellor was still alive and well. For Mr Hammond, who has had more of a no profile lately than a low one, this was his chance to show that he remains a force to be reckoned with should the party war between hard Brexiters and Remainers take a turn for the even nastier. This weekrsquos Budget has allowed Mr Hammond to present himself as a man with a plan and this Government as an administration working towards an orderly and successful Brexit. The message to Conservative MPs is clear: do not wreck this. Stop fighting for a deal that is not there to be had, work with us on Brexit, and all of this economic bounty can be ours. More spending with no need for tax rises, the impossible made possible due to healthy economic growth, the kind that only a soft landing Brexit can achieve.Much rests on Mr Hammondrsquos growth hopes. Yet even with forecasts revised slightly upwards, UK growth remains modest. The Chancellor spoke yesterday of a ldquojobs miracle. What he really needs is a productivity miracle and this Budget does nothing to bring that about.But that is long-term thinking, andthis Budget was anything it was a short-term fix, one designed to keep the warring Tory tribes together for fear that something worse will come along: a Labour Government. Mr Hammond had a lot to offer there too, however. He spoke of the Prime Minister stealing a couple of rabbits out of his hat by announcing money for the NHS and a continued freeze on fuel duty. Just as she had ldquoborrowed from him, so Mr Hammond reached into Labourrsquos policy pocket and helped himself to a pledge to abolish the Private Finance Initiative and introduce a tax on digital behemoths. The most daring theft of all was declaring an end to austerity. If the Conservatives can do all that and maintain fiscal discipline, why would anyone want to take a chance of Labour getting into power Mr Hammond sat down yesterday with the cheers of Tory backbenchers ringing in his ears. He clearly does not believe the old saw about Budgets that are received well initially becoming the ones that soon fall apart. He is right to be confident, because in the cold light of day this will seem like a Budget written on the air, a statement laced with promises and predictions that might come true, and might not. If they do not, Mr Hammond will escape blame. It is enough, from his point of view, to point the way to the sunlit uplands. How the country gets there is down to others. He has done his bit.He passes the parcel back to Mrs May and the music plays on, a little tinnier than before."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-images-of-leith-reveal-the-port-in-its-heyday","story":"THEY show Edinburghrsquos historic Port of Leith as it once was hardworking and bustling with ships on their way to the four corners of the globe.And for campaigners currently arguing against the increasing redevelopment of the area, they will bring a pang of regret for a once buoyant industrial age and tight-knit community that has gradually disappeared.Hundreds of fascinating images of a lost way of le in the capitalrsquos increasingly gentried and redeveloped quarter of Leith were discovered in Edinburghrsquos Central and Leith libraries, tucked inside more than a dozen painstakingly compiled volumes spanning decades.They had been gathered by local historian, Dr James Scott Marshall, who displayed remarkable foresight by saving dozens of photographs, postcards and newspaper cuttings depicting daily le in what was once Edinburghrsquos gateway to the globe.The forgotten images include grainy black and white photographs showing clusters of steamers and sailing ships at berth on The Shore - today a tourist hotspot and home to Michelin star restaurants, shops and galleries.Many capture the people of the port going about their business, either working in the once thriving shipyards, enjoying a game of golf on Leith Links, proudly showing off their Clydesdale horses or outside their shops.Some will remind Leithers of what once was ndash and what is on the way: images include workers laying tram tracks to link the port with the city centre.Others provide a captivating glimpse of long-lost buildings and once packed sugar and whisky bond warehouses which once defined the historic port and are now either upmarket homes or offices.The eclectic assortment of images and ephemera provides a snapshot of social history thatrsquos a world away from the portrsquos modern hipster image, with its trendy cafes, Michelin star restaurants and tourist attractions.The collection has now been repaired and digitised to create Leith Miscellany, an online exhibition currently featuring on Edinburgh Libraries, Museums and Galleriesrsquo Capital Collections website.Clare Padgett, a library development leader who worked on the  plus images, said that while some are familiar images from the likes of pioneering photographer David Octavius Hill, others havenrsquot been previously seen and there are no details of where they came from or who took them.ldquoThe collection is really quite erse, she says. ldquoSome images had some information written alongside, but in others we really have had nothing to go on.ldquoThey were kept in shop-bought photograph albums, almost like a scrapbook, with postcards and photographs alongside press cuttings.ldquoDr Marshall was well known in Leith and had written many books about the portrsquos history. Itrsquos possible he kept this collection as a research tool.ldquoThese are images we really should treasure.Dr Marshall was born in Leith in , and became minister of Kirkgate Church in . He was regarded as an authority on the area, and went on to complete a doctorate on the portrsquos history.He later moved to St Andrews, and died in , aged .Yet even he might struggle to recognise some elements of the ancient port today, which have seen it propelled from one of Edinburghrsquos lower cost areas to one of its most desirable.Indeed, itrsquos so dferent, that some have argued its regeneration has gone too far, with claims that the once gritty area known for its sense of community and unique role on the fringe of the capital has become lsquogentriedrsquo, its historic assets stripped by property developers and leisure groups.Recent debate in the port has raged over suggestions that local people are being lsquopushed outrsquo of the area by rising prices and new developments.Last year a Scottish Government-backed study of the area raised concerns over rising property prices and the impact on local people whose families had lived in Leith for generations, attempting to remain.The study findings, along with a controversial poundm plan for hotel, student accommodation and leisure facilities on Leith Walk, sparked a Save Leith Walk campaign which has attracted backing from writer Irvine Welsh, The Proclaimers and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Campaigners last month presented a , signature to Edinburgh City Council claiming development of the area will damage local business and unravel the arearsquos heritage and community.Meanwhile, there are even plans for a National Lottery-funded play, provisionally entitled Displaced, which is expected to explore the impact of development on the area. It is due to be staged next summer, to coincide with theof tramworks to the area.The online exhibition includes several photographs of Leithrsquos old tram network as well as steam engines waiting for passengers at Leith Central Station, which closed in .Councillor Ian Perry, Councillor Ian Perry, Education, Children and Families Convener, said: ldquoThis is a most interesting collection of images from Leithrsquos rich and ied past, dating as far back as the th century, and sheds light on so many aspects of the arearsquos social history."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-women-on-banknotes-have-the-power-to-improve-society","story":"The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less ldquotarnished. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBSrsquos ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its pound polymer note in , the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the pound version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue pound note.After nearly  years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just  years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only menrsquos achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of Englandrsquos  decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its pound notes: ldquoAn all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.Our towns and cities are full of images and symbols of what countless men have achieved, with the naming of streets and chiselling of statues conferring Men of History status on them in the process. Women have not been afforded this luxury and, with some exceptions that remain woefully few and far between, their many achievements have gone unnoticed. This was highlighted by Willow Tea Room Trust chair Celia Sinclair when she said at the launch of the new RBS pound note that while Kate Cranston was an ldquoexcellent businesswoman who changed attitudes, in her day she really wasnrsquot all that unusual. ldquoThere were many women like Kate Cranston around at that time, but history simply doesnrsquot remember them, Ms Sinclair noted.That society has been able to forget those and countless other women is damaging because while it risks giving women the impression that they have nothing to live up to, it also perpetuates the myth still believed by some men that they simply havenrsquot achieved anything worth commemorating in the first place. All little girls need positive role models to give them the belief that they can grow up to be whatever they want to be, but it is just as important for equality that little boys know that women fulfil important roles too. I hadnrsquot realised quite how important until the day my then three-year-old son, who up until that point had only ever been seen by a female GP, couldnrsquot get his head round the fact the doctor we were off to see was going to be a man. Seeing is believing, though, and after that visit he took me at my word when I said that, just like women, men too can be anything they want to be.Which is why it is so important that Nan Shepherd, Mary Somerville and Kate Cranston, whose histories show what women can achieve in the arts, science and business worlds, have not just been commemorated but have been commemorated in a way that ensures all of us will come into contact with their images again and again and again. As RBSrsquos Scottish chair Malcolm Buchanan said when he unveiled the Kate Cranston pound last week, the bank feels that ldquoa banknotersquos value is more than just the figure printed across its front - it is our symbol, which lives in peoplersquos pockets and touches everyday lives.A statue in a part of a town that a fraction of us will visit or a portrait on a wall that only some of us will pass by is one thing, but an image on a note that will fall out of birthday cards and get passed from person to person as we go about our daily lives has the potential to have a far greater impact on our collective consciousness.RBSrsquos inclusion of women on its notes may have come at a time when banks in general are making plans for a cashless society, but there are still tens of millions of them in circulation and it is no exaggeration to say that in an incremental way the move will help to make society better for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-insists-chancellors-give-away-budget-not-precursor-to-snap-general-election","story":"The Chancellor used Mondays statement to announce a pound billion loosening of the purse-strings with income tax breaks for  million voters, help with business rates for the High Street, support for Universal Credit and the promise of increased public spending over the coming years.The package prompted speculation that the Conservative Government was preparing the way for a snap poll to provide the Prime Minister with a solid Commons majority as Brexit comes into effect in the spring.Asked at a press conference in Oslo ndash where she is attending the Northern Future Forum - whether or not she was planning to ask voters to go back to the polls, Mrs May responded emphatically: \"No. We are not preparing for another general election.

He has abandoned any idea of getting to budget balance by the mid-s.\"Mr Johnson said there were big increases in NHS spending over the coming years but \"he hasnt found any money\" for other public services.Mr Hammond responded by noting how the budget deficit would decline in every year of the forecast period and declared: \"We retain an ambition to balance the budget.\"He dismissed suggestions that he had chopped down the \"magic money tree\" and burnt the lot.The Chancellor told Today: \"You are painting a picture here that is designed to show that Im abandoning fiscal rectitude. Im not.\"He defended his decision to increase income-tax thresholds in a way which benefited the wealthy more than the worse-off.Many middle-income workers in schools, hospitals and police services had been dragged into the higher rate of tax, noted Mr Hammond, adding: \"Its important to raise all of these thresholds.One effect of raising the p higher rate of tax threshold from next year to pound, for middle earners south of the border means the tax dferentials between England and Scotland are growing as the Scottish Government introduces its own rates and bands.Derek Mackay, the Scottish Finance Secretary, is due to give his Budget in December. He argued that his changes earlier this year to the Scottish tax system, including introducing a new p starter rate, made income tax north of the border more progressive.But his Conservative opponents complained that Scotland was already the ldquohighest taxed part of the UK and insisted the case for more SNP tax rises in the Scottish Government forthcoming Budget was unsustainable.Asked about the widening gap on income tax between Scotland and England, the PMrsquos spokeswoman simply referred reporters to the Treasury.Askedthere was any concern that the dfering tax systems across the border were weakening the Union, she pointed to a range of measures in the Budget, which benefited all corners of the UK.The policies announced in Mr Hammonds third economic statement amounted to a poundbn loosening of the purse-strings over a six-year period.But the spectre of a no-deal Brexit hung over the -minute speech with the Office for Budget Responsibility warning that failure to reach agreement with Brussels would hit the economy hard.A disorderly Brexit \"could have severe short-term implications for the economy, the exchange rate, asset prices and the public finances\", warned the Governments independent forecaster. The scale would be very hard to predict, it noted, given the lack of precedent.\"Setting out his income tax cuts, the Chancellor not only mentioned the threshold rise for the higher rate of income tax but also said the personal allowance would rise to pound, from April . The changes had been due to come into force in .Mr Hammond said it would put \"pound in the pocket of a typical basic rate taxpayer\". The Treasury calculated the cumulative effect of increases in tax thresholds since  at pound, for basic rate payers and pound, for those paying the higher rate.The Chancellor set out a five-year plan for departmental spending which will see Whitehall budgets rise by an average of . per cent a year.Detailed figures made clear that the lions share of this extra funding will go to the Department of Health to pay for a pound.bn boost to NHS spending in England, while other departments see their budgets rise in line with inflation.Downing Street insisted the spending pledges were fully funded, irrespective of the outcome of Brexit talks.As well as giving, there was some taking.In a move designed to put the UK at the forefront of international action to adapt tax systems to the digital age, the Chancellor announced a poundm levy aimed at internet giants such as Google and Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"poorest-university-students-saddled-with-largest-debts","story":"The Student Awards Agency for Scotland said the most disadvantaged students were taking annual loans of pound, compared to pound, for the most affluent.For a student on a four-year degree course this would amount to more than pound, of debt.The figures also show the number of students receiving grants and bursaries rose by .% -

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector. They say the closure of the toilets would have an environmental and economic impact. A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118016.jpg","title":"Marathon trek pays off for charity","story":"A THURSO man has raised more than pound for charity by walking coast-to-coast across Scotland.Douglas Fraser decided to raise awareness of prostate cancer and raise money at the same time.\"As I enjoy walking I decided to do a coast-to-coast walk across Scotland and ask the public to donate money.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amHannah Beaven — Scotland#s number one female powerlter — will represent her country once more.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In order to try and open the to satisfy the Highland Councilrsquos many conditions for safe access.\"These are both long-running issues, whichthey came to fruition, would be assets to the town.\"The community council remains committed to seeing both of these projects through to completion and with the help of Highland Council and the local population we see no reason why this cannot be achieved.\"According to Mr Shepherd the plans are to replace a large part of the bridge with \"old recycled crane boom sections and hopefully, my contact can find some more to help out with the project to replace the old bridge over the canal.\"Fellow member of Dingwall Community Council, George Murray, said: \"There have been so many complaints regarding the bridge being closed that the issue has been constantly on the community council agenda.\"Itrsquos an important feature of the lsquoRound Dingwall walkrsquo and needs to be repaired and reopened.\"We have an area of scenic beauty that the public cannot access without walking along and crossing over the railway tracks.He added: \"Whilst I appreciate that the Highland Council seem to be having trouble funding anything outside of Inverness, this should not be a lsquobridge too farrsquo and we will be looking at all ways to fund the repair which could be helped by the Dingwall Common Good Fundpossible.\"Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am. Work is expected to be complete by late next month.Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The move is believed to be a first in Scotland.“They refused to teach them because they’d been assaulted so many times”, said a school source. “There’s just no control.”The eight students are understood to have spent last week in a class together with seven pupil support assistants.“The headteacher told the teachers on Monday morning they weren’t allowed in the school. This is the first time this has ever happened in Scotland. A teacher has refused to teach one kid before but never eight,” added the school source.But an Edinburgh City Council source said the issue was a red line that was “discriminating against disabled children”. They added: “You cannot pick and choose which disabled children you provide a service for”.Union bosses are set to meet with education secretary John Swinney tomorrow about the situation, after negotiations with the council broke down.Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, labelled the council’s action as “one of the most disturbing cases I have ever experienced of an employer failing in its duty of care”.She said: “The teachers, and indeed other pupils at the school have, month after month, faced violent physical assaults, a constant stream of verbal abuse and threats and malicious allegations. Equipment has been smashed and classrooms trashed.“Rather than supporting the teachers to deal with these pupils, Edinburgh City Council instead has embarked on a campaign of aggressive and punitive actions towards the teachers, simply because they have dared to stand up for what is right.”Staff experienced with working with children with special needs have been brought in to cover the absentees. The council is appealing for the union to come back to the negotiation table and has written to parents to update them on the situation.A council spokesman said: “As a local authority, we have a duty to provide education to all children in Edinburgh. We are also committed to ensuring our teachers and other staff are fully supported to deliver the excellent level of education children and young people have a right to expect.“We continually review how we can support our teachers in what at times can be challenging places to work. An improvement action plan for Kaimes School has been developed in consultation with staff and subject to external expert scrutiny. This is in the very early stages of being implemented and would urge everyone to work with us as we take this plan forward. “The council has been trying to engage with NASUWT at all levels to discuss any concerns they have and we are disappointed that they have failed to respond positively to date and decided on this course of action. We cannot have a situation where staff decide who they are and who they are not willing to teach as this would be contrary to their terms of employment.“We remain committed to working with staff to ensure we improve attainment and wellbeing while also delivering a positive working environment for both teachers and pupils. This is part of the council’s commitment to put inclusion at the heart of everything we do and we want the staff involved and the NASUWT to sit down with us as soon as possible to resolve this situation.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4822413.1540994935!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon announced 700k investment for circular economy","story":"More than #, will be invested by the Scottish Government to help boost the country#s circular economy.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement in an address to the Circular Economy Hotspot event in Glasgow on Wednesday.Businesses in the circular economy aim to reduce waste and invest in keeping materials in circulation for as long as possible.Three businesses - Total Homes and Revive Eco, located in Glasgow, and Angus D, based in Tayside - will receive funding.Total Homes deliver house clearances for Housing Associations in Glasgow and ensure household appliances, furniture and other goods are re-used.They will be given £, worth of funding.Revive Eco, which collects used coffee grounds and recycles them to create high value bio-oils, will receive £,.Angus D, which aims to bring the latest metal D printing technology to Scotland, will be given a total of £,.Scotland has four circular economy regions: Circular Glasgow, Circular Edinburgh, Circular Tayside and Circular North East - with each working on projects tailored to local opportunities. - Tests carried out on four cows culled at farm with BSE caseAnalysis suggests that a circular approach by businesses could be worth a potential £ billion to the north-east and Tayside economies.Reports were produced with the assistance of the local chambers of commerce to evaluate the impact it could have in each area of Scotland.The First Minister said: “Moving to a circular economy -and this I think is true of many issues relating to the environment and climate change - is, first and foremost, an overwhelming moral imperative.

In particular, we memorialise our teachers, and we can end up eulogising people who we didn’t actually like very much at the time. Or, indeed, learn much from – the eccentric the easily erted the overly strict the ‘real character’. Time and time again, we hear people in middle age talking about how great their teachers were. I do it too – I became an English teacher because I was taught by a great English teacher, James Caw, now sadly gone – a clever, humane andwitty man, who indisputably changed the whole direction of my le and led me to a career that I loved .The truth of the matter, though, is that for all this sentiment, those of us who haven’t been schoolchildren for a while have to face the fact – teachers are a great deal better today than they were , ,  years ago. There are exceptions on both sides, but today’s teaching profession is just that – professional: better trained, better scrutinised and better organised. It’s much more dficult to get into teaching these days. In  when I graduated, I just walked into Moray House College to train – one application form did the trick. These days it’s a tough day’s interviewing, group work, assessments and you have to be better qualied to start with. In the later stages of my career, I watched lots of young teachers teach, just turning up in their classrooms unannounced to save them from buying fireworks. Almost without exception their lessons were painstakingly prepared, ied and thought through, and entirely relevant. : Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersI remember telling one young maths teacher thatshe had taught me, I would have been a maths teacher . Someone like me – dependent on telling lots of jokes, slapdash with my diary and not exactly up to speed with IT – wouldn’t cut the mustard these days, for all my passion and confidence. Nowhere is this truer than in the area now called the ‘expressive arts’. When, years ago, the powers that be decided that there were too many heads of department in schools, they invented a faculty system to save money which absolutely nobody liked. So the scientists, for example, were all lumped together, which to the layman might seem fine, but try telling a physicist that a biologist is now in charge! So art, music and drama were pushed into a boat and again that might seem sensible enough, but they had to put PE somewhere and so the PE teachers all climbed aboard So please think about the people who taught you these subjects years back. In my case, I was in a boys’ school, so while we got to do plays, there was no professional drama teaching, presumably on the grounds that drama was considered, in essence, an effeminate pursuit . However, in art, in music and in PE, there was, at least as I understand the word, not really any ‘teaching’ at all. In the art class of my youth we tried to draw things, and, to misquote Macbeth, “ we failed, we failed’. My art teacher in S was a young guy and he, sensing my hopelessness, used to sit and talk to me about pop music indeed he sold me some albums cheap. It might have been better, all things considered,he had explained why the people in my pictures all looked like balloons. : Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertI could sing, so music was better, where the kindly but ancient teacher went round the class of -year-olds saying “you can sing”, and “please stop singing” until he had the choir picked – those who couldn’t sing just sat and read. And, most parlous of all was PEwhere great kindness was shown towards me in my capacity as a skinny wee uncoordinated ... oh I don’t know what the word is. I remember once Mr Hastie, a very fine man, becoming exasperated during a game of rounders and shouting, “Wyllie, you don’t throw a ball like that!”, marching over and showing me how to hold the bloody thing which I then, of course, could throw from that point on. It was a rare momentof ... teaching.How times have changed. A few years ago in my capacity as a senior manager I was selected to “quality assure” the work of the PE department. I have no idea why. Anyway I found myself one brisk November day watching a group ofgirls being taught in the school playground. I was, I’m sure, unobserved in my observation, while they started off on a run, and then watched while the teacher, rather than standing smoking a fag like the teachers of my youth, ran beside the slowest girl, and encouraged her along, stopping with her to take a break, then took them inside and started coaching them in volleyball skills. What dferent days it could have been for those of us, as Janis Ian puts it, “whose names were never called, when choosing sides for basketball”. The same is true in art and in music, where the warm kindness of the teachers flows through the room while they teach the necessary skills to write a mazurka, or make a pot or design a dress or play a xylophone where talent is recognised and appreciated, but where the talentless at least learn something. And everyone does drama too! So today I take my hat offto teachers of the “expressive arts” – thank you for letting the children of Scotland express themselves.

Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8685096.1540801538!/image/image.jpg","title":"super savings on discount day","story":"Forget Halloween and Christmas, there#s only date that needs to be in your diary this year and it#s the biggest and best shopping day in Ballymena.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War.

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tiocfaidh a la carte","story":"LONG Quiche, Come Out You Rack Of Lambs, The Frying Column and Turkey Ár Lá – these were just some of the frontrunners for the name of the new cookbook by former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, who finally settled on The Negotiators Cookbook – Best Kept Secret of the Peace Process.The Negotiators Cookbook is the latest offering from Adams and it gives an insight into a part of the peace process that up until now has had little light shone upon it.The book details the efforts of two of the insiders, Ted Howell and Pádraic Wilson, to sustain the stamina and energy of the Sinn Féin negotiating team during years of high level negotiations with the British government and includes many of their recipes.Speaking at the launch in An Chultúrlann on Monday, Mr Adams said: “I’m here to tell you about one of the best kept secrets of the Irish peace process.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

Delamont already has stunning picturesque walks, a childrenrsquos adventure playground, miniature railway and cafe, but more investment is needed to enhance what it has to offer.Cllr Walker said creating new attractions will increase the parkrsquos profile and attract even more visitors.He added: ldquoI have always argued Delamont offers massive tourist potential and that with some imaginative thinking and new investment, it can rival any country park in Ireland.

As I was always in the public eye, it was dreadful, said Naomi.ldquoIrsquove lost about half of the weight that I put on and have still about two and a half stone to lose yet.ldquoBecause of the stroke, I also wasnrsquot able to walk when I got home and I wasnrsquot talking right.

She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
