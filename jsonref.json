Pictured: Gold Inlaid Canopic Coffinette of Tutankhamun Dedicated to Imseti and IsisThe show is ided into four sections. Three focus on the complicated funerary process King Tut underwent, from his mummification and preparation for burial, to his journey through the underworld and then his eternal rebirth.The fourth concerns the tomb\u0027s 1922 discovery by Carter, who had spent 16 years on the task, funded by the 5th Earl of Carnarvon.Amid the ancient splendours, the giant statuary and the solid yards of beaten gold, it is the tiny details that compel.Like the shabti dolls, standing silently to attention behind their glass cases, 3,000 years after unknown hands carved them from wood and stone, or created them from Egyptian faience, the oldest known glazed ceramic on the planet. Shabti are small mummy-shaped figurines, slightly bigger than Oscar statuettes, with sweet little bottoms. In ancient Egypt, these funerary figures accompanied the dead to the underworld, but they were not mere toys or comforters. They were placed in tombs to do any work the deceased might request of them in the afterlife.Naturally, the boy king Tutankhamen had hundreds of shabti, many made in his likeness. The one I really love is carved from wood with a head the size of an apple and a little of the dreamy, Thriller-era Michael Jackson about him. Next to him is his Beyoncé-alike wife, in a complicated wig and elaborate eyeliner.I marvel at the delicacy of the carving the ancient chisel marks sculpting a cheekbone or paring the perfect chin and also at their blank, unwavering stares into eternity, for they have survived the civilisation that created them.There are some stunning statues, including a fabulous life-size sentinel with obsidian eyes striding forth into the underworld like a man on a mission.There is also a badly damaged colossal statue of Tutankhamun, one of a pair that stood at the entrance to his mortuary, still a beauty despite the ravages of time.Some of the funds raised on this tour will go towards completing the long-awaited Grand Egyptian Museum, a huge complex of galleries and laboratories being built near the pyramids at Giza, just outside Cairo.The museum has been two decades in the making, has cost untold millions and is about ten years overdue. The latest opening was supposed to be in May, but that has been delayed for another two years, even though Egypt desperately needs this museum.Cairo\u0027s famous Egyptian Museum was never quite up to the task of displaying these treasures. When I last visited, it was like a giant, dusty junk shop, with a surfeit of mummies stacked in corners.When the galleries are finally finished, all 5,000 of the objects found in Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb will be the main tourist attraction, never to leave Egypt again.The opening of Tut\u0027s tomb has never stopped fascinating the world. Yet the expectations around the 1972 exhibition and those of today are entirely different.         At least 60 of them, including two silver trumpets, believed to be the oldest functioning musical instruments in the world, have never left Egypt beforeBack then there was no internet, while TV and newspapers were in black and white and access to information and images was limited. People queued all night to see the solid gold death mask, which is now deemed too fragile to travel and remains in Egypt.It was the very first of the museum blockbuster exhibitions, greeted with a fervour that became known as Tutankhamunophilia. Even the V\u0026ampA\u0027s recent Christian Dior exhibition, the most visited in its history, could boast crowds of only 590,000 — about a third of Tut\u0027s numbers 47 years ago.Back then, Tut\u0027s face duly appeared on posters, postcards, carrier bags and 56 million commemorative stamps.The British Museum sold out of replica jewellery on the first day, and it set a future merchandising precedent for the mugs, keyrings and tea-towels that remain popular to this day.In a lavish gift shop, today\u0027s Treasures Of The Golden Pharaoh sells eye-popping Tut tat, including a giant replica death mask made from gold, brass and copper for — wait for it — 26,000 euros.Will the crowds still be enthralled? It is hard not to be. Here, behind the glass cases beats the will of a civilisation that thrived more than 3,000 years ago. A people who believed that life carried on after death. To facilitate this, in workshops and factories along the Nile, unknown hands smelted bronze, beat copper, carved wood and painted, painted, painted.When his mourners sealed Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb in the Valley of Kings at Luxor, they intended that no living being would ever again gaze on the gold, gems and craftsmanship of a lost civilisation.Yet here they are again.Tutankhamun: Treasures Of The Golden Pharaoh, presented by Viking Cruises, opens at the Saatchi Gallery on November 2.

It is included in Streetwise, a new collection of pictures from the archives of the Magnum agency. The Magnum name became synonymous with street photography in the 1950s and 1960s under the guiding influence of co-founder Henri Cartier-Bresson. The current volume pays homage to Cartier-Bresson’s black-and-white “decisive moments” and examines the way that that spirit has been taken forward, particularly after advances in digital photography and printing enabled a revolution in colour in the 1980s.Harvey was elected into the agency – there is a voting process among the membership – in the year that this picture was taken. By then, as a staff photographer for National Geographic, he had been taking pictures for more than three decades. A principle subject was the Hiic diaspora on both sides of the Atlantic – the “ided soul”, as he terms it, of Latin culture.Harvey traces his vocation back to a long period of isolated convalescence he endured as a child after contracting polio. His ward had a single window, which he stared out of for several months he came to understand it as his viewfinder. Taking that small square out with him into the world, his pictures, as here, are often concerned with little poetic moments of contradiction and the subtleties of framing. The horizontal planes of the parked cars on the tarmac are counterpointed with the airiness and rainbow colours of the balloons rising beyond the frame.

She has the bearing of a schoolteacher, but the suggestion of fastidiousness draws attention to the one real oddity: her overcoat is two or three sizes too big. She is emblematic of the times and of the women I interviewed for Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation. The book will be published into an environment that is still full of toxic narratives around immigration, and at a time when the Home Office has failed to learn lessons from what has become known as the -Windrush scandal. Setting out from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s, many could not conceive of snow, and winter coats were almost impossible to acquire. Such women remind me of my mother, Ethlyn, and all of her Caribbean peers memorialised in the book. These giants of my childhood were extraordinary dreamers and romancers who had dared to travel 4,000 miles to a place they had only imagined from arcane ceremonies carried out by governors and other colonial officials, from Pathé newsreels and from the West Indian Reader textbooks sent from England. Some, such as George Mangar, were better prepared. Mangar’s mother packed 100 shirts into a travelling trunk when he left British Guiana (now Guyana). In his first winter in frosty Britain, he wore three at a time. Others were more cavalier. “Summerwear” got his nickname following his determination on leaving Jamaica to wear light summer suits in England no matter the weather, come hail or storm. “Whatever became of Summerwear?” I asked Ethlyn when researching the book. “Well,” she said, “within a few months he caught a chill and died.”Growing up in 1970s Luton, I was always impressed by what I considered a West Indian code – the phlegmatic shrug and the great store of humour that eased their passage through life. Struggling to find work in a prejudicial environment, one man was often informed that it was “a terrible shame but you’ve just turned up a little too late”. His wry assessment of the news was typically West Indian: “Boy, the Englishman is the nicest man out when he’s telling you ‘no’.”Faced with rejection, West Indians mostly pulled up the collar of their coats and walked on – at least that was their initial remembrance as I sat down with them. The palpable veil of respectability, which descended almost as soon as I began to record them, was testament to the peculiar reserve and reticence among West Indians of my parents’ generation to share information. “Me don’t like chat people’s business” is a phrase you’ll often hear in West Indian households. But perhaps because of my Jamaican background, when interviewing these octogenarians that guardedness dissolved as they immersed themselves in reminiscences. They soon reverted to the kind of salty, mischievous and thrilling behaviour that took me back to the 60s and 70s.The poet Derek Walcott once asserted: “All Port of Spain is a noon-day show.” As a child that same vibrancy was evident at almost any gathering I attended of Caribbean people. They were a contrast to the British, who seemed to have worked out that the whole point to life was to proceed, with as little fuss as possible, towards death. Yet in the 70s, our Caribbeanness rarely found expression outside of the four walls that bound us. Even so, I’ve long felt the Caribbean influence in Britain. Recently my ears pricked up when listening to PJ Harvey’s Let England Shake. One of that album’s most stunning tracks derives its power from the reggae chorus of Niney the Observer’s Blood and Fire: “there is no more water to put out the fire, let it burn, let it burn”. It might very well be an anthem for our times, heralding the embrace of chaos which borders on nihilism.Going to Britain? could not have prepared the West Indian pioneers for this moment, nor for the fact that, 60 years after their arrival, some of them would be scandalously deported. Joyce Trotman, now aged 91, gives an overview of how British West Indians have been cast since her arrival in 1954. “First we were children of empire, then citizens of the Commonwealth, and now foreigners and immigrants.” Those who found themselves ejected from the bosom of the motherland were further insulted by the cultural advice offered by British officials about what to expect on arrival back in Jamaica. Lesson one was how to “sound Jamaican” and not to attract attention to their Britishness. The sense of shame of these insulted black Britons is compounded by the notion that you left the Caribbean poor, with a desire to travel to Britain to better yourself you were not expected to return empty and broken.“Respect” is the most important word in the Jamaican lexicon. To ensure that a mess like the Windrush scandal never happens again, the government should empty the coffers of the Treasury and give the forced returnees whatever sum might assuage their pain. The financial consequences must be such that officials would think twice in the future. And while we’re at it, let’s strip those enforcers of the hostile environment policy of any honours they may subsequently have received.Perhaps no level of apology can compensate for the humiliation inflicted. But 60 years on from Going to Britain? we will have reached a dangerous point if there’s an absence of water to put out the fire of resentment that burns in the bosom of all of us, ashamed at the reckless and callous treatment of the most vulnerable members of the Windrush generation.• Colin Grant is the author of Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e0603e19d9dd33a89cb026a842bf558188d27c/0_265_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2df18a46e1cb3f2a0b8e7e773e7581ef","title":"matthew rhys welsh bafta cardiff born and bred","story":"An American viewer who comes across the line-up of leading men nominated for the Welsh Baftas this month might be brought up short by one of the four names. Michael Sheen? Tick. Celyn Jones? Yes, certainly sounds Welsh. Sir Anthony Hopkins? No questions asked. But what about Matthew Rhys? He’s an A-lister in the US, where he won an Emmy last year, and many fans have no idea he was not raised on their side of the Atlantic.But Rhys, 44, who co-stars with Tom Hanks in the very American film A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, is in fact Cardiff born and bred. His surname is a clue, yet the actor’s mastery of accents, particularly in the award-winning spy television series The Americans, has shaped his career, keeping him working largely in the US, where he first appeared in the popular series Brothers and Sisters with Sally Field and Calista Flockhart.Fellow American cast members are not always happy, he told the Observer this weekend, when they discover he is Welsh. “I do get comments like, ‘When are you going back?’ and ‘Have you got leave to stay?’ It is all done under the guise of joking about it, but they are annoyed by it.”Despite his proud Welsh identity, Rhys is now to play a major American fictional hero: Perry Mason. The actor has been cast as the crime-busting California lawyer in a major television reboot set and filmed in Los Angeles. The HBO show will go back to the 1932 setting of the original books by Erle Stanley Gardner, rather than pick up on the 1960s setting of the vintage black and white television series, starring Raymond Burr.Before Mason becomes a defence lawyer, Rhys’s version will show him working as a low-rent private investigator, haunted by his wartime experiences and mourning a broken marriage.The actor’s high profile in America now suits him domestically since he lives in New York with Keri Russell, his co-star in The Americans, and their young son. His Welsh Bafta nomination comes, however, for his recent British television appearance with Jamie Dornan in BBC2’s drama series Death and Nightingales. And he says that being professionally recognised for this in his native land means a lot to him: “You want the plaudits most from your hometown somehow. It’s there you want to prove yourself, so being nominated there is the greatest accolade, especially to be alongside Sir Tony, Celyn and Sheeny. That is a really rounded category.”The wealth of Welsh acting talent on the market at the moment suggests a ratio per head that is now beaten only by the output of Eton College. How does Rhys explain the success of such a small country?“There are a lot of us,” he agreed. “I think it is a perfect storm. For me, the inspiration was Richard Burton. I grew up watching his films and thinking, hey, there is this world-famous actor and he comes from Port Talbot! And Anthony Hopkins came next as the giant A-lister.”Hopkins is also from the Port Talbot area, as is Sheen, but Rhys thinks the explanation lies in the culture, not the geography. “I’m sure I will get a rise taken out of me for this, but I think it is because of the bardic tradition and the Welsh storytelling tradition. Regardless of your schooling in Wales, you are all expected to take part in a festival, the Eisteddfod, that has poetry recital and music, as well as performance. It is not just encouraged, it is commonplace. And I love that fact. I know people who have gone on to work in business but say it really helped them with public speaking.”Last November his friend Rhys Ifans, another Welsh star, was a leading signatory to a letter complaining when the National Theatre of Wales failed to cast Welsh actors. Although Rhys himself is guilty of often playing Americans, he feels the arguments for him are different.“In America, I don’t feel I am robbing jobs from anyone, because of the vastness of the country. There is plenty to go round. But in Wales, and in a national company, I agree that they really should be looking to Welsh actors first,” he said.Rhys also campaigned with Ifans last month to get more Welsh children inside cinemas. They both believe it is a good habit to form. “We have so many platforms now, but it still matters to have that different experience of watching a film with 100 other people at an early age, all gasping, or laughing or crying. Tarantino has been banging the drum about this recently, and we advocate it as well.”Rhys’s new film with Hanks is his second, following his role in The Post as the whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. This time, in another story based on real life, Hanks portrays Fred Rogers, a well-known children’s television presenter in America. Rhys plays jaded Lloyd Vogel, a character based on Tom Junod, who wrote an acclaimed piece for Esquire magazine which inspired the film. It tells of five days he spent with Rogers and the profound effect it had on him.“It was a time when journalists could still embed themselves with a subject for a while,” said Rhys. “Junod always felt you should be silent as an interviewer and let a personality reveal themselves, but he said he met his match in Rogers and found that he was the one opening up.”Despite his busy Hollywood work schedule, Rhys said that he hopes to be offered a leading part in a West End play. “That would be the dream,” he said. And he could play American or Welsh.The British Academy Cymru Awards will be held in Cardiff on 13 OctoberBorn in Flintshire, the star of Brazil will soon be seen with Anthony Hopkins in The Two Popes.Born in Haverfordwest, he has played both Batman and Dick Cheney.

We ask MPs and business leaders including Frank Field and Anna Soubry what they make of its uncompromising vision• Q\u0026ampA with Sorry We Missed You actor Debbie HoneywoodIt’s three years since Ken Loach released I, Daniel Blake, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for its searing depiction of austerity-era Britain, with food banks a dismal fact of life and a benefits system that crushes rather than supports its supposed beneficiaries.Now Loach has turned his attention to another dehumanising trap of our neoliberal age: the world of zero-hours contracts. Sorry We Missed You, again set in Newcastle, tells the story of Ricky and Abbie, a fortysomething couple with two kids whose problems are less to do with finding work than stopping it from eating up their lives. Abbie, played by first-time actor Debbie Honeywood, is a home carer who covers the cost of her own travel between appointments and whose crammed schedule makes it impossible for her to bestow proper care on her vulnerable “clients”.Her husband, Ricky (Kris Hitchen), is a jobbing builder who has had enough of working for other people. Eager to earn extra money to get his family out of debt and into a house of their own, he applies for a driving job at a parcel-delivery company where he is told that “you don’t work for us, you work with us…”What this means in practice is that Ricky has to provide his own vehicle, take responsibility for an expensive scanner that tracks and dictates his every move and face steep penalties if he takes time off work without arranging a replacement driver. Employment benefits such as sick and holiday pay don’t factor here. “You’re a master of your own destiny,” is how the hard-faced branch manager puts it.With this film, which also premiered to great acclaim at Cannes, the 83-year-old Loach and his regular screenwriter Paul Laverty are nothing if not timely. “An expertly judged and profoundly humane movie,” noted the Hollywood Reporter. “You’d have to be made of stone not to be moved to your core by it.”In recent years, stories from the sharp edge of the gig economy have been filtering into the news with increasing regularity. In January 2018, Don Lane, a diabetic DPD courier from Dorset, died of the condition after missing medical appointments because he felt under pressure to keep working, facing £150 daily penalties if he failed to find cover for his shifts. (Lane had previously collapsed twice during his rounds, once while he was actually driving.)Drawing upon such stories, Loach and Laverty drill to the very heart of our contemporary work culture and ask piercing questions of the economic and political systems that support it. But what do the people working at the top of these systems make of the film? We asked politicians and thinktank heads from across the political spectrum to watch Sorry We Missed You, before its release next month, and share their responses.Sorry We Missed You opens on 1 NovemberFrank Field has been the MP for Birkenhead since 1979 and is a specialist on poverty and welfare issues. Last year, he resigned from the Labour party, saying it had become “a force for antisemitism” he now sits as an independentSorry We Missed You is so remarkable. Even though I’ve been exposed to the horrors it depicts, most recently through a series of reports I co-wrote with Andrew Forsey on the gig economy, I found the film deeply shocking and moving. For the many people who’ve never come across these abuses – who don’t realise what is going on in this cruel, exposed underbelly of the labour market – I can’t imagine how they’re going to react. Ken Loach is the great champion of taking us out of our shells and forcing us to ask, of the conveniences we enjoy: “Who is actually paying for this?”Andrew and I have written five reports over the past three years – on Hermes, Uber, DPD, Deliveroo and home care – which back up what is portrayed in the film, so no one can say: “Well, he’s just made this up.” We’ve heard stories of drivers who carry urine bottles and sick buckets because they dare not take time off. Two parents were threatened with loss of work while sitting at their dying little boy’s bedside. One woman was on the operating table while her husband stood outside with Hermes on the phone, telling him he’d “better find cover” for her.These sort of examples I think Dickens would have found hard to believe. But this is what is happening at the bottom end of the labour market.This life of flexibility is fine, if that’s what you actually want, but for millions of people, there is no other choice. They are being forced into self-employment as there is no other option. And then, as our reports and the film show, that regime gets you by the throat. It is a form of such exploitation that it would be very difficult for the supreme court to differentiate between this and other forms of modern slavery.The mother in the film works as a home carer. When I broke my arm and couldn’t fully dress myself, I had a care worker and I talked to her about her job. As in the film, she would have appointments cancelled when she was nowhere near home and she’d end up sitting around on park benches waiting for the next appointment then she had to cover all the costs of travelling between appointments.The parents in the film are like ships in the night. They feed their children via the microwave and struggle to find time to go to the school when something goes wrong. If you want to devise the worst possible way of nurturing children, the gig economy has come up with a model. And if we don’t have happy families in this country, where parents can love their children and nurture them, then we’ll have real problems.What I’m anxious to get across is that the situations in the film aren’t just made up by Ken Loach’s imagination. Behind this family slowly being destroyed by a wicked system, there are hundreds of examples of people who are similarly treated. This film is a very powerful shout for them.Anna Soubry was elected Conservative MP for Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire in 2010. Strongly anti-Brexit, she resigned from the Tories in February to join the newly formed pro-EU party Change UKI have enjoyed Ken Loach films in the past – Kes I thought was stunning – but this film was far from his best. It didn’t have the bite and passion that I expected and I thought it would have worked better as a documentary. With serious topics like this, either you cover it extremely well through drama, with a strong, balanced narrative, or you do it on a factual basis.I went to a tough comprehensive in Worksop, a Nottinghamshire mining town, so from an early age I have been aware that people with few or even low skills will struggle to get well-paid work. I also strongly believe every employer has a duty to treat anyone directly or indirectly in their employ with fairness, decency and respect, including paying them a fair living wage.I know there are problems with the gig economy. We’re in an age where people are buying more online than in shops and that’s fine – people have the right to buy online, and it suits a lot of us, but it means the things we buy have to be delivered. In my opinion, the prices people are paying for delivery are too low. So if we are to do the right thing by delivery drivers, then frankly we will all have to pay more for that service. That’s why I don’t use Uber – I take black cabs and minicabs, because I know that black-cab drivers have to pay all the associated taxes and insurance, and so it’s worth paying extra.The same goes for care workers, like Abbie in the film. I have no doubt they’re being underpaid. To pay them more, national government needs to give our councils more money, which is why you need a strong economy – and you don’t get a strong economy by crashing out of the European Union without a deal or, indeed, leaving the EU in the first place.There are definitely some people – and I found this when I took evidence as a member of a select committee – who, due to their lifestyle and circumstances, choose to work in the gig economy because it suits them. In the film, the dad leaves his job in the construction industry to go down the self-employed route, but I didn’t think it was really clear why he chose that. If he had lost his job at a time of high unemployment, he may well have had little choice and would have been more vulnerable to being exploited. Of course it can be physically challenging, but if you work in the construction industry, you tend to have a skill and you tend to be well paid. That’s one area where I felt the credibility of the film was undermined.I’ve had an example in my own constituency of migrant workers being extremely badly treated by a national employer. Based on the evidence I received from constituents, I went straight to the police and reported it and they raided the employer within two weeks. So I do have huge concerns about people being exploited at work, but the laws exist to protect them. You pick up the phone and you make a proper complaint.David Lammy grew up in Tottenham, north London, and has been Labour MP for the constituency since 2000The term gig economy conveys Shoreditch-based twentysomething hipsters combining life as a playwright with working for Deliveroo. Ken Loach’s polemic exposes that term as a euphemism for a much less glamorous reality. This gig economy is in fact based on zero-hours contracts and the callousness of a modern society that reduces everything to consumer choice. The opening scenes of the film show Ricky having a conversation with the delivery company manager as if he has agency over his decision to enter into this contract. In fact, his path is determined by the absence of a welfare state and a rolling back of hard-won labour rights. Instead of freedom, in this inidualised culture, the poorest are sold a lie that they somehow have choice.Sorry We Missed You is also about the decimation of family life. Both parents are living a zero-hours existence. Abbie works in social care, which is fundamental to an ageing population, helping and supporting vulnerable, disabled, elderly people, but is very poorly paid. Abbie is one of the most lovable characters, and you see her totally stripped of all her dignity in attempting to care for these iniduals, because she’s running from one place to the next with only a short amount of time for each person and no thanks or reward for her work.The film chimed with stories I’ve heard from my own constituents. I will never forget the woman who came to my surgery having developed a very serious kidney infection and renal failure as a result of doing a job for a well-known supermarket where she was not allowed to go to the toilet while standing at her till. Similarly, Ricky has to pee into a bottle while he’s driving because he doesn’t have time for a toilet stop. I have met countless constituents in my surgery who are close to falling asleep because they have come from a relentless shift in which they have not slept for days– so Ricky almost veering off the road due to lack of sleep felt very real.And I’ve been into homes where there’s a cloud of depression hanging over the parents there’s very little food in the fridge, they’re in heavy debt and the children are trying to keep their parents’ spirits up. In this film, too, you could feel the stress levels rising. It was palpable.I also thought of my childhood, when my mother was doing two or three jobs to support us. The idea goes back to Cathy Come Home and latchkey kids having to bring themselves up because their parents are working when they come home from school, and when the parents come home they’re knackered, and I remember that in my own family life. Sorry We Missed You brings across how the right to a family life has been eroded in modern Britain.Claire Fox is founder and director of the Institute of Ideas thinktank and a regular panellist on the BBC Radio 4’s Moral Maze. She is also a Brexit party MEP for North West EnglandThe film shows the flipside to the notion that the gig economy offers flexibility. You think you have control, and then you realise you really are working for someone, but without them having any responsibility for you.But I think it also shows why the gig economy is attractive for so many people. It would be wrong to romanticise the 40-hour week working for an employer, in contrast to the terrible gig economy, where everyone’s exploited, because the reality is that people have the aspiration to control their own destinies. I appreciate that the film is all about showing you that you don’t really, but I think that it’s important to note the aspiration.I thought the care worker’s story was brilliant and spot-on accurate. I’ve got a mother in a care home, and friends who are care workers, so I know what it’s like. The film exemplified the brutality of a wonderful, empathetic carer being denied the right to do her job properly because her schedule prohibits it. I also thought that the characters that she cared for were very well drawn in terms of the challenges and the humiliation of getting old and being dependent. This is a film that should be watched by anyone who’s thinking seriously about social and elderly care.But I also know people who drive and deliver packages who don’t have such a bleak experience as Ricky does. I’m not trying to suggest that the difficulties he encounters aren’t real, but I don’t want to completely denounce all aspects of the gig economy, because it does suit certain people to work in this way.The family’s story is brilliant, with the bright kids trying to negotiate their way around their parents. This film was very good at presenting an average family. The dad says he’d never go on the dole, he’s too proud for that, and he’ll work his guts out for his family – and I know many people who are exactly the same. In that sense, it was insightful, because it shows that even in a family where both parents are working, life can be very tough.Where I think you need to be careful is not to end up having an overly rosy picture about the nine to five. We can and should have a gig economy where workers have rights. So rather than dialling it back to the past, we should try to improve the current situation. Because things change. There’s nothing wrong with delivering parcels and in some ways the technology is amazing. You can be cynical about tracking and big data, but what an amazing achievement that you can have a parcel delivered from anywhere around the world very quickly. Of course there is a human cost of that, but there must be ways of organising it that would be less brutal and more humane, where workers’ rights are recognised. Let’s look at improving the working conditions of the people who are doing the delivering, rather than just saying the whole thing is wrong.Mark Littlewood is the director general of thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs. He was head of media for the Liberal Democrats from 2004 to 2007 and later an adviser to David CameronI found this film less true to life than some of Ken Loach’s work. It’s not inconceivable that a family in Newcastle would find themselves in such a terrible position, but it did seem to me that the film was too down on the gig economy to be wholly plausible.It was therefore difficult to grasp what sort of alternative would have been preferable for the family. Had social care been fully nationalised, and all delivery firms been offering permanent contract work, would they have been better off? All of the insurance risk, and the responsibility for replacing staff who are sick, would now be borne by the company, presumably having a downward pressure on wages.The film was clever at showing the precariousness potentially associated with the dramatic changes that are happening in the labour market. But a relatively high proportion of workers in the gig economy would say that a great advantage of it is that, if your son gets in trouble at school or you fall ill, the flexibility you have is in fact considerably greater than if you are a nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday, working-for-the-same-company-for-40-years sort of employee.The parcel-delivery firm in the film seems, to my understanding of it, pretty close to being on the wrong side of the law and if so, there should be legal sanction against it. I’m not saying it’s fantastical, but I think Loach highlighted the precariousness of the gig economy without actually highlighting the flexibility of it. Of course drama is used to highlight the extremes, but he sure as hell highlighted the extremes here.So if you want to see the gloomiest, bleakest, worst possible run of luck that a family in Newcastle could have, working in flexible gig jobs, this film shows it. And I think it provides a legitimate point of concern about how normal families adapt to a much less certain, less secure working environment.But I was scratching my head thinking about the counterfactual: would these people have been better off in the pre-gig economy world? I don’t really think they would have been, but for their horrific run of bad luck. I wonder whether Loach’s film might have been a little stronger if the characters involved hadn’t had all of the very worst things imaginable thrown at them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733aa5c47f26d597f81b26b87c8bb614bd2eb41c/0_90_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7959821c8bd7b39ee672ff04797f8016","title":"tyler perry atlanta film studio star packed party","story":"Oprah Winfrey and Halle Berry help launch writer-director’s facility, one of largest in USThe writer and director Tyler Perry has officially opened his massive new film studio in Atlanta, with a party that drew celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Samuel L Jackson and Halle Berry.Spike Lee, Cicely Tyson and others also helped Perry launch his new facility, a 134-hectare (330-acre) studio, one of the largest in the US, that once served as a Confederate army base.“I think it’s pivotal in everything that we’ve done, everything that we’re doing still, that we continue to try to motivate and inspire people,” said Perry, who was once homeless.Winfrey praised Perry and said the new studio head was a force to be reckoned with.“He didn’t wait for other people to validate or to say you should go this way, or that way.

It’s a hard moment for us, a difficult moment, but we are United – we need to keep fighting.“We conceded a goal from a corner for us. That cannot happen. It is not acceptable. Not just this game the whole season is not good.”De Gea’s sentiments were echoed and endorsed by a manager who appears in danger of breaking all sorts of unwanted records at Old Trafford after the most underwhelming of starts to the season. “We didn’t create enough chances to deserve to win,” said Solskjær who expressed sympathy with his centre-half Harry Maguire for missing his side’s best chance, a clear close range first-half header.“It was such a disappointing performance, particularly in the first half,” said the Norwegian. “I’d like to say sorry to the fans that we’re not wining games. The second half was better but the decision-making wasn’t good enough. Confidence is a big thing. At the moment when there’s a decision to be made, the players don’t make it instinctively, that’s affecting everyone.“These boys give everything they’ve got for the shirt but we’ve given ourselves a very tough task to get to the top six, let alone the top four we need to start getting results fast. We need to win almost every game. We need to raise our game, especially away from home, we need to raise our supporters’ mood.”Solskjær conceded that his side had been caught cold by the rapid counterattack which prefaced Longstaff’s winner. “We weren’t set up for the counterattack and that shouldn’t happen,” he said. “At the moment it’s just not going for us but I’ve missed bigger chances than Harry.”After winning his first game as a manager against the club he once played for, Bruce was somewhat happier. “It’s quite ironic Matty Longstaff’s beat Manchester United in his first game, I’ve been trying for 20-odd years,” said Newcastle’s manager, whose side responded superbly following last Sunday’s 5-0 thrashing at Leicester. “It was typical Matty that the first thing he said when he came off was “thank you”. It’s been a difficult week but I’m delighted with the performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2601ff7802c55382654dedd85b8bdbb9ea5829d8/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a1b1b5336277d42d33238e3abf3ec87b 1760w","title":"what are your views on modern masculinity","story":"For our second series about modern masculinity, we’d like to hear men’s views on fatherhood and getting older Earlier in the year we did a call out to  readers asking for your views on the issues affecting men which helped guide a series looking at modern masculinity in 2019.Your responses led us to address questions around role models, intergenerational relationships and even the popularity of Jordan Peterson, and we want to return with a second series, led by you, looking deeper into the areas that you want to see us addressing.We know about some of the issues that men are interested in discussing such as pornography, fatherhood and getting older, so we want to hear your views on those topics but we’d also like you to tell us what we should cover in the next series too.You can share your views in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you prefer.

Regular mealtimes are also an important cue for your circadian rhythm. Avoid exercise too close to bedtime, as it can cause restlessness and an elevated body temperature, says Samantha Briscoe, a senior physiologist at the Sleep Centre at London Bridge hospital.Preserve the bedroom as a place for sleep (and sex): there is evidence that the brain forms a strong association with sleep there. A temperature of 16-18C (60-64F) is thought to be ideal for most, according to the Sleep Council, an awareness and support organisation. Blackout blinds or an eye mask can help block out light, while keeping electronic devices out of the bedroom is highly recommended. If you struggle to fall asleep after more than 25 minutes, Matthew Walker – a sleep expert and a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley –  suggests getting up and going to read under a dim light in another room. Once sleepy, you can return to bed.Your night-time routine is an opportunity to make mornings run a little smoother: choose your clothes for the next day when you reach for your pyjamas or pack your bag while brushing your teeth. Martin Hagger, a professor of health psychology at the University of California, Merced, has stressed how routines are linked to the formation of healthy habits.“If your mind is buzzing from the day, try keeping a journal or worry book,” suggests Hill. The NHS also recommends writing to-do lists for the next day in order to organise thoughts and clear the mind. “If you experience difficulty with sleep over the longer term, consider whether there may be an underlying medical condition,” says Hill. A sleep diary could help you identify any patterns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d1ca9be40ece8ea1b50e1cd99942fdcd7f1e34/0_344_5163_3098/master/5163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=277565626d8430fa5fc2d84e24203651","title":"how often should you wash your gym kit","story":"What’s the worst thing you can catch from sweaty sportswear? Does it make any difference how hard you work out, or where? Here’s some expert adviceAs is the case with many questions, the answer to how often to wash your gym kit is: “It depends.” If you are someone who doesn’t really break into a sweat and stands around gossiping, your kit may last a few visits before washing. But if you work out hard, it will need washing every time. Many modern sportswear fabrics demand a low-temperature wash however, that won’t get rid of the bacteria that can thrive on sweaty clothes. If you wash at lower than 40C, it is worth adding an antibacterial laundry cleanser. You can usually find them with washing liquids and powders in supermarkets. It is either that or crank up the heat.It doesn’t matter whether you exercise indoors or outdoors: the kit will still get dirty. In a gym setting, you can pick up germs and dirt from other people using the machines or mats (think colds, flu, gastrointestinal infections, skin infections). If you exercise outdoors, you will pick up mud, bacteria and stains from the natural environment. Either way, what you wear needs a clean.Rather than leaving stuff in a bag overnight, it is better to wash your gymwear at once, as this reduces the chance of bacterial multiplication. You have to do it at some point anyway, and if you wash it straight away, it is ready for your next outing. Finally, don’t forget to wash your sweaty towels and your water bottle: if this can go in the dishwasher, put it in, otherwise it will get smelly.Lisa Ackerley, aka the Hygiene Doctor, a professorial fellow of the Royal Society for Public Health, was talking to Nell Frizzell"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e45b8319ae12e54ccd163ab2944b49c9f00450/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0ac9eaff0063081ce3d9d268d0602ee","title":"my birth mothers terrible accusations are tearing me apart mariella frostrup","story":"Mariella Frostrup tells a woman to look seriously at what she hopes to achieve by pursuing ‘the truth’ about her conceptionThe dilemma I was given up for adoption as a baby. I’m in my 50s now. I’ve never met my mother but, with the help of the adoption agency that forwarded my letters, she claimed that although they were in a relationship, my father raped her. I’ve been searching for him since my early 20s and had asked my mother for more information to find him. She refused. Last year I found him. We are now in regular contact. I haven’t told him that my mother said he raped her and then became pregnant. He is in his 80s and fragile. I worry what it would do to him. I think it’s a lie. He tells me how much they loved each other and he doesn’t understand why she broke off the relationship. I find it hard to live with her accusation and she refuses to have anything to do with me. She has done so much damage in her dealing with the whole matter, and this huge accusation. Is there anything I can do?Mariella replies Give her the benefit of the doubt? She may not appear to merit sympathy or understanding and she certainly hasn’t shown either in her dealings with you based on your longer description. Nevertheless, I’d caution you not to dismiss her story out of hand. I appreciate the matter has been handled clumsily and you must hurt deeply. It’s worth remembering that putting your baby up for adoption is far from the easy option. There’s every reason to assume it was an agonising time for her and, perhaps, your father, too.It’s natural to want to investigate your story, but as you’ve discovered it doesn’t always produce easy or even comprehensible answers. The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there, as LP Hartley famously wrote in The Go-Between. Having an illegitimate baby in the 1960s was not the acceptable choice it is today and we may never know how much your mother’s narrative was influenced by the society she lived in. Without access to her history you are working in the dark.Today’s prevalent culture when it comes to issues around sex and permission is to assume guilt until proven innocent, which is not the way our justice system is set up to work. There’s every reason to believe your mum’s account and, controversial though it might seem, the same expectation of veracity is due to your dad. Crime or no crime, when it comes to your conception it’s unlikely that it will be atoned for in their lifetimes. If your mother is telling the truth it might explain why she’s so furiously tried to keep you away from the man who violated her. If it’s just a story she’s invented to help assuage her feelings about having had you adopted that’s equally understandable, though not justified. I’m not sure you’ll ever be certain you have “the truth”. Memory is subjective, there are many blanks to be filled and most of us know that history is just a version of what occurred as seen from a particular vantage point. I know digging is an irresistible urge and can sometimes net great rewards, but there are times when you are left with the little you had spoiled or reduced by your discoveries.There’s not enough detail in your letter to know whether your father knew your mother was pregnant, and that’s a further layer to dig through. What is it that you want to know? If your father breaks down and admits your conception wasn’t consensual, will it change the relationship you’ve invested in? It will make him a rapist, but at this distance it may be hard not to keep loving him, so you’ll try to find other ways of excusing him based on your desire to remain close. If your mother’s account is true, will it alter the sense of abandonment you feel and that she’s done nothing to alleviate?You have had a lot of emotional damage to contend with and it’s common to start looking for answers to such conundrums in midlife. There is obviously an awful lot of pain, mistrust and potentially worse embedded in your parents’ liaison. Carrying the burden of that is a choice. The most rewarding thing to investigate here is your own motive in pursuing this story and the hopes you clearly carry for emotional reconciliation with at least one of your birth parents, and whether you can find the wherewithal to step beyond the shadow of the past and use those experiences to give you greater resilience in your own life. Dark corners are sometimes better undisturbed unless the benefit of illuminating them outweighs the destructive force of secrets revealed. I really can’t tell you whether or not you should hold your father to account. Your impulse to find a villain may backfire and your mother emerge as a traumatised survivor of a crime perpetrated by the frail man you now describe. You must choose how far you want to take this investigation and why you want to make that journey to find out why you feel the way you do and whether the answers lie in your parents’ past or in liberating yourself from their tortured story in order to make a happier one for yourself. It’s not an emotional trip suited to the solo traveller. I suggest you find yourself a good psychologist (contact mind.org.uk). If you’re determined to open Pandora’s box, which you have every right to do, you’ll need experts on hand to deal with what flows forth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e594d1beec1c25d04d3e18d52f6a2e4227d0c76e/0_9_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12539aaae8f5022d344cd6903c2a4f15","title":"bbc iplayer revamp life beyond channels","story":"Move is latest attempt to deal with changes in the way people consume televisionThe BBC is preparing a complete revamp of its iPlayer streaming service in the face of competition from Netflix, as it prepares for a life beyond traditional television channels.The move is the latest attempt by the corporation to deal with changes in the way that people consume television and maintain its relevance to younger audiences.The BBC expects iPlayer to become the main way people view its programmes. Shows will be made available by default for up to a year, rather than the previous 30-day limit.Although traditional television channels still account for the vast proportion of British TV viewing, and the broadcaster intends to focus on those channels and on-demand for the foreseeable future, the transition to streaming risks leaving the BBC behind.No date has been set for the relaunch, which will be the service’s fourth major revamp since it launched 12 years ago. It will retain its name but the “look and feel” will be changed, while all BBC channels and live events will be integrated alongside box sets.In a speech on Monday, the BBC director general will describe the changes as “a new front door for British creativity”, as the broadcaster promises talent “unprecedented levels of creative freedom” and a “broader shop window” on BBC platforms. Tony Hall will also publicly accept that the corporation simply cannot compete in financial terms with the resources of its US rivals.Hall previously said that “new entrants” into the streaming market, such as Disney Plus and Apple TV – which are both due to launch before March 2020 – will shake up the existing order. The revamp of the BBC’s streaming service is described as a direct response to the shifting landscape by the broadcaster.Disney Plus will launch in the US in November with Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises on the service, which costs $6.99 (£5.40) a month compared with $13.99 for Netflix. Apple TV will also be available in November for $4.99 per month, as Netflix is put “under siege” by the new ventures.The iPlayer relaunch will be essential as the BBC attempts to compete in an increasingly crowded marketplace, as younger viewers are attracted by rivals such as Netflix. The move also risks angering ITV by undermining the joint BritBox venture, which is due to launch this autumn priced £5.99 a month and is being pitched as a cheaper additional streaming service for consumers who already subscribe to Netflix.Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s director of content, said: “iPlayer will become the heart of everything we do the gateway to all our programmes – a ‘total TV’ experience, which will bring everything you want from BBC television into one place for the first time.”Despite iPlayer pioneering UK streaming when it launched in 2007, its market share has plummeted in the face of new arrivals, while being hamstrung by regulatory constraints – such as only being able to show programmes for 30 days after broadcast. In August, Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, gave the BBC the go-ahead to increase the amount of time that content is available on iPlayer.In a press release the BBC said it was finally removing “the burdens of excessive regulation” in order to “push further and faster than ever before”. But some independent producers have raised concerns.John McVay, the chief executive of Pact, the body that represents the UK’s independent TV production industry, said in August: “The BBC has consistently sought to strong-arm suppliers into giving the BBC these rights for no compensation and without a proper agreement.“Pact has warned its members three times since April that the BBC has not yet reached an agreement with Pact for its ambitious plans.”Previous changes to established BBC streaming products have not gone smoothly. The broadcaster was criticised for “ignoring its audience” over the decision to turn off its iPlayer radio app and replace it with the BBC Sounds app in an attempt to attract younger listeners.The decision was announced last November but as the switch-off began in September this year, users complained that BBC Sounds was only available on new operating systems including Apple’s iOS 11, Android 5 or Amazon OS 5 or newer, meaning those with older operating systems were unable to use it.A spokesperson for the consumer group Voice of the Listener and Viewer urged the BBC to give more time for the transition. James Purnell, the BBC’s radio and education director, said in a blogpost that supporting older operating systems did not offer “good value for money for licence fee payers”.He said: “If people’s devices aren’t capable of running a supported operating system, in most cases they will still be able to access BBC Sounds on that same device via a web browser (eg Safari, Chrome).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35107b925b9bc4d716df38ef1dbe138daabeded0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f497408b8f80c0184a9c24cf94b5bb9","title":"title deeds covenants hidden conveyancing law","story":"Tom and Lisa Aldiss* had just bought their first home when the demand arrived. A housing association they had never heard of claimed the developer had breached a restrictive covenant by building their house and demanded they pay £45,000 or face legal action.Restrictive covenants appear on the majority of title deeds for properties in the UK and can prohibit certain uses, alterations or developments. Although solicitors are supposed to flag them up, most homeowners remain unaware of them. And those who inadvertently breach a covenant – or buy from a seller who has already breached it – can find themselves liable for life-changing sums.For the Aldisses, it has turned into a legal nightmare. A covenant on the land on which their new house stood forbade any building work without permission from the council.The developer who initially bought the plot failed to seek permission and later ignored a request to pay for release from the covenant. The property was sold on to another builder, who claimed to be unaware of the breach. This builder then sold the completed house to the Aldisses, who are now being pursued by a housing association, the current beneficiary of the covenant.Their solicitor had made them aware of the covenant, but was satisfied that the seller had taken out indemnity insurance to cover any liability. However, that insurance was invalidated because the original developer had been notified of the covenant breach before the policy was purchased.The Aldisses’ starter home is also potentially liable for another astronomical charge – “chancel repair liability”. This ancient burden can require landowners to foot the bill for repairs to the local church, a sum that could reach hundreds of thousands of pounds. The couple have had to buy indemnity insurance to protect against future demands.Thousands of homeowners could, like the Aldisses, be hit by unexpected costs because of antique laws buried in their title deeds. Worse, they can be held liable for arrears accrued by previous owners.Eva Hamilton opened a letter addressed to the previous owner of her home demanding payment of a £100 “rentcharge”. Confusingly, that has nothing to do with ground rent or tenancies. It is an annual sum due to a third party who has no other interest in the property. This is usually a former landowner or developer, or a private company that bought the “rentcharge” as an investment.Although the sums may be small – in Hamilton’s case just £1.50 a year payable to a private company – if a homeowner fails to pay the “rent-charge”, they may end up forfeiting the freehold.Hamilton bought her home six years ago and had never been billed for the charge, which dates from 1887. “I was told that unless I bought it outright for £100 I would be pursued for decades’ worth of charges,” she says.In fact, under the Limitation Act 1980 she is only liable for the past six years. But if she fails to pay, her flat could be seized by the freeholder.The Rentcharges Act 1977 prohibited the creation of new charges, with some exceptions, and most historic ones will be extinguished by 2037.But the act failed to protect homeowners from an even more onerous liability: “estate rentcharge”. This is often levied on owners of freehold properties on an estate with communal amenities, and has the same purpose as a service charge to pay for the upkeep of shared facilities.Paul Hanna received a demand for nearly £700 in “estate rentcharges” from Saxon Weald, the housing association that sold him the freehold to his house in Southwater, West Sussex, in 2016. He already pays a service charge to the management company of the estate but has now discovered that under the transfer deeds of his home, he is liable for both.Frighteningly, freeholders who are pursued for “estate rentcharges” can be charged unspecified sums for unspecified works indefinitely, and face forfeiting their freehold if they don’t pay, unlike leaseholders who are protected by law from unfair service charges. Saxon Weald failed to respond to requests for a comment.The law is inching forward to protect homeowners from archaic liabilities. Until 2013, the owner of a property subject to “chancel repair liability” was liable whether or not they had notice of it when they purchased the property.In 2013, churches were required to enter a notice on the Register of Title to protect their rights, and more than 250 have done so, affecting 12,000 properties. The rule was intended to give a buyer advance warning that payment might have to be made, and means that anyone buying a property without a notice on the title after October 2013 should be safe.As new protections are brought in, new rules can exert a similar stranglehold. Rachel Stevenson and David Hill received a demand for £8,000 from the London Borough of Newham three years after moving into their newbuild home. It was for a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), which is payable on new developments to local authorities since 2010.The developer is supposed to issue an “assumption of liability” notice when applying for planning permission and pay the CIL once they’ve notified the council that works have commenced.In Stevenson and Hill’s case the builder issued the first notice but not the second. It took Newham council two years to get round to issuing him with a demand and, when he failed to respond, it waited a further three years before sending a second bill.By then Stevenson and Hill had bought the house and, since the council had not registered the unpaid CIL with the local land charges register, it was not picked up during conveyancing.Worse, the couple were hit with an additional £2,000 surcharge for the builder’s failure to serve the commencement notice, and £1,000 of late payment charges. If they don’t pay up they may be unable to sell.The council has since acknowledged that its attempt to chase the debt was “untimely” and has waived the £2,000 surcharge, but the couple is still liable for the £5,000 levy plus the escalating late-payment fees and interest. They say they are footing the bill for the council’s inertia.Following contact from the Observer, Newham council says it is reviewing the case.Alison Spark of Thomson Snell \u0026amp Passmore says a vigilant solicitor should identify any expensive burdens that could affect the value or sale of a property. “Searches during the conveyancing process should guard against the hidden costs,” she says.* Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e93f832b29b332d8df5c5bc1d814c88198e8a3e/507_255_1568_941/master/1568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8adc87b3908ba01200241707e4897637","title":"ginger baker a master and monster who split rock music apart","story":"The drummer fought his bandmates, alienated his children and lived a life of turmoil – but had an utterly new vision for what rock music could beThe 2012 documentary film Beware of Mr Baker is a profoundly discomfiting watch. The adjective regularly used to describe its subject is “cantankerous”, but that isn’t really right. Cantankerous sounds like a word you would append to a beloved but grumpy old relation, and – in the film at least – there’s nothing lovable whatsoever about Ginger Baker.Sequestered in his South African compound, he seems authentically horrible: rude, obnoxious, arrogant, dismissive, violent. It doesn’t seem to be an act put on for the camera. His children’s relationship with him is clearly strained – on one occasion, his son recounts, they played a gig together that entailed his father giving the 15-year-old a line of cocaine, then absconding with their fee, leaving him stranded. His latest partner stares blankly and silently at the camera when asked whether he’s a good stepfather. Even the man he describes as “his best friend in the world”, Eric Clapton, seems to regard him with a very wary eye: he “doesn’t know him well”, he says, before describing him as “scary, threatening … difficult”. It’s hard not to find yourself wondering aloud why anyone would want to have made a film about Baker, simply because doing so would have meant spending time in his company.The answer, of course, lay in the music Baker made in the 1960s and 70s. By common consent, he helped to redefine the notion of the rock drummer, elevating the role from that of time-keeping backing musician to a star attraction. Devotees of Ringo Starr and the late Keith Moon – about whose playing Baker was characteristically contemptuous – might argue that he didn’t do it singlehandedly, but there’s no doubt that Baker’s style of playing had an enormous impact.He was also, on occasion, a musical visionary. He was among the first British musicians to cotton on to the revolutionary sound of Afrobeat being pioneered by Fela Kuti. Commendably unwilling simply to decorate his own music with Nigerian inflections, he immersed himself in Kuti’s world, moving to Lagos, joining Africa ’70 and setting up his own recording studio.You could hear Baker’s jazz training on the records he cut with his first band, the Graham Bond Organisation, but he came into his own when he left Bond to form Cream. The gulf between the music on the Graham Bond Organisation’s album The Sound of 65 and Cream’s debut, Fresh Cream – recorded barely a year later – speaks volumes about the speed at which pop was moving in the mid-60s. The former is gritty but musicianly jazz-flecked rhythm and blues the latter is expansive, experimental, heavily improvised and genuinely groundbreaking. You can hear the roots of everything from heavy metal to jam rock to the power trio format subsequently adopted by umpteen bands in its nine tracks.Cream’s free-thinking approach to rock gave Baker space to thrive. Fresh Cream concluded with his track Toad, a five-minute showcase for his talents. Most rock drum solos are indescribably boring, but Toad is thrilling, testament to Baker’s patented cocktail of swing, control and wildness.Cream’s catalogue is filled with examples of Baker’s rhythmic invention – he transformed the single White Room by adding a “Bolero” section in 54 time – and the trio were a sensation, albeit a short-lived one. Before the release of their third album, Wheels of Fire, and barely 18 months after their debut, the band had split. Part of the problem was sheer exhaustion from touring and the band members’ boredom with the ever-increasing volume of their live shows. But you might have predicted the band wouldn’t last long from the start. Baker and bassist Jack Bruce had played together in the Graham Bond Organisation and loathed each other – Bruce had quit after Baker pulled a knife on him – a state of affairs not much helped by Baker’s longstanding heroin problem.Next, he joined Clapton and Steve Winwood in the short-lived supergroup Blind Faith, whose solitary album suffered both from hype and the sense that it was recorded in a rush. An underrated and idiosyncratic writer, as evidenced by Cream’s Blue Condition and Pressed Rat and Warthog, Baker’s Do What You Like had the makings of a charming song, but was allowed to ramble, unfocused, for 15 minutes. Not even a drum solo could save it.Blind Faith barely lasted long enough to complete a US tour, but Baker – frequently the onstage focus rather Winwood or the increasingly reticent Clapton – apparently enjoyed the experience, subsequently attempting to repeat the supergroup formula with Ginger Baker’s Air Force, ominously named after the section of Duke Ellington’s orchestra comprised of heroin addicts. Recorded live, their eponymous debut was muffled, patchy and once again, wildly over-hyped, but it offered up a game and groundbreaking attempt to meld rock with jazz and the African music with which Baker was increasingly obsessed. A second, studio-recorded album also had moments when the fusion of styles gelled perfectly, not least the potent Graham Bond-penned closer 12 Gates of the City, but the Air Force’s music simply wasn’t commercial enough to bear the weight of expectation placed on it, nor the cost of transporting its vast lineup – which at one stage featured three percussionists – around on tour.By 1971, Baker was in Lagos, building a recording studio and collaborating with Fela Kuti, whom he’d known since the early 60s, when Kuti – then studying in London – had begun hanging around Soho’s jazz and blues clubs. A tireless booster of Kuti’s work, Baker had helped him get gigs around London while still a member of Blind Faith. His work with Kuti and Africa ’70 seemed to provide Baker with a respite from his post-Cream role as “superstar drummer”. He got front-cover billing on Fela With Ginger Baker Live! and Kuti’s subsequent studio album Why Black Man Dey Suffer, but what’s striking about both is how seamlessly Baker fitted into Africa ’70, happy for his contributions to be subservient to the band’s fluid, polyrhythmic groove. A subsequent reissue of the former added a live drum duet between Baker and Kuti’s regular percussionist Tony Allen, but for the most part, you wouldn’t have noticed that the man behind Toad was there at all.Kuti returned the favour, appearing on Baker’s solo album Stratavarious, a fantastic psychedelic Afro-rock confection that demonstrated how intuitively Baker grasped Nigerian music, but his African sojourn eventually came to grief. Stories about exactly what happened vary, but the upshot was Baker losing his studio and fleeing the country virtually penniless. He seemed to join yet another “supergroup”, the Baker Gurvitz Army, primarily out of financial necessity. There’s nothing exactly wrong with their three albums of straightforward hard rock, but their contents are a long way from the innovations of Cream or Afrobeat or Stratavarious.After their split, Baker’s life seemed to descend into chaos, shot through with further tales of financial mismanagement and personal turmoil. He played on Hawkwind’s 1980 album Levitation – you can spot him a mile off on Space Chase and closer Dust of Time – but otherwise largely retreated from music. Producer Bill Laswell involved him in the making of Public Image Limited’s acclaimed 1986 album Album and had him record an instrumental solo album, Horses and Trees, that veered from world music fusion to experiments with sampling and scratching. However, by the late 80s, Baker was reduced to placing small ads in LA music magazines, looking for work.He spent the rest of his career iding his time between session work and a succession of intriguing, if uneven, solo projects that lurched between world music (Ginger Baker: African Force), free improvisation (Unseen Rain No Material, a challenging collaboration with saxophonist Peter Brötzmann and others) and jazz: Going Back Home (1994) and Coward of the County (1999) both received critical praise, underlining that, unlike most of his rock peers, Baker could cut it as a straightforward jazz drummer.A brief Cream reunion in 2005 ended unhappily. Baker and Bruce’s enmity had not been dimmed by the passing of time, Bruce wryly suggesting that things might be improved if Baker moved even further away from England than his new home in South Africa. Then came Beware of Mr Baker and a series of promotional interviews for the film that did nothing to undercut the grim image projected in it. It was hard to work out whether Baker was just spectacularly embittered by his experiences in the music business, or whether he’d always been a bit like that.Whatever the reason, Baker was clearly not an easy man to love, or even to like. But he was also an inspired and groundbreaking musician, a drummer other drummers queued to pay homage to, even when their praise was rebuffed. And that’s what Baker should and will be remembered for. “He wanted to advance and challenge himself – isn’t that what we’re all doing this for?” offered John Lydon, decades after the two had collaborated, noting that he was also “a nutter … a monster-raging-crazy-loony”. “We just gelled,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d804f32cc7daed83ba332cae1912732c9ea7d6e6/573_124_4153_2492/master/4153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224f07f763763ddcdd8a782b6cb683c2","title":"a life in pictures ginger baker","story":"From psychedelic rockers Cream in the 1960s to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, see images from across Ginger Baker’s varied career"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_0_6537_3922/master/6537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aee42e8ee5120c99caea0a71d4df2a8","title":"reality tv social media and living your life online with jia tolentino","story":"Jia Tolentino, described as one of the world’s greatest young essayists, discusses how the age of the internet has fundamentally changed who we are.

One alternative would be for MPs to seek to replace him with another prime minister willing to negotiate a Brexit delay with the EU in good faith.Given that a replacement PM could only be elected with the backing of Liberal Democrat MPs and former Tories who have lost the whip for rebelling over Brexit, there has been speculation about whether an anti-Johnson majority could unite behind a respected backbencher like Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman, or even the Speaker, John Bercow.Corbyn will meet other opposition party leaders on Monday to decide the next steps to ensure the government abides with the Benn act.In an interview with the Italian news organisation La Repubblica, McDonnell said that the normal process, in the event of the prime minister losing a no-confidence vote, was for the leader of the opposition to form a government and that most other opposition parties, like the SNP, accepted that.Having someone else lead an interim government “wouldn’t work”, McDonnell went on. “It wouldn’t gain support of Labour MPs, full stop,” he said.In the event of Johnson losing a confidence vote, McDonnell said that Corbyn should be allowed to form a government and “the other opposition parties will then have to make their minds up because if they don’t swing their support behind Jeremy Corbyn, they will be blamed for the no-deal.”Corbyn has said that he wants to call a confidence vote when he has the best chance of winning, and that if be became PM he would form a “strictly time-limited, temporary government” to extend article 50 and then call a general election.Asked if McDonnell’s comments marked a shift in the party’s position, a senior party source said that he was just reflecting reality and that the idea of anyone other than Corbyn leading an interim government was “not a realistic prospect”.In an interview on the Andrew Marr Show, the shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, said that the idea of installing the Speaker as head of an interim government was just a “fantasy football” option and “very unlikely”.But, when asked if she was saying Corbyn would never accept anyone else taking over as caretaker PM, she replied: “I’m not saying that. I just think we’re getting into a level of fantasy around these various permutations of unity governments. It’s just not realistic.”Chakrabarti also said she did not accept claims that there were up to 40 Labour MPs willing to back the deal proposed by Johnson. They would not accept it because it was a “deregulatory deal” and Labour MPs cared about rights, she said.But she did suggest that, if Johnson could negotiate a deal acceptable to the Irish government and the EU, Labour might back it because it would be “something more likely to meet our tests”.Labour MP Lisa Nandy told Sky News that, although she was one of the opposition MPs trying to reach cross-party agreement on an acceptable deal, she did not support what Johnson announced last week because it would put the Good Friday agreement at risk and undermined employment and environmental rights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89da999b6523124127307b2c634e0b324db1ede/0_104_2216_1330/master/2216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63b98fd20e18b87418fd6d2b202858d2","title":"how far away uk eu from reaching brexit deal","story":"Agreement this week unlikely but talks are ongoing and PM is building Commons supportPerhaps. The EU summit starting on 17 October has long been seen as a hard deadline, but EU leaders will not negotiate legal text in the middle of the night and, realistically, for a deal to happen most of the components would have to be in place by next weekend. Emmanuel Macron has floated this Friday as a deadline, although No 10 thinks 14 October will in practice be the last possible moment for a deal.There are two, both relating to Northern Ireland. To avoid a hard border after Brexit, a longstanding goal for both sides, Boris Johnson has produced a plan for a new version of the backstop that would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods while also keeping it in UK customs territory. This means there would have to be some sort of checks on goods crossing the northsouth border. The UK has produced a minimalist blueprint for how these might operate. But the EU is not convinced the plan would work, thinks it would require new infrastructure that would become a terrorist target, and is alarmed that even the UK is admitting the full details would have to be worked out over the next year.The UK plan also involves effectively giving the Democratic Unionist party a veto before these arrangements are introduced, and then every four years when they are renewed. This is unacceptable to the other parties in Northern Ireland and, from the EU’s point of view, means a system designed to protect the integrity of the single market is entirely dependent on the goodwill of Arlene Foster.Who knows, but it is not looking likely.On the plus side, Johnson has got the DUP and most of the die-hard Tory Brexiters from the European Research Group to support his plan, which means he is close to having a Commons majority for it. It is also undoubtedly true that a no-deal Brexit would be damaging to both sides, which implies that a compromise should theoretically be possible.But at stake are fundamental issues (essentially, whether it is possible to leave the EU customs union and still have most of the frictionless border advantages of being in), not minor customs technicalities, as Johnson claimed in his party conference speech. And if the UK were to compromise further, as the EU is demanding, the fragile ToryDUP coalition that Johnson has assembled behind his plan would start to crumble.Both sides intend to keep talking this week, but that does not necessarily mean they are convinced they can get a deal. The EU does not want to be seen to be pushing a member out (its harsh treatment of Greece during the eurozone crisis was a propaganda bonanza for anti-Europeans). And Johnson wants to be seen to be doing all he can to secure an agreement, to give credibility to claims (already being rehearsed by the Tories) that the EU would be to blame for no deal.No one knows for sure, although supporters of the act, which will require the PM to “seek to obtain” a three-month Brexit extension under article 50 by 19 October if the government has not passed a deal, believe the legislation is robust.No 10 says Johnson will obey the law. But he has also said he will not resign and would rather be “dead in a ditch” than extend Brexit, and his aides have claimed they are considering various unspecified schemes to subvert the act, which cannot guarantee an extension anyway because the EU could always say no (although that is thought unlikely).In practice, this is another matter that could get settled in the supreme court. But it may be significant that in private the PM’s team is now more willing than it was to accept an extension might have to happen. They used to think it would be electoral suicide for the Tories, but now they believe Johnson could win anyway, provided he was seen to have tried to deliver Brexit by the end of October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Algol is located in the constellation of Perseus and is one of only a few stars that can be seen to change brightness with the naked eye. This extraordinary characteristic led our ancestors to associate it with the severed head of the gorgon Medusa being held in Perseus’s hand. The name Algol derives from an Arabic word that translates into ghoul or demon. Algol’s brightness changes because there is a smaller, dimmer star in orbit around it. Every 2.87 days, that smaller star passes in front of its larger, brighter companion, blocking out some of its light. From beginning to end, these eclipses last for about 10 hours. The chart shows the view looking east at 20.55 GMT on 8 October. At this time, Algol will be in mid-eclipse and its brightness will be less than half its normal value.

In between, she ran up a 12-race winning streak that included Classics, two Arcs and two wins in the King George at Ascot.As Grimthorpe, the racing manager for Enable’s owner, Prince Khalid Abdullah, said: no complaints.But there was a brief moment, about a quarter of a mile from home, when a historic third Arc for Enable felt real and immediate. Dettori had settled the 4-6 favourite several lengths off the lead as Ghaiyyath, who had worked his way to the front after three furlongs, set a solid pace on ground that had turned soft after steady rain on Saturday and into Sunday morning.Enable made some progress towards the leaders in the “false” straight before the turn from home, and Ghaiyyath then went rapidly in the opposite direction, a sign, perhaps, that the ground was more testing than expected.She was in front two out and 40,000 spectators started to shout her home, but she did not move away and suddenly the red colours of Waldgeist and Pierre-Charles Boudot were finishing with purpose down the middle of the track.It was clear a furlong out that Boudot had enough track left to work with and Waldgeist took control 50 yards from the line before crossing it a length-and-three-quarters to the good. Sottsass, the French Derby winner, was third with Aidan O’Brien’s two runners, Japan and Magical, fourth and fifth.Waldgeist was the same distance behind Enable when he finished fourth in last year’s Arc, two lengths away in third behind John Gosden’s mare in the King George in July and no less than 13 lengths adrift of her in the Breeders’ Cup Turf last November.But Fabre’s five-year-old, who extended the trainer’s record haul in the race to eight wins, was a worthy winner on the day, simply outstaying the favourite on testing ground after the unpredictable Parisian climate decided to take a hand in the proceedings.Enable’s retirement from racing has yet to be confirmed but she had a hard race here and is most unlikely to see a track again. Waldgeist too seems likely to go out at the top, though he will be given a few of days to see how he comes out of this race.“I always hope for the very best when I run my horses in the Arc,” Fabre said. “With Waldgeist, he carried my highest expectation.“I knew the ground would be very testing, but I looked back to his days as a two-year-old, when he won in the heavy, and that made me more confident that he would finish his race off well.“I’m very proud that Waldgeist managed to beat such a fantastic mare, it’s well deserved in some ways. What can I say? I’m delighted.”A wet morning had given way to a warm, dry evening as the fans made their way out into the Bois de Boulogne, but as far as many of them were concerned, the damage had been done on Saturday night. The drying conditions arrived much too late for Enable and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, which marks its centenary next year, is still a race without a three-time winner.It was Grimthorpe, again, who best summed up the mood as one of the great racing careers ended with the anticipation of a glorious finale confounded.“The expectation is so enormous with these things,” he said, “and the wave of goodwill and good wishes that we all had was unbelievable, really. She’s been an unbelievable filly and we love her to death, and we don’t love her any less now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e292f7f00d268db9bb12860f4a57b6e4ee1ca5/0_19_5311_3186/master/5311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83b7086e6bd92b877021e04a4c3aa93","title":"england expected to name chris silverwood as new head coach","story":"England are poised to name their new head coach for the men’s national team, with Chris Silverwood widely expected to emerge as the successful candidate.Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, has spent the weekend mulling over who should replace the now departed Trevor Bayliss and is believed to have plumped for the man who has spent the past two years as the team’s fast-bowling coach. Silverwood, 44, may be well known to the setup in his current role but has always had designs on the top job, having previously been head coach at Essex and masterminded the county’s first championship title for 25 years in 2017.Such credentials were cited by Giles back in February when he talked up Silverwood as a contender for the impending vacancy and stated his desire to appoint an Englishman given just one, Peter Moores, had been full‑time head coach (twice) in the past 20 years. So while Gary Kirsten flew in from South Africa for an interview last week boasting a strong CV at international level, and other overseas hopefuls including Ottis Gibson and Andrew McDonald were similarly considered, the original home-grown frontrunner has seemingly won out.The decision may have been less clearcut had Alec Stewart, the Surrey director of cricket, not withdrawn from the process because of family commitments. Kirsten, who is down to coach Welsh Fire in the Hundred next year, had also expressed reservations over the schedule.Confirmation of Silverwood would see England able to make an immediate fresh start when they travel to New Zealand at the end of the month, a tour of five Twenty20s and two Tests that he was already down to oversee in an interim capacity had Giles not completed the recruitment process in time.While he maintains a low profile, the former Yorkshire and England seamer is highly regarded in the current setup and not least by the Test captain, Joe Root, who has encouraged him to take a more central role in team talks and meetings over the past 12 months.The pair’s growing relationship will define how the Test team fare in the coming years, with Root looking to challenge for the World Test Championship and regain the Ashes in 2021‑22. Eoin Morgan’s limited-overs team have T20 World Cup campaigns in 2020 and 2021.Graham Thorpe is expected to remain as batting coach, leaving two assistant roles now vacant. Paul Collingwood has previously held one of these on a contract basis and may now be appointed full-time, while Silverwood’s expected promotion will leave a vacancy overseeing the bowlers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16b1801f3253892c5b45a76df886be8d5552bfb4/141_149_4347_2608/master/4347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47a8cca8ba41d30a23e03dce018569c3","title":"oakland raiders chicago bears nfl josh jacobs london","story":"A pumped-up Jon Gruden was already bouncing up and down by the time he started on the locker room victory speech to his Oakland Raiders players. “I don’t have a disco here but let’s all start dancing,” he hollered. “I’m 56 years old and I’ve never had more fun than tonight. I’m so proud of you, you don’t know. You just showed that you can beat anyone, anywhere on any fucking time zone. Now have the whole week off.”With apologies for his French, the American coach had put his finger on it. His Raiders had come back to win in Indianapolis last weekend, but doing it against play-off contenders the Chicago Bears, late on, and in London, seemed like a statement worth commemorating. The Raiders have played in London twice before and lost both times. Last year, after a humbling defeat to the Miami Dolphins, Gruden said the main lesson he had learned was that jetlag mattered. This year the Raiders had been in the UK since Monday, the Bears only rocked up on Thursday. It was clear which of the two sides was the sleepier.A late, majestic leap into the endzone by player of the game Josh Jacobs meant the Raiders came away 24-21 winners over the Bears at the first NFL London game of the year and the first ever at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium.The brand-new ground, the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States, had a good night itself creating a constant spectacle of light and noise, even during play. The visitors liked it too, with Bears coach Matt Nagy describing it as “phenomenal”. It was pretty much the only positive adjective he used in his post-game remarks.Whether suffering from the time difference or not, the Bears didn’t turn up in the first half. Their normally redoubtable defence, that had conceded just five touchdowns in their first four matches, gave up two in five minutes in the second quarter. They weren’t helped by the enforced departure of defensive end Akiem Hicks with an elbow injury, but there was another player missing too. After a pre-game that had concerned itself with the trade which saw Khalil Mack leave the Raiders for the Bears last year (Mack calling the fixture a ‘grudge match’) the star linebacker failed to impose himself on the Bears’ defensive plays.The extra irony of all this was that it was Mack’s departure that helped usher in Jacobs’ arrival , the Raiders taking a first round draft pick from the Bears and using it to select the University of Alabama running back. Jacobs scored the opening touchdown, dancing through the centre of the Bears defence to bring an end to a 10 play, 90-yard drive.His ability to run with the ball then became a release valve as the Bears rediscovered their appetite and piled on the pressure in the third quarter, coming back from 17-0 down at half-time to lead 20-17. (For the record it was Mack who gobbled up the interception that eventually led to David Montgomery’s opening touchdown).There were topsy-turvy moments, interceptions from the Bears’ stand-in quarterback Chase Daniels, one of which was contentiously ruled out after he was adjudged to have been hit after releasing. There was also a fake punt from the Raiders that almost went horribly wrong only for the referees to overturn a ruling on a fumble. Then came the final moment of reckoning, a 14-play progression that moved from Oakland’s three-yard line remorselessly up the field. Jacobs ran the ball on four of those plays. Finally it was first down on the Chicago two-yard line, and quarterback Derek Carr handed the ball off to Jacobs. He fixed his eyes on the heart of the line once more, the Bears by now ravenous. But instead of shimmying he hurled himself as much as five foot off the ground to clear the perimeter security and seal the game.“He proved a lot tonight,” said Gruden of the rookie on whom he had put his faith. “He made some great runs. We’ve been talking about our young players since they’ve been here, the kind of effort that they provide and the smartness that they play with. We’ve got a good feeling going right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b26ee3353ba2eb74f232be7c54b3d80b8520960/379_0_1940_1164/master/1940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8263caaa19ef54f9d3c7c40cea5580c9","title":"variant 31 new oxford street london review immersive theatre zombies","story":"New Oxford Street, LondonIn an elaborate game of hide and seek, you have to avoid the marauding undead – but the fear and the fun soon fizzle outA hand grabs my ankle and a veiny arm slips back into the darkness. My lights turn yellow. I have 90 seconds to find a healing station or I’m dead. I sprint up the narrow staircase and just make it, only to miss out because of the polite queue waiting to be resurrected.This new, immersive zombie survival game is framed by a tale of scientific experiments gone wrong. More theme park than theatre, it survives on novelty and adrenaline. Essentially, it’s an elaborate game of laser tag.A paper-thin plot casts us as guinea pigs in medical trials.

Is that a bite mark on my leg?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14a0b07177d5c9a8e3600bd56924aa2c96caecf/527_486_2930_1758/master/2930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73689e6011370d9636fca7372d0478a2","title":"chasing the goldfinch visiting the glamorous locations of the movie","story":"If you fancy following in the footsteps of Theo Decker, the dynamic and charming lead of The Goldfinch, we’ve picked the best things to do in the film’s three starring citiesThe main event that shatters the life of the young protagonist, Theo Decker, occurs at the politan Museum of Art while viewing a captivating yet haunting painting of a goldfinch. You won’t find the titular 17th-century painting, Carel Fabritius’ The Goldfinch, here. In real life it hangs in the Mauritshuis in The Hague – but you will find canvases by his master, Rembrandt, along with more modern works by the likes of Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso and David Hockney. You should also check out the elegant Frick Collection, which is also a must-see for art lovers in the city – not least because in late 2013, The Goldfinch was exhibited at the Frick for a few months.Theo is initially taken in by the affluent Barbour family, who live in an elegant high-rise apartment on prestigious Park Avenue. Try Upper East Side institution, French bistro Le Veau d’Or – or sample the cuisine somewhere equally refined, such as La Grenouille, or power-lunch favourite 21 Club. For sheer class, you can’t go wrong with cocktails at the Rainbow Room, whose Bar SixtyFive, at the top of the Rockefeller Center, is definitely the kind of place one would sip a Manhattan.Fancy yourself as an antique collector? While the film’s antique shop, Hobart and Blackwell, doesn’t actually exist, you’ll find the fabulous Manhattan Art and Antiques Center on 2nd and 56th. It’s a treasure trove of artefacts – from furniture (Hobie’s speciality) to porcelain, silver, fine art and more – spread over three floors. Furnish Green, on Broadway, is where to find mid-century modern pieces, art deco table lamps, and quirkier items such as classic comics.Without giving too much away, our young protagonist finds himself in the outskirts of Sin City, living with his father (Larry) and his father’s girlfriend (Xandra). There may not be much to do in the suburbs, but head to the Vegas Strip, where you can visit the Bellagio, one of Las Vegas’ most popular hotel casinos. Tourists flock to the impressive, daily fountain displays, but other draws include the magnificent collection of glass sculptures in the lobby by artist Dale Chihuly. If you want to try your luck at the tables, you can head over to the MGM Grand where you’ll also find 20 in-house bars and restaurants, including fine dining at Atelier de Joël Robuchon, and Wolfgang Puck’s Bar \u0026amp Grill. Theo and his new friend Boris clearly prefer steak – they steal one from a local supermarket. If steak is also your thing, make a beeline for somewhere classic such as the Golden Steer, one of the oldest restaurants in town, which serves up prime rib and filet mignon. Or treat yourself to melt-in-the-mouth Kobe beef at SW Steakhouse in the Wynn hotel. In search of a little culture in between the casinos? Centaur Art Galleries displays a range of works by artists as erse as Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali and Norman Rockwell.We won’t spoil how Theo Decker comes to be in a hotel in Amsterdam, but if the sight of the city’s signature canals appeals to you, there are several elegant waterside establishments worth checking into when you visit. Try the Pulitzer its bar was voted the best hotel bar in the city in 2019, with cocktails inspired by Ernest Hemingway. Or visit the Dylan, a stylish enclave in the hip, independent shopping area, the Nine Streets. The restaurant at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam is even named after the Pulitzer prize-winning book that the movie is based on the Goldfinch Brasserie serves elegant fare, including oysters and beef tartare.Chasers of The Goldfinch should be sure to visit some of the city’s magnificent museums and immerse themselves in the dramatic paintings adored by the film’s characters. The Rijksmuseum is possibly the greatest, where you’ll find Vermeer’s Milkmaid and Rembrandt’s The Night Watch. The Van Gogh Museum is home to Sunflowers, The Yellow House and several self-portraits. And, of course, you can visit the Mauritshuis in The Hague to see the title painting at the centre of the story.Based on the Pulitzer prize-winning novel, The Goldfinch is released nationwide on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5555234efe6a4751ef29cd592adaf2385797382d/713_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d0c75794a4a38bb52e8e387f401080","title":"ansel elgort nicole kidman finn wolfhard whos who in the goldfinch","story":"Who do you cast in the movie adaptation of a Pulitzer prize-winning novel?

Portrush offers two options, West Strand (usually bigger) and East Strand, and like the rest of the breaks along this coastline they’re oriented in a generally northerly direction, which means the region’s prevailing winds are offshore, creating wonderful “clean” waves.Lessons and board hire From £30 for two hours, boards £12 a day at Troggs Surf School.Where to eat Check out the surf action with coffee and cake at Babushka Kitchen Café above West Strand.Where to stay Maddybenny Farm (camping from £7.50 adult, under-10s £5) offers quiet, family-friendly camping close to Portrush.The isle of Lewis and Harris has some of the most consistent waves in northern Europe thanks to its exposed location on the eastern edge of the Atlantic. And because of the Gulf Stream, the water isn’t as cold as you might expect (as high as 16C in the autumn). Add magnificent white sand beaches to that and if you catch it when the sun’s shining on a clean swell, you’ll consider the journey well worthwhile. Crowds are not an issue here and there’s usually a friendly vibe in the water, but bear in mind the isolation of the breaks when surfing in more challenging conditions, or if you’re inexperienced – novices should certainly be wary of going it alone.Lessons and board hire Adults from £45, children from £35, boards from £15 a day at Surf Lewis.Where to eat The nearby Uig Sands restaurant has superb sea views and is famed for its smoked Scottish salmon.Where to stay Ardroil Campsite (01851 672248, no website) is a basic community-run site with a toiletshowerkitchen block situated above the beach it operates on a donation system.A gorgeous swathe of pale sand and crystal-clear sea curves from Sennen Cove up towards Gwynver Beach, and provides the most consistent beach breaks in Cornwall (although Gwynver’s bigger breaks are better left to experienced wave riders). Sennen crams a village, surf shop, surf school, beach restaurant and busy car park between the sea, the cliffs and the steep sand dunes, and it’s always a hive of activity – but somehow there always seem to be enough waves to go around. The south end of the beach, where the waves are always smaller and more user-friendly, is perfect for beginners.Lessons and board hire £30 for two hours at Sennen Surfing Centre boards £13 a day from Sennen Beach.Where to eat The Surf Beach Bar, which as the name suggests is right above the beach.Where to stay The family-run Trevedra Farm campsite (from £7.50 adult, £4 child + £3.50 tent pitch) above Gwynver has marvellous coastal views.Surfers have been riding the waves here since the 1960s, thanks to its proximity to Edinburgh and its reasonably mellow right-hand point break at the south end of the bay on good swells. This breaks over a cobble and sand bottom and can be pretty shallow at low tides, so you need to be reasonably competent to tackle it. There’s also a left-hander breaking off a sandbar at the north end of the bay. Autumn sees water temperatures at their highest – a balmy 14C.Lessons and board hire £35 for two hours, boards £6.50 an hour at St Vedas Surf Shop.Where to eat Try Graze Coffee \u0026amp Chocolate House in Dunbar – the toasted Belgian waffles with a warm chocolate shot are particularly appealing after a cold session in the North Sea.Where to stay Meadowhead’s Mortonhall park has static caravans above the beach, but its campsite at nearby Belhaven Bay in the John Muir Country Park is a more attractive option (two people + tent from £19.80).This is the first place I ever surfed, and I’ve been riding the waves here with Nick Noble and Gary Rogers, the affable owners of the beachside surf shop and kit hire businesses, since 1979. The inclusive, down-to-earth vibe I encountered back then is still evident today as surfers of all abilities enjoy the beach breaks either side of the Victorian pier, and nearby there are some of the best and most challenging reef breaks to be found in England. Above the beach, one of the world’s oldest water-powered funicular railways runs up the sea cliffs to the neat streets of Saltburn-by-the-Sea, built under instruction from God by steel magnate and Quaker Henry Pease in the 1860s.Lessons and board hire £30 for two hours, boards £5 an hour at Saltburn Surf .Where to eat Watch the surf action with coffee and cake at the seafront Camfields Espresso Bar.Where to stay A few miles down the coast at Robin Hood’s Bay (which also gets surf), Bay Ness Farm (from £10 a night) has some of the best sea views in Yorkshire.It can be a bit of a zoo here on a good swell (the best waves tend to occur around low tide) but with so many surfers about, the buzz is reassuring if you’re a novice. If you’re looking to escape the crowds that’s easy enough – just leg it north up the huge expanse of Perran Sands, where you’ll find beach break peaks that are far less busy than the main beach, but beware of rips on bigger swells. There’s also a good right-hander breaking off Ligger Point at the very north end of Perran Sands, although it’s a slog to get there.Lessons and board hire £30 for two hours, boards from £7 a day at Piran Surf.Where to eat The Watering Hole is the obvious spot – it’s literally on the beach.Where to stay Tollgate Farm (from £5.50 adult, £2.50 child + £7 tent pitch) has access to Perran Sands through the dunes above the beach.Woolacombe is a beginner-friendly surf spot with mellow beach breaks, although it will certainly appeal to experienced surfers looking for bigger swells – especially as Croyde, the other local spot, is invariably far busier. At high tide a right breaks off the rocks at the northern end of the beach, which is what attracts experienced wave riders, and there are some decent low-tide peaks to be found in little Combesgate Beach just a bit further north. Most of the action at Woolacombe is right in front of the town, but since the beach stretches south for three miles you can avoid the inevitable crowds with a bit of a walk.Lessons and board hire £38 for two hours, boards from £6 a day at Hunter. Where to eat The Red Barn, which opened in early 2019, is in a prime location right above the beach.Where to stay Bay View Farmers campsite (from £7.50 adult, £3 child + £17 tent pitch) is a small, family-run site above the bay. The consistent beach breaks found here attract everyone from boogie boarders to longboarders. The peaks at Hillend, at the northern end of the three-mile strand, are the easiest to access and therefore the busiest, and you’ll always find surfers enjoying picnics and barbecues or just hanging out in the car park in the dunes above the beach. On bigger swells, paddling out at Langennith can be a real mission, with line after line of white water rolling relentlessly shorewards, so you’ll need some experience to attempt them. Avoid overcrowded waves by walking south towards Rhossili and, if you have the energy after surfing, climb Rhossili Downs above the beach for some of the best coastal views in Wales.Lessons and board hire From £22 at Llangennith Surf School, boards £12 a day at PJ’s Surf Shop.Where to eat Eddy’s Café at Hillend campsite (see below) is the most convenient après-surf hangout.Where to stay Hillend Caravan \u0026amp Camping Park (tent for family of five or up to three adults from £21) above the beach is an appealing spot, but it can get very busy. One of the most accessible beaches in Pembrokeshire, two-mile-long Newgale has parking above most of its length, with the main surf action opposite the surf shopschool and campsite at the north end. There are beach break peaks all along it, and on smaller swells they’re pretty mellow – ideal for beginners and longboarders – but once it gets above head-high, paddling out is excruciatingly hard work. When I surf here I take time to scan the length of the beach before deciding where to paddle out, since a quick recce will invariably reveal a peak or two with few if any surfers on it.Lessons and board hire £35 for three hours at The Big Blue Experience, boards from £6 an hour at Newsurf.Where to eat Sands Café is conveniently located near the surf school.Where to stay Newgale Campsite (£8 adult, £4 child) at the north end of the beach is literally seconds from the surf.This is a vast stretch of sand and shingle at the southern tip of the lovely Llŷn peninsula, with beach breaks along its length plus a small reef at the north-west end of the bay, which will interest more experienced surfers. The beach break peaks along the rest of the bay are ideal for beginners (I did a lot of my early wave riding here) although you’ll need to watch out for rips on bigger swells – there’s a healthy and talented population of experienced local surfers ready to rip when a good swell hits. Porth Neigwl is known as Hell’s Mouth in English, but expect to hear Welsh being spoken out in the surf the Llŷn peninsula is a hub of Welsh culture.Lessons and board hire £35 for two hours, boards £10 a day at West Coast Surf Shop in Abersoch, three miles to the east.Where to eat There’s nothing at the beach, but Mickey’s Boatyard \u0026amp Beach Café in Abersoch is a good post-surf option.Where to stay Treheli Farm campsite (tent pitch £15) is right above the beach.

As it prepares for its final voyage, passengers and crew recall its legacyIn winter, it rests at the waterfront, where its enormous steel bow – painted a distinctive hue known as “international orange” – provides a photo-friendly backdrop to the Dark Mofo Winter Feast. In summer, it embarks for Antarctica, carrying scientists and supplies on multiple voyages across the Southern Ocean to the Australian Antarctic Division’s four research stations.Whether you’re a Hobart local or simply an occasional visitor to the city, the RSV Aurora Australis icebreaker will be a familiar sight.The upcoming summer season, which begins in late October, will be the Aurora’s last. Thirty years after sliding down the slipways at Carrington in New South Wales, it will be retired from service – replaced by a multimillion-dollar vessel currently in the final stages of construction in Romania.To find a name for the new icebreaker, the Australian government invited schoolchildren across the country to submit their suggestions. The eventual winner – Nuyina, which is the palawa kani word for the southern lights – has been welcomed as a wholly appropriate choice. Not only does it acknowledge the longstanding connection between Tasmanian Aboriginal people and the southern lights, it also continues the naming tradition that was begun back in 1911 when Sir Douglas Mawson set out for Antarctica aboard the steam yacht SY Aurora, and has been most recently held by the much-loved Aurora Australis.By all measures, the RSV Nuyina will be an improvement. It has larger fuel and cargo capacity than the Aurora, is fitted with state-of-the-art scientific equipment, and will have significantly greater icebreaking capability.But humans – even those who tend towards reason and hard data – can develop strong emotional attachments to ships, and there is a distinct sense of nostalgia around the Aurora’s final season.Professor Matt King, head of geography and spatial sciences at the University of Tasmania, made just a single voyage on the Aurora, as a PhD student in 1998, but the experience has stuck with him.“I was seasick from the moment we left the Derwent River until we arrived in the sea ice four days later. Aside from one brief, over-optimistic appearance in the mess, I stayed in my bunk, fed grated apple by a kind colleague. Once we got to the sea ice and the ocean flattened out, it was an entirely different experience – the icebergs, penguins and whales were incredible. For some of the time I had the job of estimating iceberg dimensions from the bridge. But otherwise it was amazing sightseeing and taking photos.”Other researchers, such as Patti Virtue from the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies, have made multiple voyages on the Aurora Australis. “I’m not even sure how many,” she laughs. “It must be around 10. Most of those have been long summer voyages for krill research and oceanographic work, but two were winter voyages, which are logistically much harder.”Since her first voyage in 1992, Virtue has witnessed significant social and cultural shifts onboard the Aurora. While she admits there are still a few regrets among expeditioners about the removal of the ship’s onboard bar, known as the Husky Bar, there have also been some positive changes.“There’s much better gender balance. The first time I went on a voyage there were only three women and about 60 men, but now it’s much closer to 50-50. And at my first medical, the doctor looked at me – I was very small and slender – and said ‘you’re not going on a pleasure cruise, you know …’”But it’s not just scientists who have braved the shared berths of the Aurora. Since the early 1980s, the Australian Antarctic Division has awarded an annual arts fellowship, enabling people from the creative industries to experience Antarctica.Recipients have included Australian children’s laureate Alison Lester, who wrote and illustrated the picture book Sophie Scott Goes South based on her experiences composer and conductor Gordon Hamilton whose symphony Far South, featuring field recordings of ice, ocean and whales, will be premiered jointly by the Tasmanian and Melbourne Symphony Orchestras and the London Mozart Players in March 2020 and writer Favel Parrett, who voyaged to Casey Station in 2012 and used her time on the Aurora to inform her 2014 novel When the Night Comes.Parrett understands the new ship is a marked improvement, but she says the Aurora Australis is a “workhorse that has kept thousands of passengers and crew safe. I grew to love her and her crew while I sailed with her – and I am very sad I won’t get another chance to walk her decks.”The Australian Antarctic Division has confirmed that when the RSV Nuyina begins service, the Arts Fellowship program will continue. What is less certain is the future of the Aurora Australis itself. While the vessel will be forever associated with the work of the AAD, it is owned and operated by P\u0026ampO Maritime. Beyond 2020, the fate of the ship lies with them, and as yet there has been no confirmation of what that might be.Many of the P\u0026ampO crew have been with the Aurora for years. Gerry O’Doherty is the Chief Mate and Master – the man with ultimate command and responsibility for the vessel – having worked his way up the ranks from the position of Integrated Rating (IR), where he began basic maintenance and lookout duties 20 years ago.“I think everybody’s apprehensive. We’re all very attached to the ship and to the work it does. The ship is like a second home, and the people are like a second family. Saying goodbye to that will be difficult. It’s like our own micro-community sometimes, with people from all over the world. It’s a tiny melting pot of humanity isolated in the Southern Ocean.”Marine biologist and former deputy voyage leader Sarah Laverick, who has travelled on the Aurora Australis four times, understands that sense of community better than most. On her second voyage, she met the man who later became her husband, and earlier this year published Through Fire and Ice (Pan Macmillan Australia) a non-fiction book that tells many of the stories from the Aurora’s 30-year history.Through Fire and Ice focuses on the more dramatic moments in the vessel’s history, including two onboard fires, a grounding near Mawson station, and a role in the rescue of the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy.In the book’s introduction, Laverick acknowledges that everyone associated with the ship has their own favourite story – whether that’s a first-timer experiencing the King Neptune ceremony (an initiation rite for people crossing 60 degrees south for the first time, which usually requires kissing a fish), a galley chef working through the 1000kg of potatoes required for each voyage, or an experienced expeditioner winning the onboard first iceberg sweep.“I’ve got so many special memories,” says Laverick. “Seeing a group of orcas surface with a calf was amazing. So was seeing an aurora australis from the Aurora Australis – standing on the deck watching the sky with lots of other people. It’s hard to pick just one though. It’s everything. The Aurora is far more than the sum of her parts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f86e4d65b601f834a0c2a8a6bd2625bf28e47a0/317_580_5523_3313/master/5523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880e689ef3a454c50ee6520148a6d9fc","title":"strictly come dancing shirley ballas so many people have tried to stop me","story":"The queen of TV’s biggest dance show on the sexists, ageists and other bullies she has known – plus the ‘curse of Strictly’It is the heels I see first – towering, spiky, perhaps not ideal driving footwear – as Shirley Ballas gets out of her shiny red Porsche. I have been waiting on the doorstep of her house, feeling a little scruffy. This is compounded when we get inside: it is the most spotless home I have ever seen. It almost feels a little unreal, like a film set, as if I have stepped into a Ballas biopic (and someone should do one) where our heroine is sitting, looking perfect in tight denim, having very definitely made it.Ballas came to widespread public attention in 2017, at the age of 56, when she was made head judge of the TV dance competition Strictly Come Dancing. Now it seems the inevitable crowning achievement in an unstoppable career propelled by grit and talent, although she says it was “a total shock”.The 17th series of Strictly has just started – it is Ballas’s third – and there is no sign that it is losing its sheen. It is a “magical” show, she says. “I think it’s got everything – it’s funny, it’s got glitz and glamour. You watch these people go through this emotional journey every single week and what you see is real. It’s not staged.”I tell her that I love that one of the biggest shows on TV is female-led – it is presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, while the production team is run by women. “Well, I think they lead it better than men,” says Ballas with a smile.We talk about how the quality of the dancing this series seems so high – “Sending somebody home each week is not going to be easy,” she says – and about whether it is fair to pit people who have never danced before against former pop stars: “If everybody was the same level, could you imagine how boring it would be?” She says she was “very sad” when the former ballerina Darcey Bussell decided not to return as a judge, but that she was “absolutely thrilled” when Motsi Mabuse, whom she has known for 20 years, got the job. “We have the same sense of humour, we’re on the same page, she’s from the same industry.” She used to judge Mabuse in competitions. “She was just like this bottle of champagne – full of bubbles and sparkle when she danced.”I mention the so-called Strictly curse, whereby some celebrities end up leaving their marriages for their dance partners. I have always wondered whether the producers are dismayed at such scandal rocking a family show, or pleased that it makes it more talked-about. “That question I couldn’t answer that’s above my pay grade,” she says. Is it inevitable that people fall in love when they dance together? “You mean to tell me in your office that’s never happened? But ours happens to be on TV, on one of the biggest TV shows, and so it’s just magnified. If you go into any industry, it happens all the time and it’s not a big deal. But it seems to be when it happens on Strictly.” Does everyone gossip about it behind the scenes? She smiles, hard as a diamond. “I am there to judge a dance competition: I’m there to judge your footwork, your rhythm, how you look and how you are. I am not there to judge your private life.”Ballas grew up in Merseyside, raised by her single mother, Audrey her father left when she was two – “Not a penny was given ... not even a pair of shoes” – along with her older brother, David. Audrey, to whom Ballas is extremely close, took every job she could. She worked in a chocolate factory and went for a job as a forklift-truck driver there because it paid more. Audrey must have been the only woman, all 5ft of her, driving one of their forklifts in the 60s. It probably goes some way to explaining her daughter’s determination.When Ballas was seven, she went to Brownies one night and noticed an adult ballroom-dancing class next door. She remembers standing on tiptoes to look through the window. “I went in and asked the man: ‘Do you do this for children?’ He said: ‘We’re starting on Saturday.’” Ballas was hooked instantly. “It’s the love of music – the minute it goes, I can’t keep my feet still. I just feel like I need to keep moving and I just love everything about it. I think dancing was a way of showing your femininity and, through the years, your strength, because it’s a male-dominated industry ... to still be standing in my industry today is huge, with the amount of people who’ve tried to stop me getting where I’m going.”She started competing when she was 10. When she was 14, she moved to Yorkshire so she could be paired up with the young British ballroom champion, Nigel Tiffany. It wasn’t difficult to leave home, she says: by now it was her dream to become a professional dancer. “I just knew that we didn’t have the resources,” she says. They didn’t have a car, or spare money, so ferrying her around the country to training sessions and competitions wasn’t an option. “My mum said I was a very logical thinker.”At 16, Ballas and Tiffany moved to London and got engaged, but Ballas’s dance teacher advised her to have a try-out with another dancer, Sammy Stopford. Tiffany broke off their engagement. (He is now her financial adviser and one of her dearest friends. Stopford – whom she left for her second husband a few years later – lives on her road.)She and Stopford won lots of major titles, but then she met Corky Ballas, while she and Stopford were teaching in the US. Corky was handsome and charismatic – and her head was turned. Their son Mark, born when she was 25, was a “pleasant surprise”, but at that time, she says, most professional dancers didn’t have children – or, if they did, their careers ended. “I said to my mum: ‘There’s just no way I’m going to be able to do this.’”Her mother stepped in, looking after Mark while Ballas and Corky travelled the world to compete, although often she would take him with them. “It was very, very difficult,” she says. “But you’re young, you’re striving for your own career. My mum was there, she took care of him.” It helped, she says, that Mark “came out of the womb dancing. If the fridge light went on, he thought he was on stage. He loved to dress up. He got our industry.”The Ballases won the International Latin American Dance championship when she was 35 she had won it with Stopford for the first time at 23. She retired from competition soon after. Was it hard to walk away? “No. At 36 – and Mark was 11 – it was enough.” She had always taught and given demonstrations to earn a living, so she threw herself into this. They also took in the two children – Derek and Julianne Hough – of family friends (they are now renowned dancers in the US). Mark was showing signs of becoming a professional dancer, too.When she refers to her children, she means Mark and the Hough siblings, but also her niece, Mary, whom she helped raise after the suicide of her brother in 2003, at the age of 44 (Mary lost her mother not long afterwards). What was the effect of David’s death on the family? “I don’t think my mother will ever get over it,” she says quietly. “Neither of us. He was very much the protector of the family. He was always the one who stood fast behind me, and then suddenly he wasn’t there.” She blamed herself, she says. They knew David was depressed, but not what it meant. “We didn’t know anything about mental health,” she says. “There just wasn’t access. There was nothing on TV, there was nothing to read.” Ballas had persuaded their mother to visit her in London, leaving David alone they had no idea he was feeling suicidal. “I’ll live with that for ever.” Tears spring in her eyes. “I’m going to get upset, sorry.” What she can do now, she says, her voice trembling, “is campaign for the good of men’s mental health”.It hadn’t been long since she and Corky had broken up. Growing up without a father meant “there was no gauge, really – what you’re looking for when you get married, how should a man treat you? I didn’t have any scale. So, you know, if you were badly treated, to me it was acceptable, when in actual fact, what I’m realising now, is that it wasn’t.” Was she badly treated? “I won’t go into that part,” she says.She met her current partner, the actor Danny Taylor, when they were doing panto last Christmas. “I never, ever thought in my lifetime I would meet a man who, with the exception of my brother …” She doesn’t finish the sentence. “He’s just a really, really good man. He’s definitely restored some confidence in me that perhaps I had when David was alive, but I haven’t had since.”She doesn’t strike me as someone with low confidence. “Lower than you would imagine,” she says. “All the time. Even on Strictly, I can’t deal with somebody telling me I look lovely. It’s a personal thing for me.” Being a dancer must give you an unusual amount of awareness about the way you look. “Of course,” she says. “If you’re serious about your trade, you’ve got to take care of yourself. You’ve got those flimsy Latin dresses on, you know you’re flashing your panties, you have to be in a good shape. But it comes at a price.”Ballas doesn’t lack confidence in her abilities as a judge and a teacher – she says it is her “safe place, because I know my job inside and out. All my confidence I have is in my trade, and I think my own personal issues are my own personal issues, from different marriages and from different things throughout my life.”Later this month, Ballas will have her breast implants removed, having become worried that they make mammogram screening more difficult. Her mother and aunt were both recently diagnosed with cancer, although not breast cancer. She had them in the first place, she says, because of a lack of confidence. “If I could go back to my younger self, I would say: ‘You’re fine as you are, and God makes people in different ways we’re all different shapes and sizes.’ But I think when you have people telling you different things about yourself, it’s like: chip, chip, chip, and you don’t believe anything you’ve got is nice or pretty. I think I got implants more because I was searching to find something that was beautiful, when perhaps I didn’t realise, as Danny says, it’s inner beauty that counts the most.”What is impressive about Ballas, what counts the most, is what a grafter she seems to be – that and the way she has given her knowledge and support to countless proteges. At almost 60, with five decades in the business, she should be revered in the dance world. Largely, she is, but she describes an industry rife with bullying and vitriol, at least at the top. Although she is adamant she has no knowledge of anything that could fuel a #MeToo movement within the industry, she says it is a male-dominated world. “If you’re doing well as a female and somebody feels threatened, then they make it difficult for you.” One of the reasons she jumped at the Strictly job was “because there were men at the top that were trying to push my nose out”. She says she has been prevented from judging competitions, while couples she has trained have been told they would never win competitions if they stayed with her. How has she coped? “You have to have a steel spine, darling: you won’t last five minutes in this kind of industry if you don’t. And I’m sure that’s the same for any woman in any industry, at the top.”Recently, one of the dancers she trained became a pro on Dancing With the Stars (the US version of Strictly) and he sent her a video of himself. “I was crying, I was so moved,” she says. “It was his dream, and to see that boy live his dreams is … it just touches me.” She likes to see people do well, she says. “I haven’t got a green bone in my body. I have not got a jealous streak of any type at all.” But she must be competitive? She smiles. “Well, that’s different,” she says. “I’m competitive with myself all the time – everything from the way I look to how I do on TV. I’m competitive with myself because I want to be all that I can be.”Strictly Come Dancing is on Saturday nights on BBC OneIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

With US diplomats placing renewed focus on the energy-rich eastern Mediterranean – an area they readily admit has been vastly overlooked, allowing “malign actors” to compete for power – Greece, geopolitically, has attained a new status as a key partner on Europe’s strategic southern flank.“We are opening a new chapter in our history,” prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Pompeo. “Our relationship has truly never been as strong as today.”No US secretary of state has spent as much time in Greece in years.The trip partly reflects the cooling in ties with Ankara under the unpredictable stewardship of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Talk of the US removing military installations from Turkey has been muted. Greek-US relations have warmed as tensions have risen in the eastern Mediterranean between Cyprus and Turkey over offshore gas rights.But in substance, as much as feel, analysts say Pompeo’s tour also highlights the choice the Orthodox nation has made to align its interests with Washington at a time when Greece, Cyprus and Israel have also formed a tripartite energy alliance, to the delight of the Trump White House.“The time when many Greeks wanted to minimise the US military footprint in their country is well and truly over,” said international relations professor Aristotle Tziampiris at the University of Piraeus. “What we are witnessing is a dramatic improvement in ties especially on the military, energy and political fronts. For Greek standards this is happening at the speed of light.”In a society where anti-Americanism has never been far from the surface, it is a choice that has been all the more extraordinary for its cross-party embrace.Mitsotakis’ centre right government is to a great degree building on the legacy of his leftist predecessor Alexis Tsipras. In office until July, Tsipras actively sought to promote bilateral links despite opposition from cadres who had not forgotten US support of authoritarian governments following the country’s bloody 1946-49 civil war and Washington’s backing of the ruthless military regime that ruled between 1967-74.Indicative of that sentiment, diehard leftists protested in Athens Saturday deploring a defense accord that will see US bases expand across Greece and vigorously chanting “Americans, Murderers of the People.”Technical teams fly in this week to put the final touches to the open-ended military agreement, one that will allow the US to further expand a deep-water naval base used by the Sixth Fleet on Crete, create facilities for helicopter pilots and bases for drones. As part of the pact, Greek armed forces hit by steep budget cuts during the country’s long-running debt crisis, will also benefit.Before arriving in Athens on Friday, Pompeo visited the Balkan states of Montenegro and North Macedonia. Moscow’s meddling in the area – one it has long viewed as falling within its own orbit – assumed brazen overtones last year when it tried to thwart resolution of the decades-long name dispute between Skopje and Athens in a bid to stop Macedonia joining Nato.Despite once warm relations with the Kremlin, the Tsipras government pushed through the deal. Under the new military accord, the US will invest heavily in setting up a new naval and air force base in Alexandroupolis, which is also emerging as a regional energy centre with plans to supply US liquid natural gas to southeastern Europe via the emerging regional pipeline network. Russia had also expressed interest in developing the Aegean port.“Alexandropoulis symbolises the new Greek- American commercial and military relationship,” said professor Tziampiris. “Tens years ago none of this would have been feasible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef90673c07680845e5d65a22770fbacd6cc55ce5/0_95_5319_3191/master/5319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd48ed3e0e34dbd7487a70b5ef4c5386","title":"socialists on course for victory but no majority in portugal election","story":"António Costa bucks the trend of declining fortunes for Europe’s left, but remains short of an outright majority Portuguese prime minister António Costa’s Socialist party has won the country’s general election but has fallen short of an outright majority, according to exit polls.The Socialists’ share of the vote was more than in the previous election in 2015 and bucked a wider European trend of declining centre-left fortunes.The results mean that the PS, which has governed for the past four years with the support of two smaller hard-left parties, will have 106 seats in the 230-seat parliament, up from 86 seats in the outgoing assembly and just 10 seats short of an outright majority. Four seats are yet to be attributed according to the results of votes cast abroad.Negotiations to form a government will start on Monday and could last days or weeks depending on the final result. In 2015, Costa – who had finished second behind the PSD – took less than two months to seal an unexpected alliance with the Left Bloc and Communists known as the geringonça, or improvised solution.Four years later, however, the hard-left is pushing for increases in public spending and has accused Costa of veering to the right. The prime minister has already ruled out a formal coalition, but may try to renew his governing pact with one or both parties.He may also have another potential governing partner in the upstart People-Animals-Nature party (PAN), which was on course to capture two to six seats, up from just one when it first entered parliament in the last election. The party has said it is ready to support Costa if he commits to its environmentalist proposals.Costa, 58, has reversed some of the more unpopular austerity measures, including cuts to public sector wages and pensions, introduced by the previous PSD-led government in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis, while still managing to bring the country’s budget deficit down to nearly zero.He has won praise both at home and in Brussels for combining fiscal discipline with successful measures to stimulate the economy, which is now growing faster than the EU average, helped by rising exports and a booming tourism industry that saw more tourists visit Portugal last year than it has inhabitants.The PSD, still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, was unable to profit enough from a series of recent scandals to hit the Socialists, ranging from a nepotism row to the alleged involvement of a former minister in an army cover-up of the theft of weapons from a military base.“The most probable outcome is a Socialist party minority government with support from radical left parties or, less likely, the small environmentalist party PAN,” said Federico Santi, an analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e23457211620dbaf1617f7dbc558131da78fc1f/0_335_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce293cde09c435be818804b37f61399b","title":"turkey us diplomat twitter like","story":"US embassy’s account ‘liked’ tweet about nationalist politician who was recently illThe Turkish foreign ministry says it has summoned the US chargé d’affaires after the embassy’s Twitter account “liked” a tweet about a nationalist politician who was recently in hospital.“Today the US chargé d’affaires was summoned to the ministry to give an open and clear explanation of the social media posting,” the ministry said on Sunday.It added that the US ambassador was not in Ankara.The embassy’s official Twitter account liked a tweet on Saturday in which an inidual said Turkey should be ready for a political period without Devlet Bahçeli.Bahçeli leads the Nationalist Movement party (MHP), the junior partner of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) since their formal alliance in 2018. The MHP also backed the AKP in a 2017 referendum on changing the Turkish constitution to transform the country’s system into an executive presidency.Last month Bahçeli, 71, was taken to hospital after suffering from nausea but was released shortly afterwards.

Diocesan examinersIn addition, the majority of these non-designated schools reported that the local diocesan examiners visited the school to meet the principal or religion teachers or both. Many reported that the diocesan examiners looked for evidence of the amount of religion classes per week that were on the timetable, while others reported that diocesan officials provided training for religious teachers,It adds that many principals expressed a concern about the lack of clarity in relation to the roles that the diocesan officials or local parish workers should play in their schools. “Many questioned the appropriateness of one religious group having more access to their schools over others. There was a strong demand for these roles to be clarified at both local and national level,” the review notes.Core valuesIn a statement, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) confirmed that it is aiming to develop a “patron’s framework” that will clearly articulate the core values of the ETB school sector and what is meant by them. It said the draft core values report seen by The  was a “ very early draft” of a report based on its core values review process, which has involved consultations with principals and deputy principals of all ETB schools. It says a revised version of this document will be used as a consultation document with the sector throughout the year ahead. Nessa White, ETBI’s general secretary, said clarity over the multidenominational status of the ETB community national school model may have a large influence in developing a wider approach for the sector.In these primary schools, she said, all faith formation has been moved outside the school day and all children receive the same “multibelief and values education curriculum”.She acknowledged, however, the difficulties the sector faced in defining what is meant by “multidenominational” in ETB schools with legal agreements with religious patrons.Ms White said her organisation will continue to lead its core values review process over the coming months and hopes to develop a framework by June 2020."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4041963.1570386030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"many state run secondary schools obliged to employ chaplains","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThousands of pupils attend 270 secondary schools run by State-owned Education and Training Boards. Photograph: Eric LukeThe Many State-run multidenominational secondary schools are legally obliged to employ Catholic chaplains, provide religious instruction and submit themselves to inspections by diocesan examiners, according to an unpublished report.Tens of thousands of pupils attend 270 secondary schools run by State-owned Education and Training Boards (ETB). These former vocational schools are categorised as multidenominational by the Department of Education.However, legally binding agreements with the Catholic Church dating back to the 1970s oblige a quarter of these schools to maintain a Catholic ethos and provide students with two hours of religious instruction. A draft internal report produced by Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) questions whether these schools can be truly described as “multidenominational”.In addition, it says many State-run secondary schools without these legal agreements also identify as having a Catholic or Christian ethos and are being inspected on a regular basis by diocesan examiners.These schools, for example, still have graduation Masses, symbols from the Catholic faith only and facilitate visits from Catholic religious representatives.The ETBI’s “core values and characteristic spirit review” report highlights the challenge facing the sector in becoming more representative of the wider community.The report says that, overall, ETB schools are inclusive and are open to all pupils regardless of their background.But it notes that the sector has yet to clearly articulate its core values and ethos and this has resulted in schools being left “to form their own schools-specific values and traditions”.It says that in some cases there is a confusion over whether ETB schools “are de jure ‘multidenominational’ but de facto Catholic”.An additional barrier to ETBs promoting these schools as multidenominational, it says, is that many are called after Catholic saints.Core valuesIt notes that most “designated schools” came about through the amalgamation of a number of vocational and church-run schools in an area. The agreements drawn up over governance and ethos were negotiated at a time when the ETB sector did not have clearly defined core values or a coherent position on the place of religion in their schools.It says this led to these agreements being “more influenced by the other trustee partners in relation to these matters”. “As a result, there is a question as to whether these schools can be described as ‘multidenominational’ ” the report states.Nessa White, the general secretary of the Education and Training Boards Ireland, said the report highlights the challenge facing the sector in terms of achieving consistency over the place of religions and beliefs in State schools. “We will continue to lead the core values review process over the coming months and hopes to develop the framework by June 2020,” she said.“Schools will then be required over time to redevelop their vision and mission statements and related practices to ensure that while they meet the broad needs of the school community that they are in line with the core values of the sector.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4041891.1570378502!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"twitter and hse join forces to combat vaccine misinformation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris has challenged social media companies to take action to counter misinformation online about vaccines.

The prompt will appear at the top of the person’s Twitter search results.The tool mirrors similar changes made in the US earlier this year, where people seeking information about vaccines are directed towards the US Department of Health \u0026amp Human Services and its vaccine-specific website.It also follows the template used for suicide-related searches, in which a message about the Samaritans is given prominence for Irish searches.Social media companies worldwide are coming under increasing pressure to tackle “fake news” and hate speech on their platforms.Minister for Health Simon Harris has challenged the sector to take action to counter misinformation online about vaccines, which is regarded as a significant factor in reducing immunisation uptake rates in recent years.The social media companies have to decide “which side they are on” in the vaccine debate and should consider closing accounts and web pages that spread false information, the Minister said last month at the launch of an alliance aiming to boost uptake of childhood vaccines.Responding at the time, Facebook said it and Instagram had an action plan to combat vaccine misinformation. When this is identified, rankings are reduced and links removed from search pages. Hashtags with verifiably false information are also being blocked.November meetingA meeting between the Minister and the social media companies is scheduled for next month.Karen White, Twitter’s director of public policy in Europe, said the company’s “main priority” was to “protect the health of the public conversation on the platform. Ensuring iniduals can find information from authoritative sources like the HSE is a key part of that mission”.“We understand the importance of vaccines in preventing illness and disease, and recognise the role that Twitter plays in disseminating important public health information. This collaboration with the HSE will ensure people who seek information about vaccinations on Twitter can easily access reliable and credible information.”Due in part to a decline in vaccination rates in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, measles and mumps cases have increased this year. So far, 1,765 cases of mumps have been reported and over 50 cases of measles.The HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre says the mumps outbreak that started last year is continuing and the number of cases was increasing after schools and colleges reopened."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Budget move to ensure couples who can \u0026lsquowell afford to buy\u0026rsquo will not be unfairly subsidisedGovernment \u0026lsquocommitted to the continued provision of higher education in Kerry \u0026rsquoFiona Ryan and Jonathan Mathis urge people to sign online petition for hate-crime lawNeither Government nor UCD expected to have official representation in RomeNumerous State schools being inspected by diocesan examiners, report indicatesData could inform prevention of hate crime, says Immigrant Council of IrelandLead case taken by Aoife Bennett against HSE, HPRA, Glaxosmithkline and MinisterChurch officials seeking information on number of religion classes taught in schoolsPeople searching certain keywords on Twitter will be prompted to visit a HSE pageThree people tell The  about their experiences of attacks on Irish streetsOutcome of whiplash treatment differs in less litigious cultures, say doctorsSafefood survey finds slight increase in number of energy drinks for saleCabinet to hear proposals for 30c rise to set minimum wage for adults at \u0026euro10.10 per hourMinister says development also needs to shift from \u0026lsquogreenfield\u0026rsquo suburban sites to the reuse of urban land in towns and citiesUp to 60,000 parents could benefit from new leave paid at same rate as current benefitProperties suitable for four household \u0026lsquotypes\u0026rsquo examined in new Simon Communities reportIncident involving light aircraft occurred at Duncormick in an open field"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe introduction of a proposed increase in the national minimum wage could be deferred for a couple of months until March of next year in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty will this week bring proposals to the Cabinet which would see the national minimum wage for adults increase by 30 cent to €10.10 per hour. Increases in the national minimum wage in recent years have generally been approved by the Government in the autumn on foot of recommendations from the Low Pay Commission and come into effect at the start of January.However it is understood that as part of the proposals being considered by Cabinet this week, the increase in the national minimum wage may be deferred until March if there is a no-deal Brexit.Government sources said this would be aimed at providing a “breathing space” for employers who would have to deal with the fallout from a no-deal Brexit.The current national minimum wage stands at €9.80 per hour for adult workers.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the biennial conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) in July that the national minimum wage was likely to exceed what he described as the “psychological barrier” of €10 per hour next year.EndorsedA 30 cent rise in the national minimum wage would be slightly more than the 25 cent increase which was recommended by the Low Pay Commission last year and subsequently endorsed by the Government.The commission was established by the Fine GaelLabour coalition in 2015 to advise ministers on the appropriate rate for the national minimum wage.It comprises an independent chairman appointed by the Government as well as representatives of unions, employers and campaign groups who came through a public appointment process.Increases in the national minimum wage over recent years have generally been welcomed by trade unions, but employers’ representatives have tended to be more critical.AcceptableThe national minimum wage is different to the living wage, which is the amount which social campaigners argue is the level of earnings required to provide an acceptable standard of living.Earlier this year, a report produced by the Living Wage Technical Group deemed the living wage in Ireland to be €12.30 per hour.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil in July that the national minimum wage in Ireland was now the second highest in the European Union, adding that the country was “far” from being behind the curve."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038809.1570095216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk applications for irish passports in 2019 already exceed last year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tApplications for Irish passports have been steadily increasing since 2016. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe number of applications for Irish passports from Britain and Northern Ireland in the first eight months of the year has already exceeded the total received in 2018.New figures released to Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins show that there have been 85,517 applications to the end of August this year, compared to a total of 79,513 in 2018. The increase has been driven by a surge in applications from Northern Ireland, with almost 9,000 more applications received at the end of August.Applications have been steadily increasing since 2016, when the UK voted to leave the European Union. In 2015, there were just under 26,000 applications, less than a third of the total received so far this year.Mr Collins said the figures “are a clear indication that people across the UK and Northern Ireland have realised how serious the impact of Brexit will be.”“The Irish passport has always been held in high esteem, and it’s becoming obvious that Brexit has compounded the demand as people living in the UK and Northern Ireland become increasingly worried about what impact Brexit will have on their daily lives and their ability to travel. I expect these figures will continue to increase over the next few months as uncertainty over a potential no-deal Brexit prevails,” he said.Entitlement to an Irish passport is governed by Irish law, particularly the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4041955.1570384606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk brexit proposals unworkable and unenforceable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Hain says Boris Johnson is working on a ‘not me Guv’ basis. File photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe British government’s Brexit proposals are “unworkable and unenforceable”, the North’s former secretary of state, Peter Hain, has said. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster’s Sunday News programme, the Labour peer compared the choice between Boris Johnson’s proposals and a no deal Brexit to “the choice between shooting yourself in the head and shooting yourself in the heart.” He said he believed the British parliament would block a no deal - “the law of the land is there can be no deal” - and there would be an extension to the Brexit deadline of October 31st. Final offerLord Hain was speaking after the UK Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, said Britain was open to some flexibility on the mechanism that would allow lawmakers in Northern Ireland to decide whether it remains in regulatory alignment with the EU. “The key issue is the principle of consent, that’s why the backstop was rejected three times, that was the concern in terms of both sides in Northern Ireland not approving of the backstop,” Mr Barclay told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday.“So the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that.”Boris Johnson made what he called the UK’s final Brexit offer to the European Union on Wednesday. It proposes replacing the backstop - the guarantee to prevent a hard Border on the island of Ireland - with a proposal for an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods.This would effectively create a customs ide between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and a regulatory ide between the island of Ireland and Great Britain. More concessionsThe proposal also gives the North’s Assembly – which has been suspended since 2017– the right to decide every four years whether it wants to continue to abide by EU rules on traded goods.Both the European Union and Ireland have said the proposals were unlikely to result in a deal without more concessions.In Northern Ireland, the plans have been backed by the DUP but rejected by the rest of the North’s main political parties, as well as by the business community. The Ulster Unionist peer, Lord Empey, hit out at the DUP and accused the party of doing a “u-turn” regarding a border in the Irish Sea. “It’s a ghastly deal,” said Lord Empey, “and I am still unable to understand how any unionist could be advocating such measures.” The DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson accused Lord Empey of “still fighting battle against the DUP which he lost fifteen years ago” and said the deal “removes the threat of the backstop and fully respects our constitutional position within the UK.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Getty The Government’s help-to-buy scheme will be modified so that “couples who can already well afford to buy” will not be unfairly subsidised, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.It is expected that an altered version of the incentive will form part of Tuesday’s budget following talks between Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Independent Alliance.All parties have agreed that the scheme, which offers tax rebates of up to €20,000 to first-time buyers purchasing a new build worth up to €500,000, should continue. It had been due to end in December.The Government has been examining lowering the cap from €500,000 to somewhere between €250,000 to €300,000. A senior source said there are still “mixed views” on the proposals but it is hoped that lowering the cap will incentivise developers to build more affordable homes in this price range.Mr Varadkar has signalled changes to the scheme, saying some couples who could already afford a deposit were benefitting.“What we’re working on are some modifications to make sure that it is actually helping young couples to buy, rather than subsidising couples who can already well afford to buy.”Some €206.4 million had been claimed by such first-time buyers by August of this year. Talks have centred on the proposed new cap as well as the funding of the scheme as it must be paid from the Government’s limited €700 million spending pot.Last-minute meetings between the Taoiseach, Ministers and the Independent Alliance continued on Sunday with the focus on carbon tax and health. In health, it is anticipated there will be extra funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund as well more money for home-help hours. Free GP care for under-eights is expected to be introduced at the start of the school year while prescription charges for over 70s are to be reduced. In social protection, there are expected to be no blanket welfare increases, as in previous budgets.The extra financial allocation to the Department of Social Protection is likely to be half of the €360 million secured last year, say sources. Minimum wageThe living-alone payment and qualified-child payment are likely to be increased as part of a series of targeted measures.On tax, there are expected to be no across-the-board cuts. Instead, small tweaks to the universal social charge are expected in order to protect against the expected rise in the minimum wage.However, it has emerged that any increase in the minimum wage could be deferred for a couple of months until March of next year in the event of a no-deal Brexit.While there is no financial room for across-the-board tax cuts, the Government is seeking to “correct anomalies” in the system.The personal tax credit for a self-employed person is €300 lower than the tax credit for PAYE workers.Meanwhile, the carbon tax is likely to be increased to between €6 and €7 a tonne. Talks were under way between the Independent Alliance and Mr Donohoe on Sunday night with members of the alliance keen to ensure there are financial supports available to poorer households who cannot afford an increase in the carbon tax.Speaking at a Fine Gael presidential dinner over the weekend, Mr Varadkar said there would also be provisions in the budget for increased demand for health, education and disability services. “It will also be a climate budget. We will use the budget to step-up climate action. We must do that in every budget from now on.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.New English parliament in federal system could ‘bolster the union’Folklore is dying out due to rise of social media, National Trust warnsNick: Operation Midland detectives cleared of wrongdoing after \u0026#39inadequate\u0026#39 probe by police watchdogHarry Dunn death: US diplomat\u0026#39s wife who left UK after fatal crash named Boris Johnson warns Emmanuel Macron: \u0026#39Don\u0026#39t be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK is staying in the EU\u0026#39Boris Johnson to seek Supreme Court ruling on no-deal BrexitEfforts to combat terrorism failing because of Government\u0026#39s definition of extremism, commissioner saysBritons\u0026#39 passion for gardening to be used by ministers to sell the UK overseas to visitors Boris Johnson considers Penny Mordaunt\u0026#39s plans to replace Royal Yacht Britannia with two £150m ships funded by aid budgetComment: Brussels\u0026#39 behaviour shows it can\u0026#39t really want a deal – otherwise why would it negotiate in such bad faith?Comment: We must defend our right to be offensive - but hateful extremism demands a brave responseJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s son brands actress Tracy Ann Oberman a \u0026#39nasty troll\u0026#39 after she mocks Labour leaderNorth Korea says talks with US are over unless Washington abandons \u0026#39hostile policy\u0026#39Helena Bonham Carter says she spoke to Princess Margaret using a psychic before playing her in The CrownStrictly Come Dancing 2019 Movie Week results live: Anneka Rice eliminated after dance-off defeat to David JamesJohn Humphrys says the BBC is too sympathetic on transgender issuesIraq\u0026#39s government pledges social reforms as death toll rises to more than 100 in six days of protestExtinction Rebellion warned protest could alienate the public Inheritance tax is \u0026#39fundamentally unfair\u0026#39, Cabinet minister says amid speculation levy could be scrappedComment: Rory Stewart is a classic Privileged Crusader: compassionate, restless and wants to run the worldLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000210163138_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"helena bonham carter says spoke princess margaret using psychic","story":"Helena Bonham Carter has claimed that she spoke to Princess Margaret via a psychic to ask if she could play her in The Crown. The response? That would be fine, the princess said, provided Bonham Carter smartened up a bit and learned how to wield a cigarette holder.The Oscar-nominated actress said the “little chat” was nothing out of the ordinary for her because she always consults a psychic when portraying the lives of the deceased.“She said, apparently, she was glad it was me,” Bonham Carter explained.“When you play someone real, you really want their blessing because you do have a responsibility.Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret | Beyond the graveI asked her, ‘Are you OK with me playing you?’ And she said, ‘You’re better than the other actress that they were thinking of.’“That made me think maybe she is here because it’s a really classic Margaret thing to say – she is really good at complimenting you and putting you down at the same time.“Then she said, ‘But you’re going to have to brush up and be more groomed and neater.’”Bonham Carter said the princess had also told her to “get the smoking right, I smoked in a good way, and remember the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking”.The actress said she had learnt that the princess used a cigarette holder because it elongated her silhouette, as she was permanently cross about being only five feet tall.Bonham Carter takes over from Vanessa Kirby for the third series of Netflix’s The Crown, which begins next month. As well as the psychic, she consulted an astrologer and a graphologist.She also met a relative of the princess, some close friends, and three former ladies-in-waiting. And she had her own memories to draw on, as the princess once dated her uncle, Lord Bonham Carter, who was in the Grenadier Guards.“Bizarrely, my uncle went out with her. He guarded Princess Margaret and Elizabeth and I think something happened then. I have photos of them together and they look dashing as a couple.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations.

The flare event ... was so powerful it had consequences on the surrounding of our galaxy. We are the witness to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.”Sagittarius A\u0026nbsptends to be a relatively stable “sleeping dragon”, researchers said.But the study suggests the\u0026nbspblack hole woke up dramatically as our ancient ancestors,\u0026nbspthe ape-like Australopithecines, were already afoot in Africa, releasing a burst known as a Seyfert flare.Study leader Professor Joss Bland-Hawthorn, of the University of Sydney, said: “The flare must have been a bit like a lighthouse beam.Nasa scientists get unprecedented view as black hole rips apart a starBlack hole behaving in a way scientists have never seen before“Imagine darkness, and then someone switches on a lighthouse beacon for a brief period of time.”His team at Australia’s ARC Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D) described it as a “titanic, expanding beam of energy”.Professor Lisa Kewley, director of ASTRO 3D, said: “This is a dramatic event that happened a few million years ago in the Milky Way’s history.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is lucky we’re not residing there.”In 1996, astronomers became aware of a strange glow radiating from the\u0026nbspMagellanic\u0026nbspStream. Scientists began to hunt for a cause and Sagittarius A\u0026nbspbecame the prime suspect.The team first described the evidence of this explosion in 2013, when they identified the black hole\u0026nbspas the cause.Their latest work, published in the Astrophysical Journal, builds upon and reinforces their previous findings.Based on a recent analysis of the data gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope, the researchers calculated the massive explosion took place 3.5 million years ago and lasted around 300,000 years.Black hole named \u0027embellished dark source of unending creation\u0027Galaxy next to us is ‘violent’ and coming to eat the Milky WayThe question of how black holes evolve, influence and interact with galaxies “is an outstanding problem in astrophysics”, the researchers added.Black holes are places where matter is compressed by gravity to a point where the normal laws of physics break down, bending and distorting space and time.By definition, they cannot be seen in the conventional sense, making them hard to study. Their presence is inferred from radiation emitted as gas and debris swirl around them.In another contrast to its sleepy persona, last month\u0026nbspresearchers discovered Sagittarius A was “growing hungrier”,\u0026nbspeating far more interstellar gas and dust than it had\u0026nbspever been seen doing before.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He had a car and he asked if he could go into my field. I said ‘yes that’s fine’.“I did not think there was anything wrong about it. I saw his car there on a number of other occasions. When he came with the coins he was on his own. He said he had found something and he gave me three coins.“I never saw the other man until a long time after. The man said he thought they found something of value and I never thought any more about it.”She said at one point she saw photos of the jewellery found but was not sure who had shown them to her.The jury also heard from Mrs Conod’s son Mark, a tenant farmer who farms Eye Court Farm, consisting of 208 acres of land belonging to Lord Cawley.He told the court Mr Powell also approached him to ask if he could use his detector at the farm, which is used for dairy and crops including maize, in May 2015.Police patrol Hadrian’s Wall to combat ‘nighthawk’ metal detectoristsMr Conod said Mr Powell dropped off some coins he said he found with his wife Amanda, and told them he had found something of value on his mother’s land.He claimed Mr Powell had sent photos of a bracelet and ring, but never showed him the items and did not disclose the 300 coins they had found.“I said ‘yes’ at the time. I described to him which fields he could go on. I saw him once in a field after that. He was just on his own with a metal detector.“A couple of weeks after, he showed me some coins he found. He left them with my wife. He was on his own when he came to the house with the bits and pieces. He sent pictures.“I only heard from him again when he said he had found something on mum’s field. He said he found a bracelet and a ring. He never showed us the items. He never told us about coins.“He said he had reported them to a museum. I presume they were in a museum. He did not produce them.The court previously heard the defendants deliberately concealed the find so they could cash in on the fortune and pocket the proceeds.The hoard was estimated to have been hidden in the ground more than 1,100 years ago and came from two separate areas of England.Mr Powell, of Newport, and Mr\u0026nbspDavies, of Pontypridd, have pleaded not guilty to theft. Along with Mr\u0026nbspRumney, of Cardiff, and Mr Wicks, of Hailsham, all four deny conspiracy to conceal criminal property.Mr Powell, Mr Davies and Mr Wicks are also charged with conspiracy to convert criminal property by selling it.The trial, which is due to last a month, continues.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They could take power as a minority government or pursue alliances with other left-of-centre parties to pass legislation – as they did in their last term with the Portuguese Communist Party and the radical Left Bloc.Antonio Costa, the Socialist leader and incumbent prime minister, said he would start talks with other parties with the aim of securing a political agreement for the next four years.“Political stability is essential for Portugal’s international credibility,” Mr Costa said in a speech.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A car drives through a flooded street in Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandProtesters hold smoke grenades as they gather in central Kiev to demand broader autonomy for separatist territories, part of a plan to end a war with Russian-backed fighters Anti-government protesters rush to an injured man during a demonstration in Baghdad, IraqFootage of a hugely rare polka dot zebra has been captured in Kenya.

Annual growth climbed from 0.2 per cent in 2014 to 2.1 per cent in 2018, and unemployment dropped by around half, to 6 per cent, over that period.The budget deficit – long a torment for Portugal as governments routinely overspent – is now close to zero under the financial stewardship of finance minister Mario Centeno, who also chairs the meetings of finance ministers from the 19 European nations that use the Euro.Mr Centeno is expected to continue in the post.No10 warns EU of \u0027historic misunderstanding\u0027 over Brexit delayThe Social Democrats are still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when they were in government. Also, party leader Rui Rio has struggled to contain disagreements between factions of his party.Portugal has not witnessed the rise of populist or far-right parties which have come to prominence elsewhere in the EU. Protests in Portugal are traditionally channelled into a low turnout – only about half the country’s eligible voters cast their ballot.The next government faces plenty of challenges, including the United Kingdom’s impending departure from the EU. The UK\u0026nbspis one of Portugal’s main export markets.While government spending is now more in line with revenues, Portugal’s government debt is equivalent to more than 120 per cent of gross domestic product – the third-highest in the EU. And the combined government, private and corporate debt is more than three times the country’s GDP, the Bank of Portugal says. If European interest rates rise, the Portuguese could find themselves in big trouble.Other challenges include climate change, as rainfall in the southern half of the country dwindles, and an ageing population that threatens the financing of the welfare system. The EU has said that at current fertility rates the number of Portuguese will decline from 10.3 million this year to 6.6 million in 2100.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Why  Because, for the EU, the aim was never to avoid a hard border in Ireland — something these proposals plainly achieve.The aim, rather, was to keep Britain in a subordinate position, still subject to EU law and trade policy.Brussels was reluctant to spell this out in so many words — at least publicly.A fly-on-the-wall documentary caught the staff of the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, cheering when Theresa May’s Cabinet accepted the backstop.“It took us two years,” said one, joyfully, “but we finally turned them into a colony”. Obviously, though, EU officials couldn’t take this line openly.So, instead of owning up that their goal was to keep Britain tied to their laws, they invented a story about avoiding border checks and making sure that violence did not come back to Irish politics.Still, there was a telling admission when the proposals first emerged earlier this week.Reporting on the Irish government’s response, RTE’s Tony Connelly tweeted: “The main argument against this approach is that all the technology in the world is of no usethe actual customs tarf makes your cross-border business unviable, especiallyyou’re in agrood.”In other words, it’s not about the border at all. It’s about maintaining privileged access to the UK market.At present, more than two thirds of all Irish beef exports come to the UK.Understandably, the last thing Dublin wants is for us to switch to cheaper and better beef from Australia, Argentina and the United States — something we would be able to do outside the EU’s trade rules.Many continental countries also want to make sure that Britain remains a captive market for their exporters.So when it became clear that the UK had come up with a way to avoid infrastructure at the Irish border, they moved the goalposts.What they now wanted was not an invisible border, they said, but common rules on both sides of it.Oddly, this applies only one way. No one regarded it as a threat to peace when, for example, the Republic of Ireland left the sterling zone and joined first the ERM and then the euro. But Britain signing its own trade deals is apparently unacceptable.To be fair to Eurocrats, the only reason they put these outrageous demands on the table was because there was a Remainer majority in both Houses of Parliament egging them on.The concept of keeping Britain in the customs union — or of an “Irish backstop” as Brussels officials cunningly called it — only appeared in late , more than a year after the referendum.Why  Because, by then, there had been a new election in the UK and there was now a pro-EU majority in the Commons.Labour and Lib Dem MPs told the EU, quite openly, that they would not let Britain leave except on terms agreed with Brussels — or “not without a deal” as they put it.The EU responded by offering deliberately unpalatable terms.It, like the opposition parties, plainly hopes that,the terms are hard enough, Britain will drop the whole idea of Brexit.As Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job , by the end, the terms are so hard that the Brits would prefer to stay in.”What, then, will happen now  My guess is that the EU will reject Britain’s offer — even though it achieves all the things Brussels had said were important.It will do so because it believes the alternative is not No Deal — an outcome for which Britain is far better prepared than are the  — but yet another postponement.When MPs voted to make No Deal impossible, they were in fact making a deal impossible, because they were taking away from the EU any incentive to agree terms.If I am right —Brussels rejects the deal, and Parliament then demands another extension — we will be back where we started.But with one critical dference. It will now be obvious to the entire country that Boris was prepared to go as far as any British leader could to find a compromise.It will be clear that neither the EU nor its fth columnists in our own Parliament have any interest in any outcome short of reversing the referendum.Boris, in other words, will be able to go into a general election having demonstrated good faith.He will have done everything possible to leave on good terms, but will have been blocked by MPs who had previously promised to respect the result.Labour and the Lib Dems will, by contrast, have to go into that campaign explaining why, despite their earlier pledges, they now want to drag everything out again.Why they want months or years more of anger and broken friendships, of business uncertainty, and of Britain being made to look ridiculous before the world. No wonder they keep running away from a new election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As we are all too aware, their triumph has been overshadowed by a decision to take legal action against The Mail on Sunday over a story that everyone but them had forgotten about and with every chance they might lose.Whoever happens to be right or wrong, I find the situation desperately sad.Meghan and her dad could end up having to face each other in court. It would be the sort of ghastly media circus Harry wants to protect her from. It should never have been allowed to get so out of hand.I believe that they need to think long and hard about what they want for their future happiness and that of their baby son. It would be a huge decision to walk away from public le and become plain Mr and Mrs Windsor, but it may be for the best.I am well aware it’s a dficult one. As new parents, they want to make the world a better place for their baby. They are in a uniquely privileged position to do an incredible amount of good.But we have Harry confessing he finds it tough to get out of bed in the morning and revealing that Meghan has been left bruised and battered by criticism in newspapers and magazines, and presumably by online trolls.So I reckon they need to do some serious soul-searching and ask themselves whether the wounding criticism outweighs the potential for making a dference.I think even Harry would agree that it would be unrealistic of them to expect the kind of North Korean fawning press enjoyed by Kim Jong-un.If they make mistakes they will be called out, and they have made some howlers.Flying on private jets while scolding the rest of us about our carbon footprint is not a good look.“Do as I say and not as I do” muddies the waters and dilutes their good intentions.I do sympathise with Meghan. It must have been upsetting to see a private letter she sent to her father appear in print.But we are told that a desperate Thomas Markle gave itto the newspaper concerned, presumably as some sort of misguided attempt to make contact with his estranged daughter.There’s no denying Thomas has been an idiot, with set-up paparazzi photos, plus interviews bemoaning he has lost touch with Meghan. Every time he opens his mouth, the gulf between them grows wider. Harry hasn’t even met his father-in-law. Even the birth of Archie didn’t heal the rt.If Harry’s mum was alive it would all have been very dferent. Canny Diana would have dazzled Thomas and welcomed him to the family. She would have protected her son and burnished the Meghan and Harry fairytale.Harry mentions his mum in the statement he made justying the decision to take legal action, and he is absolutely spot on about how she was pursued and hounded.It should be pointed out, however, that it was foreign paparazzi out to make a fast buck who pursued her on the night she died. The accident was fatal because she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and the driver of her car was drunk.Harry must realise that his wonderful Invictus Games and important work highlighting mental health would not be as le-changing or effectivethe media wasn’t there to cover the events.I understand why he is angry. He is protective of his we and finds it unbearable to see her upset.Like most people in the public eye, I have been subjected to deeply distressing and inaccurate media coverage, although nothing remotely on the scale suffered by members of the Royal Family.It’s tempting to hit back, but I’ve always thought it comes with the territory, andyou and those you care about know the truth that’s all that matters.Harry and Meghan are rich enough in their own right to live extremely comfortablythey gave up being royals.They could freely live anywhere in the world and Archie could grow up without any media scrutiny.If they don’t care about the fame and being “celebrities” then surely it’s a no-brainer.It would be a real shame as they have such a lot to offer but no one wants them to be miserable or even resentful.They’ve a whole lot of thinking to do.Since I turned  my mantra has been “a little bit of what you fancy does you good”.In the past decade I haven’t denied myself anythingand as a result have never felt healthier.All things in moderation hasn’t let me down yet and there really is nothing like a bacon roll slathered in butter with a fried egg on top. Unless it is a juicy steak washed down with a very large glass of red.As long as you aren’t ­having deep-fried lard three times a day then I say go for it – and ignore the faddy-food police.AMID the posturing, the bickering, the juvenile name-calling and the sheer ineptitude of our Parliament, there was one shining moment of clarity and authenticity this week.It came in the shape of Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who bravely stood up in the House of Commons and spoke about her own experience during a debate on the domestic abuse bill.It was honest, deeply moving and extremely important.Rosie is an admirable, decent person who articulated not only her own experiences, but also those who have no voice and who might not have bruises but are bleeding inside.She spoke about how abusers seek power and how they control their victims.It left fellow MPs in tears and reminded all of them that there is a hell of a lot more to do than just resolving bloody Brexit.Rosie is the sort of MP we deserve, andthis bill doesn’t go through it will be a national disgrace.I only wish there were more politicians like her.I HAVE been banging on about how deliciously seductive Sky Atlantic’s Succession is since it first burst on to our screens last year, and it looks like everyone  is now catching up.Our own Brian Cox is superb as Logan Roy, the ruthless billionaire who refuses to name the heir to his multinational business.Everyone is hideous, devious, ghastly and selfish, and the whole thing is compulsively addictive, right from the jarring theme tune to the end-of-episode clfhanger.It’s a bit like a really twisted King Lear, and Cox has never been better.This week the whole episode was dedicated to my adopted city of Dundee and the clan descended there from their NY base to “honour” Logan Roy.I was beyond excited to see Dundee University, the Discovery ship and the newly opened VA featured in this glossy, snarky American drama.Only one bum note.Logan’s hideous son Roman tries to wriggle into his father’s good books by buying him a Scottish football team.He merely incurs his wrath by purchasing deadly rivals Hearts instead of Hibs. It would have been far more effectivethe little weasel had bought my beloved Dundee United instead of Hearts.In real le, Cox is a massive Dundee fan and that would have been a wonderful nod to art imitating real le.BIG congrats to Westle’s Mark Feehily and his fiancé Cailean O’Neill, who welcomed their baby girl into the world this week.Mark was always the quiet one in the band, partly because he wasn’t able to talk about being gay when Westle were packaged as heart-throbs for teenage girls.That was back in the late Nineties and how silly it all seems now. Thankfully we have come a long way since then.Mark and Cailean have described themselves as “the happiest dads in the world”.I’m delighted Mark found his soulmate and that they’ve started a family together. I wish them all the very best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only six balls remain to be played with Britain’s star batsman standing at the crease — Boris Johnson.England’s World Cup triumph was achieved against the odds and so the passage of our nation towards Brexit has been a slog.However, the PM, unflappable and unflinching in the face of sledging from all sides, has been transformative in reshaping our fortunes.Now he stands before us with something the doubters, despoilers and delayers thought he could never achieve — a workable proposal that both delivers on the referendum and takes into account the legitimate concerns on the Irish border.Under Boris’s deal the UK would leave the EU’s customs union and the single market.It would restore the supremacy of British law over EU law and free the country from the intrusion of the meddling European Court of Justice.It would allow free trade deals to be agreed with friends and partners across the world, reinvigorating global relationships with allies old and new.It would end the payment of vast sums of hard-earned taxpayers’ money and deliver the Brexit that the British people were promised.MPs across Parliament are already starting to show that they are prepared to put partisan dferences to one side to unite behind the deal.Now it is time for the rest of the EU to do the same, to put an end to the toing and froing, the talks and the emergency summits, the snail filled — and snail-paced — diplomatic dinners and take the path out of this cul-de-sac which has now been cleared for them by Boris Johnson.Brexit was always a means to an end, not an end in itself.

They still object to anything that leads to checks on the island of Ireland, as the UK scheme would do.No say there is the “potential for some meetings next week”. There is, though, little optimism about what will come from them.Even the biggest optimists in Downing Street think there is only a one in four chance of getting a deal, and these odds are ening by the hour.There is doubt that the process will even make it into the “tunnel”, the EU’s term for intensive serious negotiations.One No source tells me: “We’re not going to get into the tunnel without more compromise but we’re getting to the limit of what we can do.”There are TWO ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS. Firstly, Theresa May gave away so much with the original backstop.The Irish and the EU, understandably, object to the UK giving up on commitments it made in both the Joint Report of December  and the Withdrawal Agreement.But this means the perfectly reasonable proposition that the UK should be able to leave the EU with its customs territory INTACT is seen as unreasonable.It should be noted that at Cabinet on Thursday several ministers, notably Theresa Villiers and Andrea Leadsom, expressed concern at just how much the Government was conceding in this offer.Secondly the EU know thatno agreement can be reached, that doesn’t mean the UK leaves without a deal on October , but there is an extension. Why  Because the Benn Act saysthere is No Deal, the UK Government must ask the EU for an extension of its membership.This takes the pressure off Dublin. It means they know the choice now isn’t between Boris’ offer and No Deal, but between this offer and an extension.This creates an almost irresistible temptation to take the extension and seea general election changes things.After all,you think — as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar does — that the UK would vote to Remain in a second referendum, why not take your chances with that I understand thatthe UK and the EU were close to an agreement, the Government would be prepared to hold a vote in Parliament to reassure Brussels its plan could pass. But with little sign of a deal, it doesn’t see the point.If Boris is to get the EU to take his Brexit offer seriously, he will have to win an election. A majority in Parliament would show both that he could pass a deal and that the UK would leave without a dealone could not be reached.In these circumstances, he would have a real shot at getting the EU to engage seriously with him.But, as Michael Gove fretted at Cabinet this week, there is a danger that the Irish government ends up rejecting pragmatic solutions as it finds it politically easier to accept No Deal and blame the Brits.Brexit isn’t going to be over by the end of this month. There is going to have to be a general election before this deadlock can be broken.THE mystery of what the Government intends to do about the Benn Act is deepening.In a submission to a Scottish Court this week, No said it would send a letterthere is no deal by October   and that it wouldn’t try to subvert the act.Yet at Cabinet this week, Boris Johnson told Esther McVey that the Government had four or five extremely good plans for dealing with the Benn Act. When challenged by another minister, Boris  said that “some of them are cunning plans”.But what could they be Well, the submission to the court appears to rule out saying that another piece of law trumps the Benn Act.  One senior Downing Street source tells me thatthe Government has to send the letter, then the EU will have to send for its lawyers to understand it.My information is that Downing Street thinks that the fact that the European Council and Commission deal with governments – not parliaments – gives it some flexibility both before and after the letter is sent.For instance, the letter that the Benn Act requires the PM to send doesn’t set out any reason for the extension and the EU has always said it would want to know what the purpose of any delay was.It also does not say that the UK will not disrupt the EU’s own proceedings – something Theresa May committed to, to get her two extensions.But it is still hard to imagine that the EU would refuse to grant an extensionthe letter was sent.No Deal would be disastrous for Ireland and it is hard to imagine the EU going for that option rather than an extension.Stewart, who has quit the Tories to run as an independent, has a mountain to climb to defeat the Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan next May.But with the campaign of the Tory candidate Shaun Bailey a cause of despair for senior Tories, Stewart has a chance to seize second place.A good campaign and a strong second place would get Stewart noticed.It would put him in a stronger position to either set up a new type of party, something he is very keen to do, or to negotiate histo the ToriesBrexit is done by then.THE Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has written to Cabinet colleagues asking for agreement to offer more than £million of public backing to Ataer Holdingsit takes over British Steel.If British Steel can be saved it would preserve several thousand jobs.But there will be worries that this proposal will open the Government up to demands that they help out other struggling firms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was wrapped in a cooling mat for  hours as part of treatment known as therapeutic hypothermia, which helps limit the extent of any brain injury.Fortunately, Jac appears to have recovered and is now at home - eleven weeks on from his -day hospital ordeal, the Daily Post reports.   It is not yet known whether he has suffered any permanent damage as a result of the episode, but so far, tests and milestone checks have been positive and he hasnapost had a seizure since.His parents, from Bangor, Wales, say they are indebted to medical staff for everything they did for their son and want to repay them by raising money for a cooling mat for Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital in Bangor.The pair want to buy a mat for the hospital, which currently has none, so that babies starved of oxygen at birth can begin the treatment while they are being transferred to special care. Ms OaposSullivan said: Jac was born at Ysbyty Gwynedd a day early on July  after a brilliant text book pregnancy with no problems. But after a dficult labour, to our complete shock he was not breathing when he was born and was immediately taken to the special care baby unit at Glan Clwyd. Within hours he began to have seizures that continued for four days, in total Jac had around . What we now know is the seizures were a symptom of HIEa condition caused by a lack of blood and oxygen reaching a babyaposs brain, in Jacaposs case during his birth.    It can affect all of a babyaposs organs, particularly the brain where a lack of oxygen can lead to brain injury causing physical disability and learning dficulties. There is no cure for HIE, however in more severe cases, therapeutic hypothermia can reduce the extent of damage causedgiven shortly after the oxygen depriving incident. It involves the baby being placed in a cooling mat for  hours. The mat lowers the body temperature to ., placing the baby in a controlled hypothermic state and as a result limits the extent of brain injury caused by HIE.The -year-old added: Jac was transferred to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd at  hours old to receive this treatment as currently there is no such equipment available in Ysbyty Gwynedd.   What happened to Jac was unusual but could happen to any baby. We have been very lucky, Jac is a healthy and happy boy and is not showing signs of any damage. Only time willany permanent damage was done, but what we do know is that without the treatment it is highly likely any damage would be signicantly worse. The family have now set up a crowdfunding page to help other babies born in similar situations.

And you may be surprised to learn that both light switches and TV remote controls are amongst the filthiest surfaces in the average household.

He has teamed up with online blind store  Blinds, which found in a recent survey that % of people in the UK feel anxious when their house is untidy, reports Hull Live. When to clean your… Toilet: Once a week  The ceramic surface makes them really easy to clean so scrubbing your toilet once a week with bleach or disinfectant in the bowl is enough to keep good hygiene levels. Just be sure to put the lid down before you flush - to avoid contaminating the entire bathroom. Kitchen surfaces: Every time you use them Cleaning your kitchen surface as you go will help to reduce a huge workload in the long run. Spray with disinfectant to kill any nasty bacteria, both before and after preparing a meal.  Carpet:  to  times a week  Everyone loves the warmth and comfort of a carpet, but you must remember that they harbour a lot of bacteria. Not only that - they are often home to other nasties such as dust mites which can cause asthma. Vacuum regularly and to take off your outdoor shoes before walking on your carpet. Bedding: Once a week  Paul recommends that you wash your bedding above  degrees to kill any bacteria. Unless you sweat a lot at night or enjoy sleeping in the nude, once a week at  degrees is appropriate - and isn’t too time-consuming. To lessen the need to change your sheets as often, a mattress protector is advised. Sinks: Daily when used Again, a quick clean of your ceramic sink is a good way to chip away at chores throughout the week. The plug area can be an unseen danger and hotspot for bacteria and dirt: one that can be easily combated with permanent antimicrobial protection.

Denise Ohnona, who dreamed of gracing the catwalk when she was a teenager, thought her chance had been snatched from her when the car she was travelling in was hit by a bus. Now, aged , she is finally living her dream. And Denise has relived the horrying moment she awoke to see the damage caused to her face by the collision.She told the Liverpool Echo : When I first looked in the mirror at my reflection in the hospital and saw my face I screamed. I started to cry as soon as I saw it.    Up to that point she had been working as a retail assistant. She then received a call from a modelling agency offering her work - and the new opportunity meant she was able to sign to the firm and start a new career. However on October , , just days after the phone call, Denise found her dreams being crushed when she was involved in a horric road accident. She said: Iaposd been in Liverpool during the day, but I decided to stay over which is something I never normally would do. My boyfriend at the time picked me up and the city was just like a ghost town, it felt like something was going to happen. We’d been in the car for about  seconds and then a double-decker bus crashed into us.    In the impact of the collision, Denise was forced across the passenger seating, hitting the steering wheel. She said: My head was pouring with blood, I was screaming. It was completely split in every way - my cheek was pretty much hanging off. Tragically, the road accident left Denise with permanent facial scars. Heartbroken by what had happened, she found herself becoming a recluse. She said: After the accident, I wasnapost going out at all. I’d changed, I wasnapost the person I used to be. I was put on anti-depressants. When I ed to my job at Next, I went to work in the office in the back - I couldn’t face people. I wouldn’t even go to the supermarket on my own, I needed someone to hold my hand. I never wanted to be in the limelight, my scars couldn’t even be covered up with makeup as I suffer from hypertrophic scarring.  Over the next  years, Denise would start the slow progression back to normality. She said: I moved back home and joined the gym and started weightlting. The biggest thing for me was quitting sugar. Denise also became a mother to two girls. She added: People were still interested in me to do jobs as a model. My boyfriend would say to me that I should start it again, but I didnapost want to with the scars on my face. It would only be in January this year that Denise, now -years-old, would reignite her teenage dreams.

Thomas Markle yesterday told why he felt forced to release details of a private letter sent to him by his daughter Meghan which is now at the centre of a bitter UK legal battle. Sources close to him say he is ready to travel to the UK to defend his actions. An insider said: “It is tragic how Tom didn’t come to Meghan’s wedding yet his first brush with anything royal could be in one of Her Majesty’s courts. “Tom speaking out to defend his actions [over the letter] shows his intent, he is adamant he was justied.” The potential court case is yet another twist in the bitter estrangement between Meghan and her father. The retired Hollywood lighting director, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, failed to walk the Duchess, , down the aisle at Windsor Castle in May last year after having a heart attack.  Thomas, , was hospitalised days after he was exposed for faking pictures with the paparazzi. The pair have not seen each other since . He has never met his son-in-law Harry or grandson, Archie. The Duchess is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing the highly personal note. Her solicitors filed papers last week claiming to publish the letter was a breach of , infringed her privacy and was a breach of the Data Protection Act. Meghan could be called by the paper to be cross-examined while her father appears as a witness for the defence. She is facing claims she invaded her own privacy after her US friends provided details of the letter’s contents to an American celeb magazine. Pals of the royal spoke to a journalist from People after Meghan had reportedly sanctioned the move. She could now be forced to swear on oath whether she did.

The retired lighting director said he wanted to defend himself after the letter was first mentioned publicly in the American magazine. He said: I decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghanaposs friends in People magazine. I have to defend myself.    I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didnapost seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.

Mr Markle said: I donapost want a picture for any other reason thanwe show harmony then the press will back off.    When I opened the letter I was hoping it was the olive branch Iaposd longed for.

This week, Meghan began legal proceedings against the newspaper, claiming it had breached , infringed her privacy and breached the Data Protection Act by publishing the note. The claim also alleges the paper edited the letter by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specic sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum says she finds surrogacy as an aposaddictionapos and after giving birth to her own niece she wants to do it again. Jenna Newell, , from Llanelli, recently decided to give her cousin a child of their own after they struggled to naturally conceive. Jenna decided to do it while pregnant with her second child, reports Wales Online. She gave birth to her daughter and less than six months later she was pregnant with her cousinaposs child. There are two types of surrogacy traditional and gestational. Traditional is where the surrogateaposs own eggs are used, and gestational is where a sperm and egg from others are used, sometimes from the Intended Parents . Initially, Jenna was hoping to go down the gestational surrogacy route.    Jenna said: I signed up to  surrogacy UK , and it was after I had revealed this to my family that my cousin came forward and told me they were having trouble conceiving. I had no idea. At first we were looking into getting an egg donated, but when we realised how much more medical intervention was involved, we decided to go for a traditional surrogacy. It worked out as my cousin would then have a biological link to the baby. Traditional surrogacy can be initiated at home with an insemination method, but Jenna and the Intended Parents opted to go to a clinic. The fact it was my egg didnapost change my feelings about the surrogacy. We were done having our children after our two and I was considering egg donation anyway. Jennaaposs family were initially sceptical about the idea of surrogacy. She added: My husband always knew from when we met that I wanted to be a surrogate, but he never thought it would happen. When we found out my cousin wanted a baby, but was struggling, he said I just had to do it. He was always worried that I would be a surrogate for a couple and then they would just leave with the baby, and I would have no contact or relationship, but this way we knew I wouldnapost feel used.  My parents were initially a bit worried about the idea, but as soon as they realised it was for someone they knew they were really happy about it. Before Jenna knew of her cousinaposs fertility issues she had been in talks with a couple who lived a seven-hour drive away. She said: It didnapost work out as I was worried they would have missed the birth as they were so far away, and also you have to build up that trust to know you would get updates or stay in touch. Iaposm not there to be a parent at all, but Iaposve heard stories of surrogates who have never heard from the family again and have felt used. During the surrogacy process Jenna ran a blog called Then There Were Three and signed up to exclusively surrogate Facebook groups to try to build relationships with fellow women going through the same thing. Sometimes you would get someone slip through the net, Jenna said, adding two days after I gave birth to my niece I had a message askingcould be their surrogate, at that point I was like, aposerm, noapos. This wasnapost the only message like this that Jenna received. I had a message from one woman which said that she had bad morning sickness in her pregnancy and could I have her next one for her, then even someone asking how much I charge which was ridiculous. In the UK is it illegal to advertise for a surrogate and to pay them. Surrogacy is technically a gt, although any expenses for the surrogate are expected to be paid by the intended parents, so that the surrogate is not out of pocket by the process.    The expenses can include fuel and parking for attending appointments, loss of earnings, maternity clothing, pregnancy vitamins and food for cravings. Jenna said: Usually, average expenses for a surrogacy in the UK can range from £, to £,, but the only thing we needed really was for loss of earnings for my husband as he took a week off work once the baby was born for my recovery, and my cousin drove me to most appointments and bought me vitamins. I also had maternity clothes from my most recent pregnancy so that saved lots of money. Aside from the creation of a new family, there is another aspect to surrogacy, filled with legal admin. Both Jenna and her husband, along with the Intended Parents, had to adjust their wills so, for example,Jenna passed away, none of her estate would be left to the new baby. Legally in the UK, Jenna and her husband had legal rights over the baby until a Parental Order was able to go through the courts, which took  months after the birth. It was scary and annoying, Jenna recalled. I had to go and register the birth, and until the baby was six weeks old, it was myself and my husband who had to go on the birth certicate, because we are married, even though we werenapost the parents. I had to give consent to my cousin for her to register the baby at the doctors. It makes me grateful that I decided to do surrogacy with someone I already knew and trusted and vice versa, as legally the surrogate can have the final say and change their minds, as could the intended parents, leaving you with a baby you werenapost expecting, but that is very rare.    The service Jenna experienced medically, she said, was incredible. When I was  weeks pregnant my midwe asked my cousinshe intended to breastfeed, which not many people know is possible. She was referred straight away to induce lactation and was eventually able to successfully breastfeed. Even at the hospital, after I gave birth, they had to put tags on the baby to match my own name, but they also gave tags to mum that match the baby too. Itaposs something that is so lovely to keep and I know it meant a lot to her. Jenna was allowed three people in the birthing room with her her husband and the Intended Parents. The midwives allowed the IPs to make the decision of delayed cord clamping and the mother was told to remove her top so that the baby could be put straight on her skin.

An air stewardess broke up the fight, and seated one of the rowdy men at the front of the airliner in an effort to calm tensions.    Minutes later, though, the man vaulted back to his pals - where things kicked off again. Passengers then tried to break up the fight, leading to the moment one of the men apparently spat in a womanaposs eye. As a girl shrieks, a woman shouts: Thereaposs children on the airplane!

Now, I take it everywhere I go so Tanya is always with me.” Tanya, , wrote the card in July, as her le slipped away, to give Vinnie strength in the days after her death from cancer. The actor said: “She left it with her precious diaries. “Inside she had written: ‘To my love Vin, something wonderful happens to me every day. It’s being with you. You are my morning sunshine the moment I wake. All my love, Tanya.’ I broke down when I read it because I loved her like that too.”    Sobbing, Vinnie said he is counting the days until he is reunited with the love of his le. And he has bought an adjacent cemetery plot so his ashes can be buried alongside Tanya’s. Tanya endured a six-year battle after being diagnosed with melanoma in  but last year it spread to her brain. In today’s Sunday Mirror, -year-old Vinnie revealed he believes he was visited by her spirit in the hours after her death in July.  He now believes she is waiting for him in the afterle. Vinnie said: “I’m content to crash through the rest of my le in Heaven’s waiting room until Tanya calls me. The rest of my le is not a long timewe are going to be together for eternity. “But I want to live to do the right thing by our daughter, Kaley, and Tanya’s family. “But she’ll call me when the time is right.”  Vinnie and Tanya met when they were children in their hometown of Watford. He said: “I can’t rememberI fancied her straight away but she was always very striking.” But the pair never got together until after Tanya’s first marriage to footballer Steve Terry broke down. By then, issues with her health were already beginning to loom. She almost died in childbirth with Kaley, who Vinnie later adopted, and had to have an emergency heart transplant. When he asked Tanya’s dad Lou, now ,he could marry her, he warned him le would be dficult because of her health. But he was unperturbed. Vinnie recalled: “Lou asked meI knew what I was taking on because Tanya was not a well lady. But I promised him I loved her and that never changed and never will.”  Tanya never spoke about dying or her wishes for her funeral throughout her fight. Vinnie added: “I begged doctors not to tell her she was nearing the end when things got really bad. “We just couldn’t talk about her dying because I just couldn’t accept it.” But that tragic moment did arrive. Speaking of Tanya’s funeral, Vinnie said: “Hundreds packed into our local church in LA, where we had built our le, to say goodbye. Another memorial was held in the UK, she was so loved.” Tanya was cremated and her ashes buried in LA’s Forest Lawn Cemetery. Vinnie said. “There’s a tree next to her plot for Kaley to sit under. I’ve already bought the plot next to her so my ashes can be buried there too, and we can be together forever.”  Tanya died weeks after the couple’s th wedding anniversary in June, which she spent in intensive care. They had planned to mark the occasion by flying family and friends from the UK for a New Year’s Eve party in LA but Tanya didn’t make it. Vinnie said: “While Tanya was going through chemo, she’d stop treatment for a month so she could enjoy Christmas. But she always had to have something to look forward to and she wanted to celebrate our anniversary on New Year’s Eve. She booked all the flights. “We’re going ahead with the plans. It will be tough but it’s what she would have wanted.”  The festive period for Vinnie will also be tainted with sad memories. It was last Christmas Eve, the couple received a call from Tanya’s doctor, who broke the dreadful news the cancer had spread to her brain. Vinnie said: “We broke down in each other’s arms. It was the first time we really both broke down. That was when Tanya knew it could be her last Christmas. She said, ‘I want to have a fantastic Christmas, what can they do ’ The doctors gave her steroids. She was hugging friends and family and saying, ‘Every moment is precious.’ I think they maybe knew.” "},{"url":null,"title":"vinnie jones weeps relives final","story":"NewsVinnie Jones weeps as he relives final moments with we Tanya as she died at EXCLUSIVE: The actor and former footballer reveals he has cried almost every night in his first moving interview since Tanya died aged ShareCommentsByHalina Watts:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video vinnie-jones-weeps-relives-final-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news vinnie-jones-weeps-relives-final-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The hardman footballer-turned-actor told in heartbreaking detail how he gently kissed his soulmate and told her “I love you, I love you.” Tanya, in her favourite navy Ralph Lauren pyjamas, was surrounded by Vinnie and five family members, including her daughter Kaley, . Aged , she had finally succumbed after a brave and dignied six-year battle with three forms of cancer. She and Vinnie both had treatment for melanoma. While Vinnie got the all-clear, Tanya could not break free of the disease’s cruel clutches. Vinnie shed tears but was also able to smile proudly as he revealed Tanya’s courage and told of their precious final days at home in Los Angeles. And ruling out ever falling in love again, he declared: “She was the light of my le. I will never be with anyone .” Vinnie, , also revealed he had felt Tanya’s soul leave the room after she passed away. Later that night he sensed her presence in the form of a white light in the sky.    Speaking at Tanya’s childhood home near Watford , Vinnie told the Sunday Mirror: “In that last week of her le when the doctors said there were no more treatments, I never told her she was dying. We never spoke of that, I didn’t want her to know. “But she kept saying ‘take me home. Can I go home now ’ She desperately wanted to go home. So did she know  Probably. In the hospital I slept there every night and Kaley would come every morning. “She has never ever slept one night in hospital without me there. I have always been by her side. On the week of her death, the doctors said very nicely: ‘These are your options, we don’t knowit is going to be months or weeks’. “Through my grief I said: ‘I don’t want her to be in any pain’. “So we took her home. Straight away she was on the oxygen. Then she was on fentanyl. We got some beautul innocent moments in those last days. She would try and get out of the patio windows or she would wake up and look and me and go: ‘You... you know.’ Some of the moments would make you laugh. These were very special moments.”  Tanya – who had an emergency heart transplant after Kaley was born – was first diagnosed with cancer in . She was treated at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles before living out her final days in the couple’s Hollywood home. They had moved to Tinseltown after Vinnie went from footie hero to movie favourite following his breakthrough role in Guy Ritchie’s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  years ago. Vinnie told the Sunday Mirror: “She would sleep a lot, wake up, then fall asleep again. The nurses and doctors said: ‘Talk away, she is listening to you.’ “There was one moment when we were talking about her horse and she was fast asleep, then all of a sudden she put her hands up like she was riding a horse. She was stroking her pillow, asstroking the horse’s mane.”  Choked up, Vinnie’s voice cracked before he continued: “It proved to us she was listening. “Then when she started asking for morphine. We knew that was the countdown.” Over her final weeks Vinnie would sleep in a room opposite to Tanya and they would blow each other kisses. Describing the moments before she died on July , Vinnie went on: “I woke up to hear this coughing. I had read a lot of books, you don’t want to read them but you do, and I knew what that coughing meant. I flew up and went into her room. She was gasping for breath for about  minutes. We got everyone in the room, Kaley, her parents, her brother. We were all there. The nurse was giving her morphine. “We knew it was the end, we were cuddling her. I kissed her a lot and told her I loved her. I kept saying: ‘I love you, I love you.”  Speaking through his tears, Vinnie added: “It was all very peaceful, then her gasps got less and less and she went quiet. I looked at the nurse and said: ‘Has she gone ’ And that was it. “It all happened so quickly, you are not prepared for it. So we sat there for an hour with her. We were completely numb. It was as though she was still sleeping. But she was gone. “When she finally went it felt like Tinker Bell had released from her. It felt like her spirit was moving in the room. I got peace from that.” Later that night Vinnie received a sign from Tanya. “We were outside until about midnight but I was the last to go to bed,” he said. “With Tanya, she would always blow me a kiss and I would catch it and carry it with me. “I went to go in and I looked up and there was a small white light up straight above me. I thought it was strange. It was right there above the house. So I went: ‘Is that you babe ’ But the light didn’t move. “Then as I went to go in, I turned, blew her a kiss and threw it. And the light that had been there went straight over my head, then it went across my vision, then up into the sky. “That was her saying ‘we are all done, everything is good. I’m up there, I’m going to wait for you’. I never believed in any of that spiritual stuff. Never. I thought it was a load of BS. But now I believe in an afterle.”  Vinnie – who won a legion of fans as a soccer hardman with Wimbledon, Cha and Leeds – was married to Tanya for  years and adopted Kaley. Their story is one of showbusiness’s most enduring romances. They renewed their vows in  and Vinnie wore his original wedding suit. And the star, who won the FA Cup in Wimbledon’s famous  win over Liverpool , is adamant no one will ever replace Tanya in his heart. He said: “I’m a shell. She is the only one... whenever I let myself down, or her down, she was always the strongest, the person who I answered to. She wouldn’t give me her blessing to meet someone  – I just know her. I can’t see it happening, I might have friends or whatever, I would be astonishedthat happens. “I think I’ve only got a little way to go until I’m with her, in the spectrum of the universe.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman fled down street underwear","story":"NewsWoman fled down street in underwear from abusive husband who threatened to hang herSwansea woman said she could remember the moment when he threw the rope around her neck asit was yesterday, but she then “blacked out\"ShareCommentsByLiz Perkins:,  OCT NewsIn  she said she desperately tried to leave, but it was not until  that she finally did so \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, said she is still unable to get free from her sick ex as she has been unable to orce him yet. She said she has been left with PTSD after the monster raped her, spat tea at her face and hit her in the face with the bottle.Detailing the horric night he threatened to hang her, she told Wales Online : “He grabbed a rope and said ‘I will do this,’ I had the rope over my neck - I would pray he would take me away from this pain.“All I can remember is that I passed out and wet myself with it. “He then stopped what he was doing. “I am petried of this man, I thought he was going to kill me.

But it was her eventual husband that she ended up with - despite her saying there was zero attraction. Four weeks later the abuse began. She said she went to the south coast of England at the end of the February to visit them both and he was jealous. “He had a go at me after I went down to see both of them, I didn’t realise they both liked me,” she said. “Within four weeks I did not recognise that the abuse had started. When I came back I was accused of sleeping with his friend. He turned up in Swansea in April and again in May, she said.  He came down and wanted to know what was going on andI was in a relationship with his friend. I did not know how to get away. I wasn’t in a relationship with him - I didn’t want to get married.” The warning signs were there, she said, but she stayed with him, even after he once grabbed the handbrake of her car as she drove along a Swansea road at mph. “I fled from the car in tears, I thought he was going to kill me. But I refused to make a statement. Nothing was ever done.” She added: “There were times when I went to leave and he snapped my car keys.” But despite the constant abuse she said she felt forced into marrying him. “I tried to end the relationship but he said he was not leaving, I was afraid. “He gave up his job and one day told me ‘I will cause a scene in your workplace.’ “He said he wasn’t going back to England.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOn March , , an earthquake triggered a nuclear disaster in Okuma, Japan, that would change the lives of some , people forever. The most powerful ever recorded in Japan and the fourth most powerful in the world, the Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami moved Honshu, the main island of Japan .m east. It also triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster - the most severe nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster of . In the days after the accident, radiation released to the atmosphere forced the government to declare an ever larger evacuation zone around the plant - culminating in an evacuation zone with a -kilometer radius. Thousands of residents from communities surrounding the plant were forced to turn their backs on a place they called home. Now, the Daily Mirroraposs Special Correspondent Tom Parry and photographer Andy Stenning have gained rare access inside the radioactive Fukushima plant eight years after its catastrophic meltdown...    For the last eight years, only animals have wandered in the silent ghost towns near the Fukushima nuclear power site as nature reclaimed empty buildings. Family homes in which generations lived had to be rapidly abandoned in the dead of night, with treasured possessions left behind to rot. High radioactivity still lingers in hotspots around the stricken plant, but today some of the evacuated residents of the nearest place, Okuma, are finally coming back. Earlier this year the Japanese government lted the mandatory evacuation order. I recently met the elderly radiation refugees whose belatedto their mostly derelict hometown marks an end to a nightmare most believed would never end. On a previous visit to Fukushima in , I saw these same people being bussed in and out of the -mile radius evacuation zone to bring out belongings. Given only an hour to stuff as much as they could into bin bags, they looked forlorn in the government-issue face masks. Victims of an avoidable catastrophe caused by a failure to heed warnings that a tsunami could trigger a radiation fallout, they struggled to accept their exile.    Even now many feel they have been forgotten as Japan seeks to move on from Fukushima, the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. “When I left at first I thought it would be two or three days,” says -year-old Hikaru Murai, who used to own a bar in Okuma. “Firefighters came to my house and said I had to go. Only when I had left did they inform me it would actually be more like  years. “I was forced out in March , when the tsunami happened. I kept hoping everyone would come back, but that will never happen now. I am very sad to be getting older and older and not to be able to have what I had before.” Hikaru is one of dozens of Okuma residents now living in purpose-built pre-fab homes on higher ground above his old street. His original home remains in a hot zone, and he is only allowed inside it for a maximum of  days a year. Doctors have warned him that any longer would expose him to a higher risk of illnesses like thyroid cancer. It could be another five years before Okuma is fully opened. In the meantime amusement arcades, shops, restaurants, factories and car showrooms that have become sagging, overgrown wrecks are being bulldozed one by one. Most of the buildings were badly damaged by the massive earthquake which provoked the -metre high tsunami surge.    Around the town, police officers wearing masks stand at checkpoints, blocking entry to streets where Geiger counter readings are still dangerously high. Trains still stop short of Okuma, and the railway line is being engulfed by the forest which has swallowed up much of the contaminated region. Another resident, grandmother, Youko Takano, , has opened up a cafe in nearby Namie in an attempt to revive the areaaposs fortunes. “I remember the earthquake well,” she says. “Everything was moving, I couldnapost even stand. I used to work in the cafe at a dormitory for power station workers. First I was moved to the edge of town, and then we were shted even further as the radiation kept spreading. “I had to leave everything, many precious things like the traditional memorial to my parents which was like a shrine. “It was so hard being in an unknown strange place where I didnapost want to be.” Youko says she is one of fewer than , of the pre-tsunami population of , to come back.    She tells me she opened the cafe because there was “a need for somewhere to go” in the eerily empty town. “Most of my friends have still not moved back, which makes me very sad,” she adds. “Most of their homes are uninhabitable now. I was born and brought up here and I never wanted to leave.” During the evacuation of hospitals and nursing homes inside the zone,  patients and elderly people died. Once a bustling commuter town for the massive power station, Okuma is now a place of shadows. There is hope of new le though. Further up the coast, I stop at a beach which was closed off because of radiation pollution fears until earlier this year.

The religious rite dates back centuries, partly intended to allow men to have a legitimate relationship while away from their wives. Now Iraqi men and Shia clerics are now abusing it to give a veneer of legitimacy to child prostitution. One cleric in Karbala told the undercover BBC journalist girls as young as nine could be subject to the procedure.

The offer at Mkulu African Hunting Safaris comes as wildle experts warn cheap air fares and falling tour prices are making the vile pursuit affordable to far more people. The advert boasts: “Book a lion hunt with us and add a lioness at no extra cost.” Eduardo Goncalves, of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “Business is booming for the trophy industry. “Before, it was just the landed gentry and army colonels who went on hunting safaris. “Today, it’s gas engineers, utility company customer service managers, NHS suppliers, internet provider supervisors and even pensioners jetting off to kill wild animals for fun.Last-minute deals and cancellation offers mean some hunters are shopping around for bargains. It’s like Black Friday but for the animals every day is a black day. “We’re facing an extinction crisis, yet we’re allowing more and more hunters to shoot rare and endangered animals.”    The cut in the cost of hunting holidays is also down to an explosion in the number of game reserves in South Africa and neighbouring Botswana and Namibia. Another package at Rance River Reserve, South Africa, on sale via Bristol-based A Decoy has a “special offer” on a cull package. Beneath a picture of a hunter who has slaughtered a zebra, the advert reads: “ day,  animals,  hunters £,  hunters £,. “Choose  between: Black wildebeest, Bontebok, Impala , ImpalaJackal, Kudu , Warthog, Baboon, Vervet Monkey. Add a Zebra for £.” Another firm, Discount African Hunts, sells packages under the banner “making Africa affordable”.  The firm sends out a weekly ­newsletter with cut-price, last-minute cancellation places on hunts. This summer, Manish Ghelabhai ­travelled to South Africa with Pawprint Safari – which runs wildebeest and antelope hunts for £, plus flights. The gas engineer, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, is pictured on the company’s Facebook page next to a dead lion – which typically costs £,. He wrote online: “I always thought that I would struggle to afford a hunting trip to Africa.”  Mr Ghelabhai, whose other targets have included antelopes, also boasted: “The lion in my avatar was taken with the  at - yards and he went down with little resistance.” Mr Goncalves said: “Manish Ghelabhai openly boasts about being able to get just eight to nine yards from a lion before shooting it dead. Shooting a tame lion in an enclosure isn’t brave, it’s horric. Doing it just for fun and so you can boast about it is utterly shameful. “Lion hunting is now a mass-market industry and the first thing that goes out the window is welfare. Inbreeding is causing all sorts of diseases and deformities, as well as cubs being stillborn.”  The Mirror has been campaigning for a ban on the importation of animal trophies into the UK. And last week, animal welfare minister Zac Goldsmith said he will be launching an immediate consultation with a view to introducing a ban. Mr Goncalves added: “The Government’s consultation on banning trophy imports cannot come soon enough. While we’re waiting, the Government should impose an immediate moratorium on the import of hunting trophies.” Mr Ghelabhai declined to comment when we approached him, as did Pawprint, Rance River and Mkulu.

With keeper Chris Maxwell stranded at his neer post all it needed was a tap in for a goal.However no Aberdeen player was in a situation to capitalize in front of goal.In the th minute Lewis Ferguson fired in a powerful  yard drive but it was straight at keeper Maxwell who comfortably saved,Moments later Hedges shot over from the edge of the penalty area as Aberdeen began to press.Hibs went ahead in the th minute when a corner kick fell to defender Ryan PORTEOUS who took a touch then fired beyond keeper Lewis from  yards out.Aberdeen were deservedly leading. A bad day for the Dons got even worse when Main received a straight red card for a challenge on Stevie Mallan where he jumped into the challenge and appeared to catch his foot with his studs.Red was harsh on Main.Yet again captain Lewis came to the rescue when Doidge was one on one but the keeper raced off his line and brilliantly blocked his  yard shot.McGinn#s cross from the left finds Hedges who lays the ball back to Gallagher. He finds himself some space in the box but he shoots over the bar.In the th minute Hedges slid the eball to substitute Jon Gallagher who turned quickly in the box to open up space but blasted over from  yards.Hibs should have doubled their advantage in the th minute when Doidge, who had looked offsside when collecting the ball, was played one on one with Lewis.Instead of squaring to the onrushing Scott Allan for what would surely have been a goal he opted to shoot and Lewis raced off his line to make another vital save.Moments later Hedges fired in a vicious  yard drive that cracked off the near post.A man down Aberdeen equalized in the th minute when COSGROVE raced onto a corner from Niall McGinn to bullet in a header from  yards.Deep into injury time Aberdeen were reduced to  men when Ferguson was red carded for a challenge on Mallan.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Leigh, Considine, McKenna, Ferguson, Campbell, E.

However, we are confident the moves we have made and are continuing to make will resolve the current situation.”The facility features two golf courses, the Hawkshill which opened in , and the Swailend which was built seven years later.It has hosted a number of high-end golf tournaments, including the EuroPro Tour event last month with the Newmachar Challenge, screened on Sky Sports this week.One member, who has been with the club for more than a decade and asked not to be named, said: “One question I have is why it took so long for something to be sent out to members.“I think the club has looked into the levy further and realised that they wouldn’t be able to do it.“The amount of members they would have lost by doing it would have spelled the death knell for the club.”A club spokesman said: “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the overall cost of the driving range project was higher than anticipated. The driving range that members helped fund has been operational since May and has already proved profitable.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45865279-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45865279-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45865279-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45865279-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"forum to look into eye health in scotland","story":"A forum has been set up to help improve eye health in Scotland.The Scottish Eyecare for Everyonenetwork was established on the back of a conference held at Aberdeen University last week.It was organised by Optometry Scotland and Dr Alexandros Zangelidis, head of economics at the university business school, and brought together representatives from the Scottish Government, NHS and the RNIB.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s.

Someone needs to get a grip of this in Kilmory and at the HSCP.The weather helped, but the Mid Argyll Triathlon seemed to be a major success yet again.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"diary-large-glasgows-west-end-blossoming-burgeoning-blooming","story":"The Diary at Large: #Glasgow’s West End is blossoming.

The Pacic Ocean lapped lazily nearby. It was the only lazy thing in LA. Everything  was go, go, go.Including Douglas, bracing himself for the night ahead. Would Whitney Houston slink into the club  Possibly. Shersquod been before. Those fresh-faced celebrity brats would certainly be coming. The Beverley Hills  kids couldnrsquot stay away. Or the gang from Friends.As Douglas stood there, Hollywood happy, Calornia content, his thoughts kept sneaking away from him. They clambered over the Hollywood sign, swam the pacic ocean, thumbed a lt to Glasgow. And came to rest in the West End of that faraway city.Douglas Timmins, now , has led an extraordinary le. He has seen it all, been it all. Survived more scrapes than a schoolboyrsquos knee. Travelled extensively, too. But Glasgowrsquos West End always draws him back.ldquoFor a Glasgow boy like me, living and working in Hollywood was a dream come true, Douglas tells me.ldquoEven so, every now and again that feeling would come over me. Irsquod realise I was thousands of miles from home. All of a sudden it seemed a really, really long way. I missed my friends. I missed the West End of Glasgow.The West End is where I bump into Douglas, a legendary figure in these parts. Hersquos been a fixture here, on and off, since the late s, when he worked as a barman at a local drinking den. There have been many jobs, and many Douglases, since those days. Hersquos a fascinating group of people. And a good person to chat toyou truly want to understand the bohemian enclave that is Glasgowrsquos West End.This part of town has always been a little bit dferent. The people are a puzzle to the uninitiated. They march to their own drum. Booze and womanisingThe West Endrsquos unique culture was recently celebrated when Time Out magazine voted it the coolest place to live in Scotland.Which brings me back to Douglas, who is certainly cool in that quirky, quixotic way that can only be experienced in this part of town.His personality is too huge, and barnacled in eccentricities, to fit in comfortably anywhere . With his voice like tractor tyres crunching through pebbles, and a face more weathered than a Mount Rushmore President, he seems to have sauntered straight out of a Damon Runyon short story. Douglas Timmons is a Guys and Dolls sorta guy.And, like so many West Enders, he has tales to tell. Raised in Mount Vernon, he hitched up his wagon and followed the trail west after hearing from a friend that glamorous Swedish blondes were in much abundance in this part of town.No Swedish blondes did Douglas find, though he stuck around anyway, and became a settler. Douglas has enjoyed a iety of jobs. He trained as a tailor, though left after a member of the Calton Tong, who frequented the shop where Douglas worked, threatened him with a kne and demanded the contents of the till.ldquoHe happened to be standing next to a hatch that led down to this cavernous cellar, says Douglas. ldquoSo I just pushed him down. He broke his legs and all his mates came back to get me. I decided it was an excellent time to leave that particular job.A wide range of occupations followed. Douglas worked briefly as a journalist. He inserted free gts in comics. He worked in the metal industry, where he met David Murray, a close friend. He set up a modelling agency, and hired a young unknown called Carol Smillie.He also opened a West End bar and revelled in booze and womanising. Thus his dosh was squandered, and he nearly lost his le, too, when an unforgiving ex hired hitmen to bump him off.ldquoYou always think plotters are intelligent, Douglas muses. ldquoBut not necessarily. What should be straight forward and simple becomes complicated, and they talk everything to death. They go and tell somebody, who tells you. And you stop it.And how did Douglas prevent this attempt on his le ldquoLetrsquos just say there was a pavement debate with the chap who arranged my assassination, says Douglas, enigmatically.It was another failed romance that led Douglas to flee to America in the early s, where he found employment as a gym instructor. world, and had only recently stopped boozing and smoking fags.Next he worked in nightclubs, as a bouncer and manager. He even got mixed up in the LA riots, and, at one point, worked as a bodyguard for a Russian billionaire who lived near Bob Dylanrsquos Malibu pad.ldquoHe was a legend for not paying his bills, says Douglas. ldquoAnd people would come after him. So he handed me a pump-action shotgun and a Smith  Wesson . I told him I didnrsquot have a license to use guns. I didnrsquot even have a licence to be in America.Eventually Douglas ed to Glasgow and his beloved West End, where he still enjoys meeting new people, and immersing himself in the local culture. ldquoThe West End is blossoming, itrsquos burgeoning, itrsquos blooming, he says. ldquoAnd thatrsquos what I love. Whenever I travel away, I have to come back.I know what Douglas means.Opium denEven the local second-hand bookstore, Voltaire  Rousseau, is a joy to visit. Imagine Waterstones after an earthquake, and yoursquoll begin to understand the special ambience that permeates VR.In Waterstones the books stand rigid and regimented. In VR they sprawl and lounge and hunker in heaps.These mounds of literature donrsquot demand to be read, they yearn to be bagged, like a Munro. While browsing in this Aladdinrsquos bazaar I spot a voluptuous and decadent cushion lying atop a towering babel of ancient Bibles. You can almost imagine a debauched aristocrat resting his head upon such a pillow in some s opium den.A moment later that same pillow yawns, stretches and purrs. It turns out to be a cat who lives in the shop. His name is B.B. Just another West End hipster.Animals are definitely as exotic as their owners in this neck of the woods. As are their tastes. A local pet store sells Pawseco lsquowinersquo for cats and dogs.Even the hairdressers arenrsquot content to merely snip the fuzzy tops of customerrsquos heads.Joseph Goss, who owns Rum Barber, tells me hersquos also a filmmaker.He, and his business partner, Paul Montgomery, have set up their own YouTube channel, where they create wacky hairdressing content with special effects.They already have over twenty-two thousand subscribers, many in America, where their fanbase is growing rapidly.Such a buzzThis can-do creativity and ability to think beyond borders is very much a West End aesthetic.ldquoWersquore trying our best to be media stars, laughs Joseph. ldquoOur films arenrsquot exactly James Cameronesque. But they are fun little quirky things that hopefully make us stand out from the crowd.Standing out from the crowd is exactly what the Ubiquitous Chip on Ashton Lane has been doing since opening in .In many ways itrsquos the epicentre of the West End, a boho bar and restaurant where the edgier boys and girls hang out, hob knob and raise hell. Gabriel Etchells is marketing assistant at the Chip. The twenty-two-year-old graduated from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen last year. Now settled in the West End, the area reminds her of her days and nights hitting the textbooks. ldquoWith Glasgow University nearby, itrsquos very student orientated, she says. ldquoBut the West Endrsquos unique because itrsquos such a mix of young and old. You have the history, the culture, the art and music. Then therersquos the young people coming in, shaking things up, making their presence felt.ldquoIrsquod say the West End is always flowing, yet never moving. Itrsquos such a unique place. It really is a buzz to live here."},{"url":null,"title":"david-suchet-feel-like-outsider-country","story":"He treasures the trinkets because of the man they used to belong to: Hercule Poirot, the detective Suchet played on television for  years. When the great actor finally relinquished the role after filming every single story that Agatha Christie wrote, the television company gave him the mementos of his time as Poirot and he says he likes to keep them close by. He also has Poirotrsquos cane. ldquoEvery time I hold that cane, he says, ldquoI can feel him.The cane is particularly special, says Suchet, because of the powers it had when he was playing Poirot it worked like a kind of talisman, a way for him to transform himself from British actor to Belgian detective. Just before he started filming, he would get the cane out and walk around the garden like Poirot, quick, little steps. He would also speak out loud like him and try to look at the world through his eyes, a man who liked order, symmetry and detail. If the pictures on the walls of his house werenrsquot straight, he would straighten them. If the eggs he had for breakfast werenrsquot precisely the same size, he would disapprove. And once in character, he would keep it up and maintain the accent and performance even when he was speaking to his we.To people who arenrsquot actorsthis might sound a bit weird, but Suchet was utterly committed and methodical when it came to playing Poirot. When he first got the part, he went through the novels and listed every single detail of Poirotrsquos habits and gestures. He also made a list of ways in which he was similar to, and dferent from, the detective and the similarities were striking. Occasionally in real le ndash sans moustache, sans Belgian accent, sans everything ndash Suchetrsquos words and phrases can even sound like Poirotrsquos.Take, for example, the moment we get talking about nostalgia and regrets. ldquoWe do not know the webs we spin, he says, ldquoand itrsquos only when you look back that you say, look at how that led to thatrsquo.Itrsquos the kind of thing Poirot might say while summing up the facts at the end of one of his cases, but itrsquos also how Suchet likes to look at his le. We humans donrsquot know what wersquore spinning as we go through le, he says, but then we turn around and see the shape of what wersquove been building.And so, over coffee on the bank of the Thames, we follow some of the threads of silk back through Suchetrsquos le and find the man who taught him how to feel emotions and the father he was never close to. We also find his faith in God and his fear of death and his feeling, always, of being an outsider and of being on the edge. Poirot also fades in and out as we talk, pointing out, with his usual knack for being right, how alike he is to man who played him.But first, Suchet, , wants to do something. He picks up the camera he carries with him almost everywhere. Wersquore sitting right by Tower Bridge but Suchet isnrsquot interested in such London clicheacutes. Hersquos more interested in the salt cellar and glass on the table in front of us. He points the camera. His forehead tightens, his forefinger slides on the focus. There. Done. ldquoI just wanted to capture the light from outside on the glass, he says. ldquoWhat nature had done to it. Oh, look. The momentrsquos gone. Itrsquos stopped. Itrsquos gone.I ask where he gets this passion for photography, which forms the basis of his new book Behind the Lens, and he tells me about one of the most important threads of silk in his le: his grandfather, Jimmy Jarche. Jarche was a newspaper photographer and Suchet particularly remembers the smell of the Syrian pipe tobacco he used to smoke. He also remembers the way Jimmy behaved with him as a boy: he held him a lot, Suchetrsquos arms wound round his grandfatherrsquos neck. Suchet could also talk to Jimmy in a way that he never could to his father.ldquoMy father was a man of his time, says Suchet, who has two adult children with his we Shelia. ldquoHe was of his type. He was South African and arrived in this country as an outsider and became an insider because he became this brilliant surgeon. But he developed an Edwardian attitude and part of his personality was that he couldnrsquot open up. He was closed emotionally, quite unlike me. Suchet says he finds it easy to love he enjoys loving.The relationship with his father was always a problem though ndash in fact, Suchet says they never really had what you could call a father son relationship it also meant Suchetrsquos father struggled to express his pride in his son when he started to have success as an actor. ldquoHe would show off photographs of his children in his office and say how proud he was, but never to us. But I was lucky to have Jimmy who allowed me to have an emotional relationship with an older man who guided me in my le.He tells me a story to show what he means. If his grandfather saw a beggar on the street, he says, he would sit down next to him and have a chat and askthere was anything he could do and Suchet says he still feels the influence of that attitude today. As we talk, people approach the table and ask for selfies and autographs and Suchet is friendly and smiling, always.ldquoJimmy is why I donrsquot hold myself above anybody, he says. ldquoIf Irsquom well known and famous, thatrsquos happened to me but I donrsquot see myself as anybody dferent from anybody . Wersquore all travellers wersquore on the same escalator and wersquore all going to drop off at the top. If wersquore lucky, of course. Some people drop off half way through.Which leads to the other great influence Jimmy has had on Suchet. He tells me that, after his grandfather died, he carried on speaking to Jimmy in his head. And then something weird happened. Suchet was lying in the bath in America one day, in the s, thinking about Jimmy when a thought struck him: Why am I thinking like this, when I donrsquot even believe in an afterle  Jimmyrsquos not there. Which got him thinking about the afterle a bit more. He bought a Bible and read Paulrsquos letter to the Christians in Rome and began the process that led to him finding his faith.It took a long time ndash around  years in fact, which reflects one of the similarities between Suchet and Poirot: their methodical approach to work and le. After that moment in America, Suchet researched religion and read and read and read until he could get to what he calls a point of hope and mystery.ldquoI canrsquot have blind faith, he says. ldquoBut Irsquom comfortable to live within a mystery. We are only comfortable with a calculator. We need clear answers. I canrsquot give you a clear answer I canrsquot even persuade you. I wouldnrsquot want to persuade you. Interestingly, Suchet says his grandfather was an atheist. ldquoBut in a sense he was the epitome of faith. Loving and caring about other people and giving and being generous with himself.Suchet recognises that this belief and his faith make him a little dferent in a country thatrsquos more likely to believe in Richard Dawkins The God Delusion than The Bible, but he has become used to the status of outsider, in his own country and even in his own profession. He is not a great fan of theatricality, he says, nor is he a great socialite and doesnrsquot much like theatrical parties. ldquoIrsquom always on the edge, he says. ldquoBecause therersquos a lot of me thatrsquos quite introvert. I donrsquot enjoy that side of my profession. I feel awkward in it.Suchetrsquos heritage has also made him feel dferent in other ways. ldquoI donrsquot know why, but I relate to the outsider, maybe because my blood line is Lithuanian Jew, brought up third generation British, he says. Itrsquos also made him aware of how Britain, and London in particular, welcomes, or doesnrsquot welcome, incomers.ldquoI love London, he says, ldquobut I canrsquot bear hearing people say, lsquooh, itrsquos so full of foreignersrsquo. Do you know why itrsquos so full of foreigners  Because everybody wants to be here and itrsquos a funny thing: everybody that comes here become Londoners, they fall in love with it. We welcome people. Itrsquos the only moment in our conversation where Suchet gets angry.But here, too, there are similarities with Poirot ndash Christiersquos great detective was an immigrant, a Belgian living in London and sometimes coming up against thoughtlessness and racism. What are the other parallels  Both men are fastidious ndash Suchet says he would sometimes drive the costume department barmy with his attention to detail. Both men also despise chaos ndash before he starts a job, Suchet has to start with a completely cleared desk. ldquoI will feel chaos deep within me, he says. ldquoI have to get rid of it, because it affects me. I have to feel calm and ordered, deep inside.We shouldnrsquot exaggerate the similarities of course, but Suchet does talk about an incident that seems to emphasise them ndash for viewers and Suchet himself. It happened when one of the Poirot films was being made in Hastings. There was a break in filming and Suchet had gone for a walk. He was in full costume and standing in an ordinary street. Suddenly a little old lady came up the hill towards him. She stopped. ldquoOoohh. Ohhhh. Hello, Mr Poirot, she said. Suchet didnrsquot know quite what to do so said ldquoHello, madame as Poirot. lsquoOooohh, ooohh,rsquo she went. lsquoI watch you all the time, Mr Poirot. What you doing here, though  There ainrsquot been a murder, has there rsquoSuchet replied, lsquoNo, madame. There has been no murder, not here in Hastings.rsquo lsquoWhat are you doing here then rsquo she asked. lsquoI am on holiday,rsquo I replied, lsquoI am en vacances.rsquo lsquoOh, thatrsquos nice. Lovely. And off she went.Itrsquos a moving little story and revealing about Suchet. He says he didnrsquot want to disillusion the old lady but he was also deep in character when she turned up right in the middle of the serious business of being the Poirot that Agatha Christie created. ldquoThatrsquos my reason for being an actor, he says. ldquoTo serve the writer.It can make it hard to move on to the next stage though, particularly with Poirot. ldquoI got to know Poirot after  stories and  years and Irsquove been in nearly every situation with him in le and I know how he reacts and Irsquove reacted with him because hersquos me. So I know him as well as I would know any best friend. And he dies. Hersquos gone. Irsquom grieving. Irsquove lost a friend. I can bring him back but only in my memory, like Jimmy.Which brings us, via the web of le, to the other metaphor that Suchet used earlier: the escalator, the one that wersquore all and the one that eventually ends. Suchet tells me that he likes to go on retreat to find peace and quiet, but he says there are still little and big fears and concerns that bug him. He worries, for example, about what he calls the dangerous society we live in ndash dangerous because more and more people seem obsessed with fame. You have to be careful not to live your le for other peoplersquos praise, he says.But Suchet also worries about more personal things. In the old days, he says,there was something on his mind, his grandfather Jimmy would tell him to come and sit with him. Often, Suchet wouldnrsquot know what to say but Jimmy would tell him: it doesnrsquot matter, just sit with me. These days, Suchet has his family and his faith.So how does he feel about the escalator of le  ldquoIrsquom frightened of death, he says, ldquoand nobody has come back since Christ to tell me whatrsquos beyond. You get people who say, my faith makes me convinced and I say to them, yoursquore so lucky. But he tries to rationalise the fear. Wersquore all on the same escalator, he says, sweeping his arm round the room. ldquoJust accept it, he says, ldquoDonrsquot worry about worrying.Behind the Lens: My Le by David Suchet is published by Constable at pound.

One positive is that it is now somewhat easier to focus on a smaller number of potential outcomes rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number of iables.The challenges posed by a no-deal Brexit will have an obvious impact on manufacturing companies that are engaged in import and export with the EU. ldquoWe are dealing with a lot of very niche queries at the moment, related to specic areas and sectors of business, says Livingstone. ldquoThere is clearly a lot of interest in immigration matters and settled status for employees and family members who are already living in Scotland but beyond that there is no one principal theme that is dominating the agenda, the queries we are receiving are all quite business specic.Larger clients, he points out, have the obvious advantage of possessing the personnel and financial resources to cope with that and the more heavily regulated businesses have already done their preparation some time ago. ldquoMany of these companies who already operate outside the EU and have a presence there will have import export procedures in place and while they would see a dference in volume, the procedures would not necessarily be substantially dferent from what they are already used to.It is the smaller companies and those in the SME sector who may not have done enough planning, and businesses who only import from, or export to, the EU who would see the most change. ldquoThese businesses will have to become familiar with procedures that will be new to them, he says.For many the administrative burden seems daunting but Livingstone stresses that there are some major areas that Brodies is encouraging clients to focus on. ldquoIn terms of importing and exporting the main area to address is Economic Operators Registration and Identicationnumbers. This is one of the major things that businesses can take control of. If a business only deals with import or export declarations in the UK, with a customer client completing the equivalent declaration on the EU side of the border, it will only need a UK EORI number andregistered for UK VAT, a number should already have been assigned by HMRC.However,the firm is responsible for completing both the export declaration as goods leave the UK, as well as the import declaration when the goods are imported into the EU,it will need both a UK and an EU EORI number. ldquoThe need to have two EORI numbers in certain circumstances, says Livingstone, ldquois not an issue that has been very visible to businesses.The UK Government, he says has published a series of ldquotechnical notices providing guidance on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, including  notices on importing and exporting. The notice on existing EU trade deals with non EU countries states the UK Governmentrsquos intention to replicate those EU arrangements in bilateral UK agreements.ldquoThe plan is for the status quo with non-EU countries to be maintained through any transitional period agreed with the EU, but in a no-deal scenario trade with third countries would default to World Trade Organizationrules until a replacement bilateral agreement could be established. Businesses trading with third countries on the basis of EU agreements, whether directly or via their supply chains, should carefully consider how changes to trade rules would impact them .And while some businesses, particularly in the SME sector, are possibly assuming another extension to Article  on the basis of some of the current rhetoric and media reporting around the Benn Act, Livingstone stresses that Parliament can instruct the UK Government but cannot dictate the EUrsquos response. ldquoSo our message to clients is that this is not a situation where Parliament, or any one party, is entirely in control of what will happen.ldquoBusinesses should be aware of the challenges and perhaps the opportunities of Brexit that are specic to them ndash what they are exposed to and what are their sectorrsquos risks in relation to any exit, he says. In short, try to avoid surprises.The right to move goods freely could end this month.Exporting and importing may become much more complicatedIN the event of a no-deal Brexit, the right to move goods freely between the UK and the EU would fall away as of pm on October st, , and trade would revert to World Trade Organizationrules.As a result,you trade with the EUyou may have to comply with the more onerous customs, excise and VAT procedures and rules that already apply to goods traded with non-EU countries ndash in a no-deal scenario the UK and EU will treat goods moving between them in the same way they currently treat trade with those countries .Full import and export declarations, and separate safety and security declarations, may therefore be required.An EORI numberis currently required to trade goods with non-EU countries, and so will also be required to trade with the EU in a no-deal scenario .In a no-deal scenario a range of goods would become liable to tarfs.For goods exported to the EU, the relevant customs duty set out in the EUrsquos Common Customs Tarf would apply.Goods coming into the UK from the EU would become subject to a new UK tarf.This would include imports from the EU .If you export to or import from non-EU countries, you should be considering whether those are among the  or so countries that have a free trade agreement with the EU, andso how the UKrsquos status under that agreement might be affected by Brexit.In any transition period the intention would be for the EU, UK and third countries to continue to act asthe UK remains an EU Member State. If there is no deal the UK Government is aiming to put bilateral agreements in place with the relevant countries as quickly as possible and has already signed a number of ldquocontinuity trade agreements.However, there is likely to be a gap between Brexit and some agreements entering into force, and not all agreements are on track to be lsquorolled overrsquo in time or at all, which would mean trade with the relevant countriesreverting to the same WTO terms as UK-EU trade.Manufacturers should conduct reviews to keep goods flowingIF you are a UK manufacturer of goods that are subject to EU-wide standards you should review whether your existing conformity assessments and certications will continue to be recognised in the EU. You should also review whether you will need to obtain separate UK certication to cover use of your products in the UK.UK bodies approved by the EU for certication purposes will no longer be recognised by the EU, so in a no-deal scenario the results of conformity assessments carried out by those bodies will no longer be recognised either.Products assessed by UK bodies will therefore no longer be able to be placed on the EU market unless they have been reassessed and re-marked by a body that remains EU-recognised, or the manufacturerrsquos files are transferred to an EU-recognised body pre-Brexit. CE marking based on self-declaration of conformity will still be possible, including when exporting to the EU.More detail is available in the EUrsquos preparedness notice and accompanying QA document on industrial products .The UK Government has also published its own guidance on placing manufactured goods on the EU internal market . Meanwhile, the UK Government plans to introduce a new UK mark for new products, to indicate compliance with UK standards .Products that have a European CE marking will still be able to be placed on the UK market, though that option will be time-limited for products certied post-Brexit, and so a duplicate UK marking may ultimately be required.This article appeared in The Herald on the th October For more information please visit www.brodies"},{"url":null,"title":"firm-cash-bid-make-plant-based-construction-material","story":"IndiNature, based in Edinburgh, needs pound. million to build the technology that will produce the material made from UK-grown hemp and flax.Scott Simpson, managing director, has been developing the innovative material for three years and the company aims to be operational by the end of next year.Mr Simpson believes the potential impact of the insulation, which is bonded using a natural binder he invented, is ldquoabsolutely gigantic.He said: ldquoThe construction sector takes about half of global natural resources at the moment and we solve that problem by using renewable resources- annual crops.The industry also accounts for  per cent of global carbon emissions through the manufacture, transport and construction of building materials as well as operational emissions.And at least  per cent of Scotlandrsquos overall waste is produced by the sector, according to Zero Waste Scotland.Mr Simpson said: ldquoWe solve all those problems with our product. We save carbon because we make a really high quality energy efficient system but the biggest impact is that we knock about a quarter of the construction carbon footprint off the average UK house because we store more carbon in the products than the amount that was needed to make them.IndiNaturersquos production is estimated to use around an eighth less energy than standard glass and rock wool insulation, and their use of naturally carbon storing crops that pull carbon dioxide from the air makes their material almost carbon neutral.The industrial hemp and flax crops are naturally resilient too, taking unexpected weather iations such as flooding in their stride.Currently the supply chain is based in the north of England but Scottish farmers who want to revive the traditional crops previously used to supply the navy with anchor ropes and rigging are in talks with the company.It was while renovating his own home with eco materials that Mr Simpson discovered that not all sustainable building products are created equally.After importing apparently eco insulation, he noticed that it was bound with petro-plastics, negating the companyrsquos environmental credentials.He said: ldquoI thought I was doing the eco thing but when I read the text-sheet it said it used petro-chemicals and it was eye wateringly expensive so I thought, why donrsquot we do this here in Scotland With a background in community development, Mr Simpson worked in housing and saw people living in ldquoterrible conditions.He said: ldquoHouses were damp, [people] couldnrsquot afford to heat them, there was black mould and fuel poverty.It was during a masters in Sustainable Architecture that Mr Simpson started developing the materials he now uses to produce the insulation he thinks will revolutionise the construction industry.He said: ldquoI thought,you can solve the built environment problem, you can solve a lot of problems.ldquoIf you know to design the built environment in a holistic way with sustainable materials that will have a huge impact on peoplersquos health and reduce the impacts on the environment.A site had been secured in Hawick to build their first factory, close to their farm supply chain. As well as working with Scottish farmers in the future, IndiNature hope to boost employment in the area.The insulation can be retro-fitted into homes and businesses, allowing for current social housing developments to benefit from the technology. Mr Simpson is in talks with local authorities, contractors and big firms who ldquoknow they need to move into the sector.The company has plans for expansion with their global replication model that will build factories overseas.Mr Simpson said: ldquoI used to be involved with building nice little bespoke homes for wealthy people which is great but there was nothing being done on an industrial scale.ldquoGlobally we aim to be a pound million plus business but with one factory wersquore looking at a poundm turnover.\""},{"url":null,"title":"property-developer-says-giving-dream-build-specialist-dementia-home-bute","story":"The property developer and her husband, Ian, purchased the seafront plot south-east of Rothesay in , and was granted planning permission for her Ascog Park project a year later.However, the land remains empty and Mrs Woollcott says she is on the verge of abandoning the scheme after becoming exasperated with the local council and Health and Social Care Partnership.\"Im at the end of my tether with it now,\" she said. \"Im seriously just thinking about selling the land.

But UK ministers and officials suspect much of the money has not been used for the purpose they insist it is intended.A senior UK Government source told The Herald: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos accounting is opaque to say the least. Without greater clarity, the suspicion will be that they are not serious about preparing for Brexit.ldquoWhile apparently opposing no-deal they have consistently refused to support a deal. It really does look asthey are hoping for a disruptive Brexit in the belief it would drive support for independence. They need to prepare for Brexit, not prepare for a blame game.One example given was how the Scottish Government was failing to hand over allocated money to local councils so that enough staff could be employed to provide the health certicates that will be needed for Scottish fish exporters to send their produce to the continent post a no-deal Brexit.If the export of perishable fish products from Scotland were disrupted, it is feared restaurants and food outlets such as in France, the Benelux countries and Spain would seek out other producers, which could have a devastating impact on Scotlandrsquos important fishing industry, threatening jobs and livelihoods.David Duguid, the Conservative MP for Banff and Buchan, said he had for months been in contact with local and central government about preparations for a no-deal Brexit but feared not enough was being done in Scotland.He referred to how in February it was announced more than poundm was being made available to the Scottish Government to prepare but ldquonot a penny had made its way to the local authorities.But in the spring, Michael Russell, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, insisted the money had been ldquodistributed across the portfolios and was being used across the public sector.Mr Duguid told The Herald: ldquoIrsquom in favour of a deal, the UK Government is in favour of a deal but we still have to be prepared for a no-deal.ldquoMy fear is that, should there be a no-deal Brexit, the Scottish Government have not done their jobhellipI hope they are not playing silly games, allowing the fishing industry to fail. What would they saythe rest of the UK was prepared for no-deal and they werenrsquot Askedhe felt the SNP administration was deliberately trying to cause disruption over Brexit to further the independence cause, Mr Duguid replied:ldquoThere is always a suspicion the SNP will use anything to pump up the cause of independence. I hope that is not the case.Meanwhile, a UK Government spokeswoman explained: ldquoThe Scottish Government have received almost poundm in funding for EU exit preparation. It is the responsibility of the Scottish Government to decide where this money is spent to ensure Scotland is prepared for leaving the EU on October .ldquoAdditionally, all three devolved administrations can bid for[money from] the Operational Contingency Fund of poundbn, where they face disproportionate pressures to England.In July, Scottish Labour accused Derek Mackay, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Finance Secretary, of ldquoblowing a hole in Scotlandrsquos Brexit preparations after it was revealed, at the time, that of the pound. million allocated for them in  , Edinburgh had spent around poundm on other things.Of the pound.m allocated for  , UK Government officials say there appear to be no details of expenditure. ldquoThey canrsquot say how they spent it, noted one.Thus far, the Scottish Governmentrsquos extra funds allocated on the back of the UK Governmentrsquos spending on Brexit have been: pound.m in   pound.m in   pound.m for   announced in February and .m also for   announced in August. This brings the total to pound.m.In addition, the Scottish Government has asked for poundm from the contingency fund for Brexit preparations to cover, among other things, support for rural communities in the event of a no-deal outcome, Police Scotland activities, additional communication to EU citizens and poverty mitigation measures.A UK Government spokesman said Edinburghrsquos request would be considered in the ldquousual way. If granted, this would, according to the Treasuryrsquos view, mean the Scottish Government will have received more than poundm for Brexit preparations.Thus far, the UK Exchequer has, overall, made more than poundbn available to prepare for Brexit since the  referendum, including pound.bn specically for no-deal planning.However, funds have been handed over to the Scottish Government via the Barnett Formula, which allocates a proportionate share of departmental spending increases and decreases made in England to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland based on population share.Crucially, while the UK Government might want Edinburgh to spend the money for the same purpose it is being used in England, the Scottish Government is entitled to spend it how it likes.A spokesman for Mr Russell said: \"These are gobsmacking comments from the Tories. Scotland did not vote for Brexit and we should not be having to spend a single penny on Brexit preparations ndash this is similar to an arsonist setting fire to someonersquos house and then complaining about the fire servicersquos efforts to extinguish the blaze.ldquoThe fact is, the Scottish Government has allocated proportionately the same Brexit preparation funding to local authorities as the UK Government from the consequentials received to date. Local authorities can submit further funding requests for EU exit costs through the submission of a business case. This process has been put in place for all public sector bodies ndash and local government are not being treated dferently.ldquoVirtually all of the pound.m in consequentials we have received from the UK Government have been allocated ndash but even then, the true cost of Brexit is expected to far exceed this amount.

The surrounding wasteland has also been transformed into a landscaped valley featuring paths and sculptures which recognise the arearsquos industrial heritage.Other projects have included the creation of the UKrsquos largest rock ramp, a fish ladder which connects the lower and upper reaches of the River Almond at Howden Bridge Weir in West Lothian. Opened last month, it allows fish to travel upstream for the first time in over  years and is one of a series of projects which has opened km of river to migratory fish species and improved overall river quality.The Tollcross Burn project will restore a section of the previously covered waterway which was culverted through Sandyhills Park in the s to make way for a now demolished housing project.Work will start this month to remove it from its concrete case, so it can once again become a focal point for park visitors, stimulate bioersity and also provide natural flood prevention.Francis Hayes, SEPArsquos WEF Restoration Specialist, said: ldquoIn terms of what you can do to a river, putting it in a concrete pipe and burying it is the worst.ldquoTollcross Burn was culverted in s and erted. Since then, people have been living next to a river but had no idea it was there, they werenrsquot able to see it or enjoy it.ldquoAs a river, itrsquos dead, he added. ldquoFish donrsquot like to travel in dark spaces and canrsquot go up a smooth concrete channel, therersquos no habitat for insects that are vital for river wildle and no light. So itrsquos very dficult for animals and plants to survive.ldquoWe want to make it a living, thriving river.The improvements, which are being carried out in partnership with Glasgow City Council and have received pound.m funding from Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal, will introduce a new -metre open channel which will follow the original course of the burn.As well as improving the natural surroundings, it will help reduce the flood risk caused by the climate emergency and extend the arearsquos sewage capacity. There are also plans to restore and tackle historically contaminated ground in the area.At the same time, work is set to start on measures tomigrating fish to Garrell Burn beside the Dumbreck Marsh nature reserve at Kilsyth.The burn was canalised and while the previously industrial area has now developed into a valued wetland used by runners, walkers, cyclists, pet owners, children and commuters, manmade structures prevent fish from migrating.Work will be carried out by SEPA, North Lanarkshire Council and Scottish Water to naturalise the river, helping to restore flood plains and create fish passes.Dozens of river improvement projects, many of which remove barriers that prevent fish from accessing spawning areas and raised the risk of flooding, have been carried out since the Fund was introduced in .They include work at Gottar Water Weir at Quarrierrsquos Village, Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire, where a post-industrial weir had blocked access to km of habitat for migratory fish species such as Atlantic salmon, sea trout and eel for over a century.The existing weir is to be partly lowered, increasing the downstream water level and improving the water quality, as well as providing new community leisure opportunities.Mr Hayes said there are hopes that improvement works can be carried out at most ndashnot all ndash of the  rivers negatively affected by manmade structures before .The improvement works could help correct two centuries of damage to Scotlandrsquos rivers caused by industrial and urban growth.Prior to the rapid growth of industry and urbanisation of the s, Scotlandrsquos rivers were regarded as being of very good quality. However, river quality deteriorated throughout the th and th centuries, largely due to the discharge of sewage, and agricultural and industrial pollution, and manmade efforts to alter their course which have led to the loss of habitat and prevented fish migration.Since , the Water Environment Fund has helped open up more than km of rivers to salmon and other fish species, while flood prevention work has also been carried out to help make rivers more resilient to the impact of the climate emergency.One of the largest projects is an ambitious partnership plan to revitalise the River Leven, West Dunbartonshire, and turn land which once housed several hundred mills and factories into a lsquogo-torsquo leisure and tourism destination.The project includes removing barriers to fish migration and improving water quality.Mr Hayes said: ldquoPeople were smart in the past but they had dferent information and dferent knowledge from today and we are suffering from that legacy.ldquoRoads, services and railways were being built and rivers were seen as an inconvenience. They were pushed out of the way and then it was a case of lsquoout of sight out of mindrsquo.ldquoWe have damaged rivers and blocked them off to fish. We donrsquot want to hand that legacy to the next generation, so we are trying to do something about it.ldquoBy pulling resources and sharing expertise we can bring a better landscape in often deprived areas. If we restore a river it becomes a nice, natural place people want to be in, it promotes sustainable transport with cycleways and itrsquos a good thing for health and well-being."},{"url":null,"title":"seeds-change-gardening-saving-peoples-lives","story":"The wind was howling and in one of the worst snowstorms in living memory, Francesca Rychel left home without her winter coat and vanished into the wild blizzard.It would take several hours and the efforts of mountain rescue teams and snfer dogs to find her on a nearby hillside, severely hypothermic and barely alive.She woke in hospital days later, furious. ldquoI was angry, she recalls. ldquoI didnrsquot want to be there having to deal with things.ldquoI was so low, I didnrsquot get out of bed.

Left by her bed by a thoughtful nurse, the simple act of planting the seeds and watching them grow would become her motivation to slowly get better.Today, mother-of-two Fran, , is among the volunteers at Space to Grow, a therapeutic garden a stonersquos throw from the Huntlyburn mental health unit at Borders General Hospital in Melrose, which is gently nurturing green shoots of recovery from vulnerable and frail patients.Originally an acre of forgotten land battling against waist-high brambles and choking weeds, it has been coaxed into le by patients, volunteers and staff to become a busy allotment where cheerful flowers bloom and a healthy crop of runner beans, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, courgettes, cucumber and herbs thrive. The therapeutic gardening it provides is increasingly recognised as delivering a range of health benefits, from boosting physical and mental health, to promoting conversation and stimulating thinking skills.In recent years, hundreds of small therapeutic gardens and community allotments have sprung up across the country. Most are manned by devoted volunteers who tease overgrown and unloved land into vegetable plots, mini orchards, flower beds, and where potting sheds double as a focal point for socialising and cups of tea.According to Fiona Thackeray of gardening charity Trellis, which provides guidance and support for almost  therapeutic gardening projects across Scotland, new ones are springing up at an average of one every week.ldquoWhen we first started the charity  years ago, people would look at me a little askance when I mentioned the therapeutic impact of gardening, she says. ldquoBut the evidence has built up such a lot since then.ldquoWe now have up to  new garden projects coming to us every year looking for help and support.ldquoThese gardens are helping people to meet other people, recover from severe mental illnesses, get back to work, regain their motivation and receive support.Some gardens provide a space for refugees to share support and discover what kinds of plants, fruits and vegetables they can grow on Scottish soil.Some in the grounds of nursing homes provide gentle activity for residents with dementia, while community gardens lure lonely people from home to meet new friends. Others encourage addicts to find solace in nature or provide calm space for cancer, heart attack or stroke patients.For Fran, the small packet of seeds, flowerpot and soil left by Jan Moffat, the mental health nurse who developed Borders Hospitalrsquos Space to Grow garden, would be le-changing.ldquoJan brought in a packet of seeds, soil and the plant pot and just left them at my bedside table. I stared at them for a week, then one day decided to plant the seeds.ldquoThat meant I had to get up to get water for them. When they got too big for the pot, I had to get dressed and repot them down in the greenhouse. It meant I had a reason to get up. Then I had to eat because I needed the energy to do what I wanted in the garden. I started to re-engage with le.It was, she adds, ldquotransformational.ldquoI now feel like myself for the first time in  years, she says. ldquoIrsquom working full time and Irsquom able to do more with my children. Without the garden, I might not be here at all.Jan Moffat, meanwhile, has seen the garden bring a range of benefits, from the patient who uses it as a peaceful spot to meditate to another who suffered agitated outbursts but now works off excess energy in the garden.ldquoFor some itrsquos a break from boredom of the ward, she adds, ldquowhile for others that link from nature gives them some respite from how they feel.There are hopes the garden will eventually provide similar therapeutic benefits to other hospital patients in the future.Similar therapy gardens are thriving across the country. At Silverburn Park in Leven, Fe. work is under way to turn a B-listed former flax mill and gardens into a ldquoCentre for Wellbeing while Trellis fieldworkers are supporting volunteers in a revitalised walled garden and sensory garden.In Paisley, a therapeutic garden is supporting ex-offenders, and in North Ayrshire another provides therapy for head injury patients.In West Dunbartonshire, the Leamy Foundation gardens are helping to combat the loneliness and isolation that can lead to depression and anxiety. As well as boosting mood and self-esteem, they are teaching new skills and helping children understand the links between food, waste and nature.Launched after a consultation with local foodbanks revealed around one-third of people attending identied as having mental health concerns, it has led to self-managed gardens popping up on spare plots of land in Alexandria housing estates and in raised beds at St Mungorsquos Episcopal Church, where kale, sweetcorn, tomatoes, herbs and potatoes are growing alongside apple and plum trees and strawberries.A partnership with West Dunbartonshire Council led to a network of community garden and allotment groups, while the foundation has also helped an addiction service launch a therapeutic garden of its own.ldquoWe saw the isolation, anxiety and depression, says project development manager Kevin Mason.ldquoWe wanted to give people of all ages the chance to get out of the house and speak to people about how they are getting on, to share positive things in their lives and help each other.The impact has been ldquoincredible, he adds. ldquoPeople have been helped to move on with their lives and go back into employment because their confidence has grown.ldquoSome of the first people who came to us are now with us as volunteers and helping others.ldquoWersquore giving people a reason to come out and get involved in their community, he adds.ldquoThey enjoy the peace and quiet and the chance to lose themselves in the act of growing something."},{"url":null,"title":"first-woman-climb-every-mountain-scotland-ireland-plans-final-ascent","story":"Her feet ached, she was cold, wet and had trouble walking for days afterwards.Once the discomfort passed however, the -year-old felt an incredible sense of achievement and a calmness that she found boosted her mood.It was that feeling of wellbeing that encouraged her to try again ... and again ... almost every month for the past  years.Next week she is set to become the first woman in the UK to have climbed all  mountains over ft in Scotland and Ireland, and will raise money for Scottish Mountain Rescue during her final trek.Grandmother-of-two Christine, from Carstairs, said: ldquoI never expected to have done so many walks but I just love it.ldquoI enjoy going with friends, but I also like being out on the hills on my own.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"dav\"  Residents urged to support Recycle Week viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While Be Reasonable Scotland is concerned this new law will turn ‘good’ parents into criminals.This is a concern I share. I have vivid memories of my mum walloping me as a mouthy teenager – but should she have been prosecuted  Absolutely not, she was a great mum, and will be mortiedshe reads this article.: Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking of children: Smacking laws in Scotland: current regulations, proposed changes and how the rest of the UK matches upBack in the s, hitting your kids was standard practice. Things have changed since then, as has language we use. We now talk about ‘smacking’ children, as opposed to hitting them just as we call those things we put our expensive cross-breed puppies in, crates instead of cages. It softens the blow, so to speak.Smacking our own kidsThe fact is, many of us have been driven to give our kids a smack at some point. According to a report by four leading Scottish children’s charities around % of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged three to seven the most likely to be on the receiving end.The numbers don’t surprise me. Nor do the ages of the children, as this is the time when parenting can be the most challenging. My son was three when I smacked him. Six years on, it still makes me shudder with regret.We were at the start of our holiday and had been travelling for around eight hours. I needed to change his nappy, but he wouldn’t let me. He wouldn’t stop shouting, he wouldn’t listen, he wouldn’t do a single thing I asked. So, in desperation, I smacked his very well padded bottom .And you know what  He stopped. Everything went quiet. And for a split second I felt relief. And victory. But then he turned to me and said ‘don’t you hit me’. Well, he did have a point… And then we both sobbed.A flash of furyThe essential problem with smacking or hitting your child is that it’s done in a moment of madness. It’s a flash of fury and frustration, when all other options have failed.This is what ‘time out’ was created for. It’s not just about punishing the child, it’s about giving the parent time to take a breath and calm their thoughts. There are countless times I have shut myself in the kitchen cupboard, so I can silently scream into the fridge, or bang my head against the cornflakes.I will do everything I can to avoid hitting my children because I know, in my gut, that violence is wrong. I tell me children on a daily basis not to hit each other, so how can I justy doing the same to them  We shouldn’t hit our children just because society or the law say it’s ok, or because they aren’t big enough to hit us back.In fact that is the very reason we shouldn’t hit them. Even when pushed to the limits by a tyrannical toddler, we don’t have the right to use physical violence. Just as those teachers back in the s had no right to hit our children.Many parents today look back on those times with disbelief and horror, and I wonder years from now our children will feel the same about those dark days when parents hit their children.Maybe this change in law marks the beginning of a new era of positive parenting.

The RNLI relies on donations to provide this training, to ensure that our leboat crew is as well prepared as they can be to help save lives at sea.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"construction firm ceases trading ","story":"Shetland Quality Construction Limited has ceased trading after entering into liquidation.The move to wind up SQC comes over a year after the company#s managing director, Ivor Smith, staged at protest at the official opening of the new Anderson High School.The event was attended by the Scottish government#s education secretary, John Swinney.Mr Smith claimed the company had been left almost £ million out of pocket for work done preparing the groundworks for the new school.At the time, Mr Smith said he was considering taking legal action against main contractor Morrison Construction.Morrison later said in a statement that SQC “failed to complete the works as contracted”.

When people have mental health problems or suicidal thoughts there is not enough being done for them. There’s still a lot stigma surrounding it. They feel that there’s nobody to talk to or that it makes them weak.

On Saturday the UUP Chairman questioned how any unionist could give their support to the Prime Ministers proposed deal.Read MoreUnionists want leaders to work together says Donaldson as UUP attack DUP over Brexit u-turnBoris Johnsons Brexit deal is threat to peace in Northern Ireland says former PM Tony BlairHow could any unionist support ghastly Brexit deal asks former UUP leader Lord Empey Time is tight - Leo Varadkar seeking Brexit meeting with Boris Johnson next weekHowever, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson rejected the criticism, saying the proposals will not create a trade barrier in the Irish Sea.\"It’s easy to sit on the sidelines and complain without offering a single realistic solution,\" the former UUP MLA said.Sir Jeffrey accused Lord Empey of \"fighting battles against the DUP which he lost fteen years ago\" and said that unionist voters want their leaders to work together.\"He should deal with his bitterness, focus on the policy rather than the person and move on,\" the DUP MP said.He said that the PMs deal \"removes the threat of the backstop and fully respects our constitutional position within the UK\". \"Sinn Fein and Dublin know it and that is why they have expressed their opposition to this deal with so much anger,\" the Lagan Valley MP said.After reading Sir Jeffreys comments Lord Empey issued a response of his own, saying that the DUP MP \"clearly doesnt understand what he has agreed to\".He said that government documents on the Brexit proposals state that Northern Ireland will be in a \"dferent regulatory area to Great Britain and we would be governed by laws over which we have no say\". Lord Empey said this establishes that Northern Ireland will have a \"special status\".The veteran politician said the proposal to give the Stormont Assembly a say over Northern Irelands relationship with the EU \"would make it a border poll every four years and destroy and chance of building normal politics here\".He also pointed to confusion over how the Stormont veto would work, saying the Secretary of State had been unclear over the precise arrangements. “This is reckless stuff. It is clear that this has not been thought through - we have had three suggestions in three days as to how this would be done,\" Lord Empey said.\"I cannot see how the EU would agree to this bright idea.

Larne becomes the point of entry as well as Newry. This is not what leave voters imagined in .\"The veteran unionist said that the current plan would stop Great Britain trading freely with Northern Ireland.\"This is the Achilles heel of his case and the total abandonment of all his partys promises over the last few years,\" Lord Empey said.“Smoke and mirrors wont be enough to get the DUP out of this mess. It’s a sad day when any unionist party envisages us being in a totally dferent regulatory zone from the rest of our country. \"This will lead to further calls for our economy to align with the Republics, and the complication and uncertainty of being in a zone where regulations are dferent on either side of the channel between us and Scotland, can only be a barrier to new investment.”Speaking earlier on Sunday Sir Jeffrey said that the UUP had achieved \"absolutely nothing\" in their past attempts to work with the Conservative Party.\"The DUP sought and won the commitment in the PM’s proposals for the prior and ongoing consent of the Executive and the Assembly to any regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,\" he said.The MP said that the UK as a whole is leaving the EU single market and that any remaining regulatory alignment with the EU would only apply to goods such as agri-food to appease Northern Irelands farmers and the business community.\"The DUP is absolutely clear that an all-Ireland economic zone, with all goods and services exclusively under EU rules, and the resulting regulatory border in the Irish Sea is not something we would support,\" Sir Jeffrey said.\"Nor will we support trade barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that is why this deal means Northern Ireland will remain firmly within the U.K. customs arrangements and outside the EU customs union.\"Sir Jeffrey said that it made sense for Northern Ireland to have distinct arrangements in cases like the Single Electricity Market which is \"economically beneficial\".He said that Mr Johnson recognised that the backstop \"risked weakening the Belfast Agreement\" and that consent from both nationalists and unionists would be needed to reach agreement.\"That of course remains our position.

To compare me, my fellow colleagues and comrades in Sinn Fein and our supporters to wild animals… I don’t think that is a comment worthy of the office of an Taoiseach.“I think that those remarks really trivialise and make light of what is a very serious job. In that regard, I do think it is warranted to compare him with Boris Johnson because that kind of cod acting and play acting and juvenile action should have no place at all,” she said.Fianna Fail TD Stephen Donnelly said Mr Varadkar was wrong to say his party were predatory.Fianna Fail are in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Fine Gael Party and have said they will maintain the arrangement to steer the country through Brexit negotiations.“He has got a whf of the Boris Johnson about him at the moment,” said Mr Donnelly.“We have the leader of the country not just having a go – which is fine but getting quite personal and quite nasty. That feels to me quite disingenuous when what we need to be doing right now is protecting the country.”"},{"url":null,"title":"woman in 80s forces burglars out of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable. This team has never put back-to-back championships and then all you have from everyone is that they are one-hit wonders, theyrsquoll get a championship this year, but sure next year itrsquoll not happen, he said.ldquoThey havenrsquot the heart for it, but they showed the heart they have. They are a serious team and there are some serious players in it. I think last year was a nervy final.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC. To date  UDR recruits have completed a four-week course at the camp.HORSE RACING mdash More than  entries have been received for the Ulster Cesarewich meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse on Saturday.The card produces another bumper programme, following on the heels of the successful August Bank meeting, and the entries have been split over six dferent races.The meeting again has had to depend on sponsorship, as the Downpatrick course continues to do what isnrsquot done anywhere  in the racing world mdash carry on racing without government support.Major William Brownlow, in his annual report recently, said that he was confident that racing would continue at Downpatrick mdash the second oldest course in Ireland mdash for at least another few years. It was dependent, of course on generous sponsorship, as the pound, grant from the government has been ended.He said the local tote would be continued, so that the profit could go back into the course.

With the leadership in the team it leaves me in no doubt they will give %, as always.Club PRO and coaching officer Gerard Lenaghan is also looking forward to Sundayrsquos showdown.ldquoI would like thank our management team and the players, especially for their dedication over the past nine months as we look forward to the final on Sunday with great anticipation, he said.ldquoThe squad has a good balance of experience and youth with an abundance of talent at their disposal. It would be remiss of me not to mention also our vibrant and hard-working executive committee who have taken a lot of the pressure off some of our footballers involved at committee level in the week to week running of the club.ldquoThe league success and now a first ever championship final is fitting reward for all our combined efforts both on and off the field.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9411974.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs Foster said the coverage was “ridiculous”.Referring to “Arlene ‘two borders’ Foster”, UUP chairman Lord Empey said that the DUP’s plan would exclude Northern Ireland from one of the benefits of Brexit – new trade deals “as we will remain in and governed by the rules of the EU single market and ruled by the EU Courts, another red line that the DUP has broken”.He added: “The long-term effects of these proposals will be to align the Northern Ireland economy to the Dublin economy and we will erge over time from the GB economy. Where, from a unionist perspective, does that lead us ”However, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson accused his former party colleague of “bitterness” and said the DUP had worked with Boris Johnson to secure “a reasonable offer”.He said: “The reaction in Dublin in itself undermines Lord Empey’s scaremongering and defeatism.This deal removes the threat of the backstop and fully respects our constitutional position within the UK.”He said that the whole UK would leave the single market and “any subsequent regulatory alignment with EU rules can only apply to goods such as agri-food because that is what our farmers and businesses have asked for”.However, former DUP MEP Jim Allister said the DUP had “surrendered on a principle central to our sovereignty” because the prime minister had made clear that all Northern Ireland goods would be subject to EU rules.The TUV leader said: “To think that the DUP has signed up to such is staggering. Not just does it breach their blood red line, but it sets us up for economic unity with the Republic and increasing ergence from GB.”Leo Varadkar criticised for comparing Sinn Fein to wolves Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIts official -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

He should resign.I immediately ed to Parliament to hold this appalling PM and Government to account, not only on Brexit but also on all the things that people care about ndash like pensions, benefits, sanctions, health, police, refugees, climate change, international trade, EU citizens, the middle east, fracking, Northern Ireland, sexual violence, child poverty ndash all the things that Johnson saw fit to put on hold to suit his own political ends.As I said in the emergency debate on Prorogation prior to the unlawful suspension of Parliament: ldquoMany constituents have told me they are not interested in the procedures and the chicanery they are interested in their lives, and what dference the proceedings here makes to them.My colleagues and I promised that despite the unlawful and unconstitutional delay to business, we would not be silenced ndash we have not been, and we WILL speak up for our constituents against this undemocratic government.As a Welsh Labour MP I will campaign for Remain in all circumstances.I will not support a Brexit that makes people poorer, less safe, takes away opportunities for our young people, or puts peace in Ireland and Northern Ireland at risk ndash and itrsquos only by co-operation that we can tackle the climate emergency.On that subject, it was wonderful to meet so many passionate young constituents from Penarth and Cardf at the Climate Strike rally outside the Senedd on Friday.They have my complete support! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The combined government, private and corporate debt is more than three times the countryrsquos GDP, the Bank of Portugal said.

traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by .

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said.
