Kathryn Hughes strips back the layers of this classic tale to understand its enduring appeal“The Yellow Wallpaper” by the American writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman created feminist fireworks the moment it appeared in the January 1892 edition of the New England Magazine. The short story takes the form of a secret diary written by a young married woman who is suffering from a “temporary nervous depression – a slight hysterical tendency”. Actually, the diagnosis has been made by her husband, who also happens to be “a physician of high standing”. In line with fashionable medical practice, “John” has prescribed a radical rest cure that involves separating the narrator from her small baby and confining her to the top-floor nursery of a rented country house: “I … am absolutely forbidden to ‘work’ until I am well again.”Gilman was writing out of her own agonising experience: five years earlier, and felled by postnatal depression following the birth of her daughter, she had been sent for treatment to America’s leading expert in women’s mental health, Dr Silas Weir Mitchell. His punishing regime for depressed middle-class female patients involved strict bed rest with no reading, writing, painting and, if it could be managed, thinking. His theory was grounded in the pervasive belief that if modern girls stopped wanting things – education, the vote but, above all, “work” – they would become happy, which is to say docile, again. Mitchell instructed Gilman to live as domestic a life as possible “and never to touch pen, brush or pencil as long as you live”. Gilman wrote later of her treatment, which felt more like a prison sentence, “I … came perilously close to losing my mind.”Which is exactly what happens to the narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper”, as she discovers that having “no congenial work, with excitement and change” leaves her ravenous imagination at the mercy of unnamed terrors. As her mood darkens, she starts to notice unsettling things about her room: there are bars at the windows, iron rings on the walls and her bed has been nailed to the ground. More oppressive still is the sulphurous yellow wallpaper with its weird smell and sinister pattern.It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide – plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of contradictions.It is at this point that the reader starts to wonder whether the narrator is to be trusted. Can it really be, as she is now suggesting, that her husband and his sister are acting, not as her caretakers, but as her jailers? And what about the figure of the woman whom she claims to have spotted creeping about under the noxious yellow paper? Are we to interpret this as a potent symbol of the narrator’s repressed creative desires, her psychic shadow? Or is she simply insane?The story’s “refusal to be reduced to a single interpretation is what makes it such a fertile work”, says Gail Marshall, professor of Victorian literature and culture at the University of Reading. Indeed, in the hundred plus years since its publication, these 6,000 words, which so convincingly skewer female oppression at the hands of the patriarchy, have mutated into endless new forms. “The Yellow Wallpaper” has been staged countless times both as a one-woman show and as an ensemble piece. It has lent itself to radio drama and has made it several times on to television, once even providing the plot for an episode of The Twilight Zone. There have been at least eight cinema versions, the most recent by Kourosh Ahari, which transferred the action to 1950s America.In the last three years, though, this seminal text has taken on a renewed urgency. “‘The Yellow Wallpaper’ speaks directly to our #MeToo moment,” Marshall says she points to the very particular kind of power that the husband in Gilman’s story seeks to exert. There is no crude physical violence in evidence here, not even a cross word. Instead what the narrator describes is a kind of psychological torture, in which her own sense of reality is constantly assaulted: “John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON to suffer, and that satisfies him.” Here, Marshall suggests, is a textbook account of what we have only recently come to recognise, let alone give a name to: “coercive control”. An older term for it might be “gaslighting”.In such a rich context, then, it’s no wonder that Gilman’s tiny masterpiece is busy morphing into vibrant new forms. On 22 February a show by the American Nigerian artist Kehinde Wiley opens at the William Morris Gallery in east London, consisting of a series of female portraits made explicitly in conversation with Gilman’s classic feminist text. At first glance Wiley, who became well known in 2018 when he painted Barack Obama’s portrait for the Smithsonian, might seem an unlikely fan of the story. The Yale-trained artist, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles, is best known for his hyperreal portraits of mostly working-class men and women of colour dressed in vibrant streetwear. His monumental figures gleam with health and confidence, a world away from the pale, neurasthenic Wasp-ish woman whom we picture as the narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper” – someone who looks a lot like Gilman in fact. For his new show, Wiley and his team went looking for female subjects in nearby Dalston. “The streetcasting went extremely well,” remembers the curator, Rowan Bain. “Women were invited back to the gallery to be photographed, and Kehinde worked from those images.” Yet the figures that will go on show are much more than character sketches drawn from contemporary streetlife. Wiley’s practice has always depended on self-consciously inserting his subjects into the formal traditions of European high art. This is swagger portraiture, done in the tradition of a Rococo master such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo or with the silky suggestiveness of a John Singer Sargent. The ornate gold frames resemble something a Medici might have ordered. And then there are the backgrounds. More often than not Wiley positions his figures, complete with tight black leggings, gigantic shades and Nike slogans, against a repeating floral trellis design reminiscent of a piece of classic William Morris wallpaper, saturated with the colours of West African ankara (prints). The point, Wiley suggests, is to bring together these clashing traditions as a way of thinking about the historical exclusion of certain kinds of bodies from the privileges of high art.“The question of race is hiding in plain sight in ‘The Yellow Wallpaper’,” Marshall argues. The tendency, ever since Gilman’s short story was rediscovered by second-wave feminists in the 1970s, has been to read it as the escape of a bourgeois white woman from the prison of the patriarchy. But look carefully, Marshall suggests, and you will see that something more complex is going on. The building in which the narrator is imprisoned is an old “colonial” mansion, dating from the age of slave-keeping in America. The shackles in the room hint at the violent physical restraint of black bodies. And it is not just one woman crawling under the wallpaper. By the end of the story the narrator has spotted “so many” women who she believes have scrabbled free from the garish yellow prison. “What we are looking at here is a powerful moment of women coming together to act collectively,” Marshall says.It is this resonance of Gilman’s writing to contemporary women’s lives that first caught the attention of Lindsey Mendick, a young artist and sculptor whose show The Yellow Wallpaper has just opened at Eastside Projects in Birmingham. “The moment I read Gilman’s short story, the parallels with my own experience felt uncanny,” Mendick says. At 18, felled by anxiety and depression “which no one knew how to help”, she dropped out of art school and retreated to a small bedroom in her parents’ house in north London. “I couldn’t do anything, but the less I did, the more ill I became. Each day a new terror would seize hold of me and I would ruminate obsessively.”Agoraphobic, insomniac and prey to constant panic attacks, Mendick’s mental health deteriorated to the point where she feared that she had begun to hallucinate. “One night I looked out of the window of my bedroom and saw six men in black with walkie talkies swarming around our cul de sac. It was terrifying, like the realisation of all my worst fears.” Mendick’s parents assumed this was simply the latest symptom of their daughter’s fragmented mental state, but a few days later, the news broke: the family’s neighbour had been the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, and he had been poisoned.Mendick’s new show sets her own chilling experience in conversation with that of Gilman’s narrator. “I wanted to explore a domestic gothic, the terror that can lurk within very familiar, homely objects.”There is yellow wallpaper here, but it is not the Arts and Crafts swirl described in the original story and even in Wiley’s rendition. Instead, these are stark mid-20th century geometric shapes that come to resemble the repetitive bars of a grid, a grille or a prison. Mendick’s family are referenced by a series of nesting Russian dolls, and Litvinenko’s story is there too, in the form of a tiny Putin head and some sinister looking sushi rolls (the poisoning of the Russian defector was thought to have taken place in a central London Japanese snack bar). In Mendick’s world, as in “The Yellow Wallpaper”, it is “those intimate, domestic, scaled-down spaces which are supposed to make you feel safe which turn out to be the most terrifying of all”.• Kehinde Wiley: The Yellow Wallpaper is at the William Morris Gallery, London E17 from 22 February.• Lindsey Mendick: The Yellow Wallpaper is at Eastside Projects in Birmingham until 11 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069b5252aff6e59514173bfc14bc85adfc437e5b/0_0_3618_2171/master/3618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcfd1ec61b2825f80120458a79f23ea8","title":"can the aviation industry really go carbon neutral by 2050","story":"Given the take-off in passenger numbers, critics have dubbed the Net Zero pledge as greenwash. It is plausible ... but only justLike all great pledges, it is just the right side of implausible. The UK aviation sector this week committed to making flying “net zero” by 2050, wiping out its carbon emissions despite taking more than 100 million extra passengers into the air each year.The steps certainly involve a leap of faith, in future fuels and aircraft technology, and human capacity to endlessly offset emissions. Just how does a growing industry plan to reduce its annual footprint from just over 36m tonnes of CO2 to net zero in three decades’ time?“We’re not going to be electrifying a London-Singapore A380 for a long time, if ever,” says Paul Stein, chief technology officer of aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce. “But sustainable fuels can work on the engines we have today, and the concept has been proved.”Creating the necessary volume is the tricky bit. Hopes have been pinned on new schemes, such as the new British Airways-backed plant to create jet fuel from household waste. Stein says Rolls-Royce has been exploring whether a small modular nuclear reactor could be used in a synthetic fuel plant, making hydrocarbons in a way that would reduce CO2 to balance the emissions produced in flight.“Right now we’re in analysis phase – understanding the economics … But what we’re going to see over the next 10 to 20 years is a lot of innovation and energy directed at creating sustainable aviation fuel.”Progress in coordinating European airspace and air traffic control has been slow. But with better use of airspace, and coordinated flight paths, planes could be guided more efficiently from take-off to landing. The UK is in the midst of redesigning its airspace to help create better paths. More efficient operations, such as eliminating stacking, would help aircraft carry and burn less fuel.Environmental groups question the adequacy of offsetting – but the roadmap relies on it to account for more than a third of aviation’s projected emissions. Jonathan Counsell, head of sustainability at British Airways’ owner IAG, says: “We think that we can get to net zero without it – but not by 2050. This is a transitional measure.” The scepticism about offsetting means, Counsell admits, that any schemes have to be high-quality, independently verified and end in actual, additional carbon removal. For now, offsetting means reforestation or restoration of peatland bogs that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere later, potentially, investment in new carbon capture and storage technologies.“We will have to pay more to fly,” says Holland-Kaye. Sustainable fuels are more expensive, and the carbon price is expected to rise tenfold, he says. The price of all the offsetting that the industry will rely on will be passed on to consumers through higher fares, constraining demand.So can this work? The industry urgently wants to present an alternative vision to the growing backlash against flying. Stein says: “Flying connects the world – it is a force for good in transporting people and goods, making sure our cultures have great levels of understanding.”As an engineer, he says, he is optimistic that emissions can be brought down sooner than the roadmap pledge: “We have the engineering tools to do it we need the will, and government help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e193bc1709aac568d82100b8247374af98c7365f/365_180_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44eb552f99aa62b94e92a2e60cb2a106","title":"shamima begum britain british ethnic minorities","story":"When British teenager Shamima Begum’s citizenship was revoked last February, the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, justified the response in the name of protecting national security. Married to an Islamic State militant eight years her senior and heavily pregnant with their third child at the time, it was difficult for many people to sympathise with Begum – who had left Britain in 2015 aged 15, along with two schoolfriends, to join Isis in Syria.She had further dismayed the public when, in her first interview after being discovered in a refugee camp, she remarked nonchalantly, “When I saw my first severed head it didn’t faze me at all.”Today, at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, Begum lost her appeal challenging the home secretary’s decision. The ruling will no doubt be popular – it’s difficult to have much sympathy with anyone who willingly signs up to the virulent misogyny and bloodlust of Isis. However, Begum’s banishment throws up two major questions.First, we need to know why a straight-A teenager from east London would willingly leave Britain to embrace a death cult. It defies all reason. Somehow this child was groomed and radicalised, not in some far-away country bereft of democracy, but here on British soil and without the knowledge of her parents. Before condemning her we need to know how this naive teenager was pushed in this direction. If she’d been sexually groomed at this age we would not be vilifying the victim.And, second, the British government’s decision to sever her citizenship is in effect burying its head in the sand. Though Bangladesh has washed its hands of her, Javid, and his successor Priti Patel, still claim Begum can apply for citizenship in that country, where her parents were born. But she’s a product of Britain, not of Bangladesh – a country she has never visited. Her rights as a British citizen – born here, raised here, and with an east London accent – should transcend the seriousness of her crime, and she should be tried on British soil. Doing otherwise sets a dangerous precedent.And, moreover, it sends a signal to all British ethnic minorities. Like many of us born here in families whose parents or grandparents migrated from abroad, Begum knows this country and no other. And until recently it’s only been the far right who have questioned black and brown people’s right to be here. But given that all ethnic minorities have family connections to other countries, it now places a question mark over all of our futures. Should we be convicted of a crime (and let’s face it, our communities are already heavily policed and there’s a long history of us being unfairly targeted by the criminal justice system), we may now face a double punishment – of deportation as well as the original sentencing.As a British citizen myself, of Pakistani descent, is it fair that my citizenship rights could be stripped if I committed a crime, that I could be banished to a country where I have no tangible connections other than the fact my grandparents migrated from there decades ago? More and more, the idea of “Britishness” seems to be squeezing out ethnic minorities, and especially our right to be who we are. We’ve had a decade of attacks on multiculturalism endless debate about “British values”, including a test announced by Javid in 2016 we’ve seen a rise in hate crimes since the Brexit referendum. And to cap it all, we’ve had the Windrush scandal, and the election as prime minister of a man who insults Muslim women and black people. A British identity inclusive of black, Asian and minority-ethnic communities is dying right before our eyes.When I was growing up, my grandparents who migrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s – when the far right National Front loomed daily – spoke ominously of returning to Pakistan before the British government kicked them out. They were the generation who shuddered as they listened to Enoch Powell lament that “in this country in 15 or 20 years time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man”.Begum’s crime (for which she has yet to be tried) is grievous indeed. However, with this verdict upheld, the government message is loud and clear: play by the rules, or risk having your citizenship revoked. It seems my grandparents weren’t as melodramatic as I thought after all.• Aina Khan is a writer and playwright and a former presenter for British Muslim TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce6ed075603cb6aacc27a8f7818c78d90ad69431/0_204_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880495d05d05653fd7a255ca54b11227","title":"climate activists bring trojan horse to british museum","story":"Activists dressed as warriors protest against corporate sponsorship deal with oil firmActivists have taken a Trojan horse into the grounds of the British Museum to protest against its sponsorship deal with the oil corporation BP.Protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors snuck their 13ft-tall wooden horse through a side gate at 7.30am on Friday and pulled it on to the forecourt in front of the museum’s entrance.The installation – based on the wooden horse in the ancient Greek myth of the siege of Troy – was timed to coincide with the museum’s latest exhibition, Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as “supported by BP”.“The Troy exhibition has inspired us to create this magnificent beast, because the Trojan horse is the perfect metaphor for BP sponsorship,” said Helen Glynn, an activist with the theatrical protest group BP or not BP?. “On its surface the sponsorship looks like a generous gift, but inside lurks death and destruction.”The activists have asked the museum to allow them to keep the wooden horse outside the front door until Saturday, when a bigger demonstration is planned.In a letter handed to the museum, they said: “Hundreds of people have helped to crowdfund this horse because they feel so strongly that the museum should not be promoting and giving legitimacy to an oil company when we are in the midst of a climate emergency.“The museum has previously said that it will facilitate peaceful protest and we want to work with you to make sure that our interactive artwork enhances tomorrow’s event.”The museum said it was awaiting advice from the police.Saturday’s protests, which organisers say will be one of the biggest so far in the campaign against big oil’s involvement in UK arts, will feature prominent voices from indigenous communities where BP has some of its operations.Raki Ap from the Free West Papua Campaign, who will attend the demonstration, said experts – including UN scientists at the IPCC – had recognised the key role indigenous communities play in the fight against ecological breakdown.“The most obvious solution to stopping climate change is to protect indigenous peoples and their rights, such as the Papuans in West Papua, where BP’s activities are actively destroying their living environment.”The protest is the latest move in activists’ campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship of the UK’s leading cultural institutions. In October, the Royal Shakespeare Company ditched its sponsorship deal with BP, after a campaign from artists, environmentalists and members of the public."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce.

It is our responsibility to help students understand and navigate all their choices,” Ucas said.“As this is a developing market, we listen to feedback from students and valued colleagues across the education and financial sectors, including Money Saving Expert, to ensure we provide students with appropriate choices, including those that are commercially available. Based on that feedback, we decided to pause our activity with private loans companies, and no further activity is currently planned.“With our new Ucas media advisory group, which we are currently recruiting to, we will continue to review this maturing market and further develop a set of principles to incorporate into our advertising framework.”Lewis praised the decision, saying: “When the Ucas chief executive agreed to meet me on this, we had a robust meeting, where I let them know in no uncertain terms what I thought about a charity – with a near-monopoly communication position with young students - promoting expensive high-cost debt to students.“The fact it has agreed to pause the adverts is a great start – and we are thankful Ucas’s senior team are willing to listen.”Ucas said half its income was generated by its commercial media subsidiary, which it uses to keep down application fees.

Testimony from Elizabeth Loftus, a cognitive psychologist, often helps undermine people who say they are victims.“It doesn’t take a PhD to know that memory fades over time,” Loftus told jurors in the New York supreme court.As memories fade, she said, people become more vulnerable to “post-event information” including media reports that can distort what they remember. They also can distort their own memories with inferences and guesses about past events.False memories “can be experienced with a great deal of detail, a great deal of emotion, even though they’re false”, she said. “The emotion is not a guarantee you’re dealing with an authentic memory.”Loftus, 75, took the witness stand a day after prosecutors rested their case. It featured more than two weeks of testimony, including the accounts of six women who say the once powerful Hollywood producer subjected them to vile sexual behavior.Weinstein’s lawyers are aiming to cement doubts about the women’s allegations after using cross-examination to highlight inconsistencies in some accounts. In some cases, the encounters the women recalled allegedly happened a decade or more ago.Weinstein’s lawyers have not said if he will testify. If he does, he could give prosecutors an opening to bring in more witnesses to rebut anything he says.“That is a question that does not have an answer at this point,” attorney Arthur Aidala said. “We want to see how our defense case goes.”Weinstein is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in March 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on a different woman in 2006. Weinstein, 67, has maintained any sexual encounters were consensual.Loftus was on the stand for about an hour, her testimony curtailed by a ruling barring her from testifying about memories specific to sexual interactions. She testified that she was not asked to evaluate any of the accusers or their testimony.Loftus is the co-author of the 1994 book The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegation of Sexual Abuse. In another book, Witness for the Defense, Loftus wrote that in her work for Bundy she seized on “leading and suggestive questions” by investigators and “hesitations and uncertainties on the part of the victim” as signs of muddled memories.On the stand on Friday, she sounded a similar note, telling jurors interactions with law enforcement “can lead people to want to produce details”.“Some can be accurate, and some can be false and inaccurate,” she said.When prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon asked if she was originally asked to be a defense consultant rather than a witness, Loftus said: “I don’t remember what I was asked exactly.”“Is that due to post-event information?” Illuzzi-Orbon quipped.Weinstein’s lawyers skipped plans to call the Hollywood writer and director Warren Leight, to testify about Annabella Sciorra’s drug use during a shoot in the early 1990s.Sciorra, now 59, testified that she was hooked on Valium when The Night We Never Met started shooting in late 1992, but denied defense suggestions she was still using it when she alleges Weinstein raped her in 1993 or 1994."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58fb7ab9a2c618ae59e56e96e9d763ba6bd818ca/0_102_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=618615538b811c2c94e871fa2d15d719","title":"oscars 2020 winners losers predictions peter bradshaw","story":"’s chief film critic makes his picks for the big night – can Bong Joon-ho pull it off with Parasite?Shoulda been a contender: Portrait of a Lady on FireWill win: Bong Joon-ho for Parasite.Should win: Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon a Time in HollywoodShoulda been a contender: Greta Gerwig for Little WomenWill win: Joaquin Phoenix for JokerShould win: Adam Driver for Marriage StoryShoulda been a contender: Eddie Murphy for Dolemite Is My NameWill win: Renée Zellweger for JudyShould win: Saoirse Ronan for Little WomenShoulda been a contender: Yong Mei for So Long, My SonWill win: Brad Pitt for Once Upon a Time in HollywoodShould win: Joe Pesci for The IrishmanShoulda been a contender: Robert Pattinson for The LighthouseShould win: Laura Dern for Marriage StoryShoulda been a contender: Tilda Swinton for The SouvenirShoulda been a contender: A Shaun the Sheep Movie: FarmageddonWill win: Steven Zaillian for The IrishmanShould win: Greta Gerwig for Little WomenShoulda been a contender: Edward Norton for Motherless BrooklynWill win: Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won for ParasiteShould win: Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon a Time in HollywoodShoulda been a contender: Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel and Katie Silberman for BooksmartWill win: Roger Deakins for 1917Should win: Roger Deakins for 1917Shoulda been a contender: Mike Gioulakis for Us"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/105ee85b07cf98516b7cce86f68cb5c2735f13b6/116_246_3398_2038/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761c0fadf232a546b8f07eed51b2d299","title":"stars urged to ditch the sequins at the oscars to save the oceans","story":"Although shiny on the red carpet they ‘hide serious socio-environmental impacts’Fashion insiders are warning the great and the good of Hollywood not to wear sequins on the Academy Awards red carpet, because of their terrible environmental impact.Last Sunday at the Baftas, despite guests being urged to opt for more planet-friendly fashion choices, Scarlett Johansson wore a sequinned pink Versace dress, Rebel Wilson was wrapped in a red sequin custom-made Prabal Gurung gown and Naomie Harris shone in silver sequinned Michael Kors. At the Grammys and Golden Globes last month, the red carpets were similarly awash with sequins.Awards season is an opportunity for stars to send a message. Sustainable fashion consultant Alice Wilby, would like to see a blanket ban on sequins and believes that if celebrities “really care about sustainability, they would stop wearing sequins on the red carpet.”They “are made from toxic, petroleum-based plastics which pollute our living planet and persist for hundreds of years,” according to Leigh McAlea of Traid. “Like the fashion industry itself, sequins may be shiny on the outside but they hide serious socio-environmental impacts”, she says.Sequins also come with issues around labour conditions and supply chain transparency, too. “Much ‘finishing’ work is done by hand,” according to McAlea, “and factories often subcontract to homeworkers, typically women and child labourers, who are easily exploited.”There are more sustainable versions available. According to Wilby, “recycled PET sequins and biodegradable options are being developed”. But, she says, “unless we instantly replace all plastic sequin production with biodegradable options, the eco-version will still be inspiring people to buy the cheaper plastic version.”While sequins on the high street might be more damaging in terms of scale, frequency of washing and life, sequins on the red carpet send a strong message. “The ‘Red Carpet’ is a powerful platform. Our clothes speak volumes about who we are and what we stand for”, advised the Baftas’ sustainable dressing guide last weekend.For Livia Firth, founder of Eco Age, a sustainable fashion consultancy that is challenging celebrities to dress more sustainably via its Green Carpet Challenge, says “Fashion has a huge power to change the world and it’s time for everyone to show how.”As for any difference between the red carpet incarnations and those that are mass-produced, Wilby says: “Wearing a couture gown embellished with sequins that have been sewn by a seamstress who is well paid and well treated is no excuse”, she says, citing the impact on the trend-cycle. “It creates the desire for a raft of cheap, imitation dresses, that will be worn a few times and then tossed. It’s time to stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07e2847918d001fe8e11af0aeec4dbd452727449/0_1455_5227_3136/master/5227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec82033d82c30fb6e99cf5a7a5f6f827","title":"cocktail of the week simon wood manchester appetite rocktail recipe","story":"Like a royal gin fizz, but with passion fruit and a colourful finishing flourish Music is a huge part of my life, and this “rocktail” is inspired by my favourite LP, Appetite for Destruction by Guns N’ Roses – it’s colourful, loud and proud, just like the album.

Is sourdough the only way to go? Should the ’shrooms be creamed or naked? And is a flat white the ultimate drink pairing?As recently chronicled in the , the mushroom is having a moment, and nowhere more so than in Antipodean-inspired brunch cafes, where meat is in retreat and avocados, eggs and sweetcorn fritters are in the ascendancy. Packed with beneficial nutrients and so sustainable you can grow them in spent coffee grounds (creating a virtuous breakfast circle), mushrooms are set to play an ever bigger part in our mornings.Like the bacon sandwich or boiled egg, mushrooms on toast is a dish of such seeming simplicity you may wonder how it warrants How to Eat’s attention. How will it support 1,500 words of painfully verbose, serio-comic riffing? But at How to Eat the deliciousness is in the detail. For instance, two plain, baked flat mushrooms on Warburton’s toastie loaf is, technically, mushrooms on toast. But is that the dish that celebrity fans such as Nigel Slater, Timothy Spall and Victoria Coren fell in love with? It is certainly not a plate you would happily pay £7 for in your local hipster café (after drone yoga, Weds 7.30am). Not without asking: “Oi, tattoos, where’s the rest of it?”So, without further ado, it is time for How to Eat (HTE) to put the fun in fungi and adjudicate on mushrooms on toast.Disclaimer: much as HTE loves the picture of Britain painted in this American article, of a nation of Siobhans habitually foraging their own mushrooms, please don’t. It will likely be a waste of time in built-up Bolton or Birmingham (pro tip: try the supermarket), or you may die. Eight years in, HTE cannot afford to lose any more readers. We are barely quorate here as it is.The meatier the mushrooms, the mightier the dish that is, both meaty in texture and in their bosky woodland flavours. They have their uses elsewhere, but in this case avoid mushrooms that can take on a flabby, chewy consistency, such as oyster, hen of the woods, girolles and shimeji. Instead, use stocky, muscular varieties such as chestnut or shiitake, bulked out if necessary with field or cup, and, perhaps, given a given a bit of extra bottom-end weight in the bass cabinets (note: it is often useful to think of a dish as a dub reggae soundsystem), by adding a few dried, rehydrated wild porcini.Chop everything into broadly uniform bite-sized chunks. You do not want a jumble of mushrooms ranging from minuscule to XXL pieces you struggle to manoeuvre into your mouth. Cook with care so that, beyond their silky surfaces, those earthy mushrooms retain a toothsome bite.To be precise, this entry should be titled creamed mushrooms on toast. You can fry your mushrooms in A Fat of Your Choosing (it should be butter and plenty of it) and simply plonk them on toast, but why deny yourself the pleasure of also enrobing them in something creamy? Preferably, half-fat creme fraiche, as its lactic twang is useful as we build flavour into this dish.Adding cream of some sort also helps overcome a major issue: during frying, mushrooms disgorge so much water you will struggle to drive it off. Served naked, wet mushrooms will create an unedifying damp patch in the middle of your toast. The addition of creme fraiche, however, seems to hold the sauce atop the toast for longer, slowing the rate of absorbency, preventing the bread from turning into a rank wet mulch. How does that work, you ask? Let’s call it an emulsion-cum-viscosity-type-thing-maybe. If you came here for hard science, you are reading the wrong column.In terms of additional flavourings, garlic is key, shallots or onion less so. You can crush, smoosh and generally obliterate the former into a melting paste, but, no matter how finely chopped, onions bring an itty-bitty texture to the dish that detracts from its velvet smoothness (see also, bacon shrapnel, pine nuts, chopped chives etc). For extra umami impact andor general interest, you should also vigorously reduce a splash of soy sauce, dry Marsala or other wine in your mushrooms. HTE’s preference is for soy early doors, then a squeeze of lemon just before serving to give it some top-line zip.Grated cheese is more tempting but similarly inessential. Deploy your soy efficiently and you will not need a sprinklingavalanche of parmesan or cheddar to ramp up this dish’s umami levels. In fact, go too heavy on the cheese and your ’shrooms will turn into a greasy quagmire.Adding an egg creates a similar issue. Yolk running in creamy sauce is not the sublime diary duet it appears on paper. It turns your hillock of creamed mushrooms into an overly thickened mess, while the egg white turns this already rich dish into something that eats like a precursor to gout.You could add a green side salad to make yourself feel virtuous but it will taste disgusting. Is there anything more dispiriting in food than eating iron-packed, chlorophyll-stacked leaves that have wilted in a hot, creamy sauce? It is a truly jarring experience. Like Thom Yorke supporting Taylor Swift, a misplaced Manchester City pass, Paddy McGuinness fronting Newsnight.Adding anything more substantial or radical to mushrooms on toast (please click past suggestions such as goat’s cheese, crab meat, prosciutto or leeks), turns this into an irreconcilably different animal. The only thing worse would be dressing your plate with that Brian Blessed of condiments, truffle oil. No matter how little you use, it shouts down every other flavour. Less a finishing flourish, more aerial bombardment.Take two inch-thick slices from the middle of a circular off-white sourdough boule and after toasting them to a Mediterranean tan, arrange them in a crossed V-shape*, one on top of the other. That way, you can drape your mushrooms over the “joint” in that V and ensure that a section of the bottom piece of toast remains dry. This is the section, along with the indestructibly robust crusts, that you can then use to mop up any remnants of sauce or stray mushrooms. It is the best of both worlds: the generously buttered toast will be gently softened by the creamy sauce yet, elsewhere, will remain dry enough that you can taste its lightly sour, long-fermented complexity.You could try other breads. You could try ones that appear to make sense, such as ciabatta or English muffins (too woolly, too absorbent, ultimately). If you really hate yourself, you could also try those that don’t, too (dark rye, worthy wholemeal, supermarket white sliced that will drown and disintegrate beneath those mushrooms). But with the exception of Simon Hopkinson’s beloved fried bread – worth trying, but just too much, frankly – you will always come back to sourdough.* Please invert the V so its apex is facing away from you as you eat. Only a monster would eat food that is pointing aggressively at them. And why have you made your food so angry? Because you are eating it upside down.A flat plate with a low lip to retain the sauce, but nothing deeper or curved that exists in that growing grey zone where bowls meet plates. You need a proper flat surface to work on, one that in no way inhibits your movements with a knife and fork. Put the kitchen roll on the table, too. Let’s go all out. This is a saucy dish. It can get messy.Historically, mushrooms on toast was regularly described as the ultimate “light supper”, that middle-class meal eaten mid-evening (in lieu of a proper tea, the bohemian layabouts) that baffled working-class northerners who, by that hour, had already eaten their supper – cornflakes in front of Coronation Street. But now we all work and eat at increasingly irregular hours and that confusion no longer opens up the seam of comic gold it once did. The light supper is toast. Eating a main(ish) meal at 8pm (or 4pm or 10pm) has been normalised.That is good news for mushrooms on toast, because other than before 9am, when a deeply savoury version can be a bit over-facing, it works at any time. It is big enough to fill any hunger gap, but not so heavy it will leave you prone and groaning. Quite the opposite. It is a relatively easily digestible livener. As a fan of the savoury course, HTE also recommends it as dessert, albeit in a half-size version.I know this is Britain. I know this is How to Eat. But, hey guys, we don’t have to drink alcohol with every meal, right? Because in a very satisfying case of serendipity, vis-a-vis the Oz-style brunch cafe, the flat white is the perfect partner for mushrooms on toast. In a Venn diagram they would overlap in their creaminess, but then the coffee’s smoothly modulated bitterness clears the palate of any overbearing greasiness. It’s perfection. For 20 minutes. Then you can go for a pint.So, mushrooms on toast, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a8628bffee220cd7ab1cb22c80b4020acad088/0_192_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e97a12311612ceb6e42974cb2e92301","title":"george best manchester united six goals northampton fa cup 1970","story":"The meticulousness with which even the lowliest football clubs prepare for matches these days makes Northampton’s meeting the day before their FA Cup fifth-round game against Manchester United 50 years ago seem endearingly quaint. Convening in the County Ground boardroom for sherry, the fourth ision side’s players were on a promise of a £15-a-man bonus if they could beat their top-flight opponents. Hopeful of an upset, they settled down to be briefed by the club’s scouting department, an elderly local gentleman who had gone to watch United’s most recent match.Facing players of the calibre of Paddy Crerand, Bobby Charlton and Brian Kidd the prognosis was bleak, he told them, but if they could “nobble” Charlton they might have a chance. Sadly, Northampton’s reconnaissance man failed to mention that a 23-year-old by the name of George Best would probably be lining up against them, as the Ballon d’Or and European Cup winner had been serving a month-long ban when the scouting mission was carried out. It would prove, with the benefit of hindsight, quite the oversight.Some weeks previously, Best had incurred the wrath of the Football Association for kicking the ball out of referee Jack Taylor’s hands at the end of a League Cup match against Manchester City and been suspended for a month. It was a punishment the mercurial midfielder deemed excessive and attributed to the FA’s disapproval of his playboy lifestyle. He was further peeved by mutterings that during a subsequent five-match unbeaten streak, Manchester United were much improved in his absence.“While I’ve been suspended I’ve had letters from cranks saying that the team played better without me,” he said. “I felt if we were beaten by Northampton, people would say it was my fault.”Despite struggling against their lowly rivals for the first 20 minutes of the game played on 7 February 1970, United ran out 8-2 winners. Best, on a mission to prove his detractors wrong, chipped in with the winning margin of six goals. “I don’t really class myself as a footballer,” he said in the aftermath of the game. “I call myself an entertainer. I know a lot of people have paid to see me do something spectacular and that’s what I was trying to do on Saturday. It’s my job to do something that will send people away feeling that they’d like to see me play again.”And how. Putting his heroics into context in the following Monday’s , Albert Barham revealed that Best was the fourth player to score six in an FA Cup match. His double hat-trick wasn’t even a record, he noted, as Bill Minter had scored seven for St Albans against Dulwich Hamlet in the fourth qualifying round in 1922 – and still finished on the losing side. A little under two years later, Ted MacDougall would eclipse these feats by scoring nine for Bournemouth in an 11-0 first-round win over Margate.In the Observer the day after United’s win, John Heilpern had been effusive in his praise for Best. “His unique contribution made the suggestion that United play better without him look simply insane,” he wrote. “To have seen Best score those six goals is to have seen genius.”A capacity crowd of 21,711 was wedged into Northampton’s three-sided stadium, but few had a better view of their team’s main tormentor than Kim Book, the Northampton goalkeeper. “I have to hold my hand up for two of the goals but the rest were brilliant,” he later conceded. “When the fourth went in I thought we might just have our backs to the wall. They were a tremendous side. We all felt it was just an honour to be on the same park.” Book, the brother of Manchester City’s captain, Tony, had received a pre-match call from his sibling. “If you haven’t got anyone who can take care of George, you might have a bit of a problem,” he was advised.On match day, the sun was out but the County Ground was a quagmire, with the pitch markings practically indiscernible and barely a blade of grass to be seen. Best, unfazed by the uneven terrain on which he was forced to work his magic, at times seemed to glide above it as he set about almost single-handedly dismantling the Cobblers.His opener was a gift, Book letting a Kidd cross from the right sail over his outstretched arms and leaving United’s No 7 with a straightforward back-post header towards the Hotel End. Latching on to a through ball from Crerand, the faintest of touches took him past Book before he fired a low diagonal shot into the corner for his second. Kidd, who scored United’s other two goals, turned provider again for goal number three, with Book weakly palming his cross into the path of Best, who roofed it at the second attempt despite the best efforts of three defenders attempting to block its path from six yards. No longer bothering to celebrate, he converted another Kidd cross after getting in front of his man to skim a deft near-post header home for his fourth.Northampton, 5-0 down after Kidd added to United’s tally by stabbing home from a corner, decided to implement their original gameplan by nobbling Charlton, who was forced off with an injury and replaced by Francis Burns. Joining his muddied colleagues, the substitute cut a decidedly incongruous figure in his pristine red and white kit as, with his first touch, he sent Best haring through the middle past two defenders before slotting his fifth and United’s sixth past the increasingly forlorn Book.An exchange of goals – Kidd’s second and a consolation for Northampton’s Dixie McNeill – preceded the pick of Best’s half-dozen. Collecting a pass from Crerand on the edge of the penalty area, he ghosted past a defender with a little feint and left Book on his backside gazing in admiration as he ked home his sixth from a couple of yards. Exhausted, he leaned against the adjacent upright for support as the home crowd acknowledged his genius.“I remember thinking George was going to go one way but he dropped his shoulder and went the other and by then I was already on the deck,” Book recalled. “He was just too good for me.” A subsequent Frank Large header doubled Northampton’s tally.Northampton’s chairman, a local pharmacist by the name of Eric Northover, was not as magnanimous as his players or the home crowd. “It was disgraceful,” he fumed. “To lose 8-2 on your own ground is unforgivable. Six of the Best? I would call them six of the easiest.” In the immediate aftermath of a performance that would earn Best an invitation to 10 Downing Street from the prime minister, Harold Wilson, Best and Crerand adjourned to the Northampton dressing room to commiserate with their traumatised opponents. “They sat down with us and George said: ‘Don’t worry about it, mate. There wasn’t much you could do.’ He was a gentleman,” Book recalled. Floating above a Northampton bog on a February afternoon a half-century ago, there was little or nothing George Best could not do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23bed199ce0c6332c62821e77cb77ee9787a3b46/19_0_1617_970/master/1617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c26792cae8871d656c116b890a31306","title":"romesh ranganathan sri lankan food finally cool dont tell my mum","story":"She’s the Thierry Henry of Sri Lankan cooking – a hipster hopper can’t competeThe other night I went to a Sri Lankan restaurant in London (Paradise – not my review, the name). I have eaten more than my fair share of Sri Lankan food, growing up with a mum who is not only the Thierry Henry of Sri Lankan cooking, but also sees a fat son as the best way of marketing her brand.Sri Lankan food is nothing like Indian: it is hotter, drier, has a different array of flavours, and distinct staples, like hoppers (a bowl-shaped crispy pancake made from fermented rice flour) and coconut sambol (coconut made physically addictive). It hasn’t been taken to the heart of British culture in the same way Indian food has. Many people seem not to realise that they are different cuisines. One of my first standup routines was about the frustrations of going to an Indian restaurant with white friends and being asked for recommendations about a cuisine I had no more understanding of than they did. (The punchline was: “Why don’t you tell me what you know about tortellini, you prick” – sophisticated stuff.)I have also eaten at a lot of Sri Lankan restaurants, mainly with my parents. But these have been aimed at Sri Lankans. They are filled with tables that look as if they were stolen from a garden centre, and the vibe is very “school canteen”. You go in, order food from a guy who makes you feel as if you have insulted his family, then a while later you are delivered the most beautifully authentic Sri Lankan cuisine for a measly price. I love these places.At Paradise, however, I was faced with a new experience. The dishes were all things I have eaten by the bucketload throughout my life, albeit with a contemporary twist, and I felt proud to see them being enjoyed by almost exclusively non-Sri Lankans in a very trendy-looking venue.It wasn’t all pie-eyed euphoria, though. I have to confess I find the trend of walk-in-only restaurants extremely hostile to the greedier diner. When I eat out, I like to know what time we are going to be sitting down so I can push my hunger to its limit. I can only do this with close friends and family, because me eating when very hungry is one of the great visual atrocities of the modern age.If I am with people outside the inner circle, I normally eat before I get there. That way, I am less grabby when the food arrives, and people leave thinking I’m a polite, elegant diner, while in reality I am a greedy bastard who is tucking into his second dinner. When I get to a restaurant and they tell me a table will be ready in 40 minutes, it’s as much as I can do not to lock the door, declare the other diners hostage, and make my first demand the immediate delivery of an aubergine curry. In fairness to Paradise, they said it would be a 20-minute wait, but by then I’d already loaded my gun.I had to tell my mum about my discovery. I thought she might be excited about the prospect of top-quality Sri Lankan scran being served to the trendies of Soho. Later that day, she popped round to say that she had looked at the menu, and it didn’t look that great. She also warned me that aubergine curry can be quite unhealthy, because of the frying, oblivious to the fact that she makes tankers of it for me. I realised then that I had made a fundamental error. I promised to take her soon, and this time I will remember to tell her that, while the food is nice, it’s not anywhere near as good as she makes it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90e807f9da73d4c8fff3408ce758e4a7c379634/438_780_4834_2901/master/4834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c54e86517ceea43f4705d718c4b1a168","title":"springs loaded test driving nikes new vaporfly running shoe","story":"Would the brand’s claim to make plodders into joggers stand up at the Burgess Park parkrun?“If you hear the sound barrier being broken over Burgess Park,” I said to my flatmate as I left the house, “that will be me.”I was joking, sort of. Ahead of me, the 5km local parkrun. Beneath me, or at least on my feet, a new pair of Nike Vaporflys – the most talked-about trainers in the world.So much spring has been put into so many steps by these shoes, it has been branded “technological doping” by some in the world of athletics.Looking at the science before heading out, it seemed that these trainers were higher-tech than the Toyota Starlet in which I learned to drive – and quite possibly faster.Even the design, in a very precisely calibrated turquoise and tangerine, makes it look as though your feet are sliding outwards off your legs.Elite runners don’t need convincing. Of the 36 possible podium finishes in world marathon majors in 2017, 19 were wearing Vaporflys.But none of those medallist marathoners are likely to have pounded the paths of Burgess parkrun in Southwark, south LondonSo, could the Nike lab magic work on me?The US runner Jacob Riley had it exactly right when he said Vaporflys felt “like trampolines” my old Adidas trainers felt like spa slippers by comparison.That always happens with new running shoes: like getting fitted for a bra, you wonder how you ever managed to muddle on with the old ones for so long. But it was immediately obvious that the Vaporflys were different.It was as if springs were shooting out from under my feet, bouncing me along Inspector Gadget-style. They felt simultaneously weightless and like mattresses had been lashed to my soles.I typically complete the 5km course in 28 minutes, give or take 30 seconds. But since the new year the Burgess parkrun has attracted record-breaking numbers, with more than 800 runners jostling to get around.Bottlenecks at the start and finish had slowed me down and there was little my trainers could do about that. So my expectations were low. When my results came, I was flabbergasted: 26 minutes, 18 seconds – one second off an entire minute faster than my fastest-ever.My previous personal bests had all been hard-won in incremental, 30-second improvements. This was a monumental advance.The Vaporflys undeniably work. I am not sure why I thought they wouldn’t. And therein lies the problem: I couldn’t feel proud of my achievement. If a personal best is simply a matter of money, does it really count?For the average parkrunner, motivated less by speed than reducing the risk of early death, £250 for a pair of trainers is a lot of money – even if you shave a minute off your personal best.And these are not shoes for your average daily jog-about – Nike markets them as “for race days”, a nod to their relatively limited mileage.But with a half-marathon looming, it is reassuring to know that I have time, and tech, on my side – whether deserved or not.As of last week, I’m with the person who replied: “You sound slow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b5017be6c33a1a27bb4ec2d0dd1ac64e27db18/0_66_2378_1427/master/2378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9bd01f190ca065647c257b70948fe13","title":"how we stay together we dont waste precious time with sulking and the silent treatment","story":"One time punks Sarah Munn and David Swain have kept their shared spirit of rebellion – even though their lives look much different todayNames: Sarah Munn and David SwainYears together: 38Occupations: Manager and chefIf you’d told Sarah Munn and David Swain years ago that they’d end up in somewhat conventional gender roles, they’d have laughed.When they met in the 80s, the twenty-somethings from Adelaide were would-be punks: he had a mohawk and a Vespa while she channeled Annabella Lwin from Bow Wow Wow. Both were passionate about politics, the environment and art, and could be found handing out how to vote cards for the Nuclear Disarmament party and dancing to the Clash at raucous parties.Yet now, in their fifties, while their values haven’t changed, they’ve found that what works for their family looks rather traditional. Sarah runs their home in Aldinga Beach, South Australia, and did most of the hands-on parenting of their two sons, while David works and spends time gardening. He does do most of the cooking, unusual for a professional chef, but he gets as much enjoyment out of preparing food at home as he does at work. And while they’ve always valued gender equality, they both find it amusing the way things have turned out. “It’s like oh my god we’re just really traditional people,” Sarah laughs.They never bothered to get married though. “Marriage and weddings never sat with our atheist, feminist beliefs,” says Sarah. “Some people expected that we would get married when we had children but it has never been on the agenda for us. I think that we both enjoy the statement that not being married makes … It appeals to our inner punk and desire to not conform.”After a few months, the couple moved into a share house together with another couple. “We were still part of a family of all different people, so we were together but there were always a lot of distractions, there was always a party happening, and we were experimenting in lots of different ways.” Those early years were a “messy” time for the couple, with recreational drug use and the occasional indiscretion, but something kept them connected.The turning point came when David moved to London and then, a few months later, Sarah joined him. “It solidified our relationship because it was obvious to both of us that we hated being apart. Even though we were off having a good time independently and it was probably good for us, I feel that when we came together again, we were very clear that we weren’t going to be going anywhere else.” Reunited, they travelled together and worked in London before returning home.They’d both been working in hospitality. Sarah, who was training to be a dancer, worked as a waitress while David was working in kitchens. When they arrived in Melbourne, David started to get serious about his chef aspirations, working at top restaurants like the Melbourne Wine Room and Veludo.David made sure she knew he would never be unfaithful: “I made that decision early on when we were in Melbourne, knowing the hospitality crew and everything that happens in hospitality, to have Sarah at home looking after the boys, she deserved to know she had absolute trust in me. I always made it clear that if I came home at two or three in the morning, she could feel confident that there was nothing going on.” The long hours and demands of David’s job prompted the pair to find a better work-life balance. The family moved to South Australia’s Fleurieu Peninsula, where David set up his own restaurant, Fino, with business partner Sharon Romeo and, a few years later, with Sarah. They designed the restaurant’s hours so that David would only work a few nights a week. “It was a completely different work relationship with a family and that’s what we strove for, to get that balance so I wouldn’t miss the boys growing up.”Both boys are adults now, something the couple are excited about. “We officially don’t have teenagers anymore and that was an amazing revelation … the idea of being empty nesters,” says Sarah. “We still really like each other and it’s a whole other phase of life which we’re looking forward to.”That friendship is at the core of their relationship. “I’ve always felt that,” says David. “I would be lost without Sarah in so many ways because I speak about everything I have on my mind to Sarah and always have. That’s one of the lovely things I know we can do together, talk about anything we want to without any prejudice from the other.”Over the years, their approach to conflict has evolved. “We don’t like conflict,” they both say quickly when asked – but they’ve learnt not to ignore it. “We address issues as soon as they emerge,” says Sarah. “I used to be a silent treatment type of person, I wouldn’t speak for a day and thankfully I have learnt that that is not a great way to go about things. It is better to not waste a day sulking but to get on with it.”That’s something they’ve also learnt working together, where it’s important to tackle issues quickly. Running the business together means they have to maintain boundaries between home and work.They regularly spend time outdoors to unwind, taking long walks on the beach not far from where they live. It’s an opportunity for solitude – together. “Because of the work we do, it’s a people business,” says Sarah, “you’re always talking to people, you’re always engaging, you’re always on. For us, we balance that by being in nature.”Although they don’t often articulate it, after all these years, their bond is strong. “We trust each other so deeply that I think that’s what forms the real foundation of our commitment,” says Sarah.• We want to hear your stories about staying together.

Most critics of the cable news network will be well aware of that, but in this case the admission is coming from Fox News itself.An internal research briefing obtained by the Daily Beast names four regular contributors to the network for peddling “disinformation”, particularly when it comes to the Ukraine scandal that led to Donald Trump’s impeachment.Among those named in the lengthy document titled Ukraine, Disinformation, \u0026amp the Trump Administration, put together by Fox News senior political affairs specialist Bryan S Murphy, are frequent guests Rudy Giuliani, John Solomon, Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova.Solomon, a disgraced former writer for the Hill and a regular guest of Sean Hannity’s, comes under particular scrutiny. “John Solomon played an indispensable role in the collection and domestic publication of elements of this disinformation campaign,” the document explains.Much of Solomon’s “reporting” on Ukraine formed the basis of Giuliani and other Trump officials’ efforts to smear and oust the former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a figure seen as standing in the way of the president and former Ukraine officials’ shadowy machinations in the country.Among the allegations against Solomon noted are “non-disclosure of conflicts, use of unreliable sources, publishing false and misleading stories, misrepresentation of sources, and opaque coordination with involved parties”.Elsewhere in the file obtained by the Beast are details of Giuliani and his back-channel dealings to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as his connections to now indicted figures Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Giuliani has a “high susceptibility to disinformation”, Murphy writes.The credibility of Toensing and diGenova, a married couple of hyperpartisan Trump loyalists who were secretly working for the indicted Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash during the period of their regular appearances on Fox News, is also called into question as they did not disclose that relationship.“Notable are the roles of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing in spreading disinformation and their parroting of beneficial narratives while employed by Firtash,” it explains.Hannity, the popular primetime host and Trump confidant, is also criticized for laundering the reputations and trumpeting the trustworthiness of the guests in question.According to Media Matters, the four iniduals have made 348 appearances on Fox News weekday programs since 2018. About 203 of them were on Hannity’s program alone.In a statement from Fox News, Mitch Kweit, senior vice-president of the Brainroom, said the research briefing was “being taken out of context and politicized to damage the network”.Kweit added: “The Ukraine briefing book is nothing more than a comprehensive chronological account of what every person involved in the Ukraine controversy was doing at any identifiable point in time, including tracking media appearances of major players who appeared on Fox News and in many other outlets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c57e9d997c595da78d62d43689aeb591e8895a74/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d3659381b9cabd4f26602884b29e4ce","title":"lets move to ilkley west yorkshire","story":"It’s like a miniature Harrogate, with smartly painted Victorian townhouses, Bettys and a beautiful lidoWhat’s going for it?

Its free distribution model means that it has high fixed costs, which cannot be offset with price rises. At the same time the outlet is facing the challenge of 4G mobile phone signal coming to the London Underground, giving readers an alternative to reading a print newspaper.The company has been pushing investment in its website while having to make job cuts and several long-serving staff members have departed.A key issue facing the Evening Standard is the role of its owner, the Russian businessman Evgeny Lebedev, and his willingness to subsidise the operation. The company’s accounts say the losses mean the outlet “requires continuous financial support from the shareholders”.A minority stake in the Evening Standard’s parent company was bought at the end of December 2017 by an offshore Cayman Islands company that turned out to be ultimately controlled by a Saudi Arabian state bank.This led to a failed attempt by the British government to investigate what they termed “unconventional, complex and clandestine” deals to enable Saudi investment in the Evening Standard and the Independent, a sister title. also revealed that Lebedev has hosted a private dinner for Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman.The newspaper groups eventually won the court case on the basis that the British government did not have the legal right to intervene."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e713c85e14b66188706f731ebc5b1df26334a1fe/36_546_2984_1791/master/2984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0df965737b5a82cbe0d0ad34f739b3c","title":"labours canvassing strategy had major deficiencies leaked report says","story":"Opportunity to increase vote share in marginals was missed due to ineffective grassroots operation, analysis showsA damning internal report into Labour’s on-the-ground election campaign has revealed activists did not have enough campaign material, were poorly prepared to talk about policy on the doorstep and did not target the right marginal seats.The leaked analysis by a Labour staffer, produced for senior party figures, found that officials were not in the right parts of the country to run an effective strategy, despite the fact that door-to-door campaigning increases turnout for Labour.And though Labour is the largest political party in Europe, the report – seen by the  – suggests it needs to expand its membership even further if it is to swing decisive seats in future elections.“Discussions with activists reveal … major deficiencies in the running of the campaign,” the report reveals. “These include poor quality and late delivery of printed materials, lack of communication and preparation over key policy lines, lack of clarity on how campaigns could secure the data of newly registered voters, the unreliability of digital tools, and inadequate training of activists.“Therefore there is clearly major room for improvement in the effectiveness of on-the-ground campaigning.”A Labour source said: “What this report shows is that canvassing does work and it does help but the party was not really well organised and there were basic deficiencies that activists weren’t getting data and there should have been different approaches to conversations at different points in the campaign. But there is statistical proof that canvassing works.”The report is one of a number of critical election postmortems for the Labour party, which returned its worst result since 1935.So far an analysis presented to the party’s National Executive Committee found that the poor election performance was down to the party leadership’s decision to back a second Brexit referendum and that too many policies were released on a daily basis throughout the election period.It did not blame the leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who they suggested had been the victim of unrelenting attacks on his character.Organisation Labour Together – which is being backed by the party’s former leader Ed Miliband and the Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell – has so far had feedback from 8,000 people. Early findings showed that voters did not like the party’s policies, and that the campaign was inefficient and beset with technical difficulties.However, this fresh report seen by the  is the first statistical analysis of how conversations with voters correlated to vote share for the party in inidual seats.As party members dissect the election result, activists who went door-to-door are keen for the role of canvassing to be recognised by the party centrally as a powerful way to secure votes and that it should be improved in time for the next election.They suggest more work needs to be done on the types of conversations to have with voters at different stages of the campaign. There were complaints that in some seats there was only a “voter ID” stage, which is when activists go house to house to gather if anyone might be a Labour supporter. Instead there needed to be more focus on the “get the vote out” phase and countering opponents’ attack lines.A Labour party spokesman said: “The National Executive Committee is collecting evidence from all teams and sections of the party for a detailed review of our election campaign and the result.“We are committed to learning the lessons when that review is complete.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a90f0d6b2a794e1eea98dc37a64445fb4929f0/32_341_2844_1706/master/2844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee66fde152dd70d5b89ea108a102d26","title":"mary lou mcdonald sinn fein leader kingmaker ireland election ireland","story":"The 50-year-old is leading a remarkable turnaround that has wrongfooted Ireland’s two-party establishmentDuring a lifetime of hearing it played and cited too many times, Mary Lou McDonald has come to loathe the Ricky Nelson song Hello Mary Lou and its cheery declaration of love for the girl who flashes “big brown eyes”.Hello, Mary Lou,Goodbye heart.Sweet Mary Lou,I’m so in love with youThe Sinn Féin leader had better brace herself, because after Ireland’s general election on Saturday, the media and her party colleagues may well barrack her with the lyrics, channelling them into headlines and belting them out at rallies.Commentators are calling it historic, a breakthrough for the republican movement that could realign Irish politics after a century of domination by two centrist parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.The IRA slogan “tiocfaidh ár lá” means “our day will come”, but not even Sinn Féin – the terrorism group’s political wing during the Troubles – anticipated the surge. It has captured a mood for change and wrongfooted Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil.At the core stands McDonald, 50, the personable Dubliner who succeeded Gerry Adams and may turn Sinn Féin into a party of government. As one wag put it in a letter to the : “Have Leo and Micheál met their Mary Lou?”In Cabra, a working-class area of McDonald’s Dublin Central constituency, many root for her to shake up what they consider an an ossified party duopoly past its expiry date.“She’s better than any of the men,” said Ann Smith, 75, a grandmother out walking her dog. “She really fights. I love the way she talks to people, especially the men. She’s well able for them.”For a movement that dates from the 1916 Easter Rising it is quite an arc: a succession of leaders with a whiff of sulphur culminating in a mother-of-two who studied English literature at Trinity College Dublin.“She’s very bright, articulate, self-confident and a good debater,” said Deaglán de Bréadún, the author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn Féin. “I’d say Sinn Féin couldn’t believe their luck when she joined. She’s such a good performer on radio and TV and it’s probably a help with southern voters that she doesn’t have a northern accent. All in all, it’s very hard for her political opponents to pick holes in her image.”Talk of seismic breakthrough may be overdone. McDonald is not about to become taoiseach. Sinn Féin’s results traditionally underperform opinion polls. The party fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament, so will not fully translate support into seats.Analysts expect Fianna Fáil to win about 50 to 55 seats, Fine Gael perhaps 35, and Sinn Féin 26 or at most 30. The two establishment parties have ruled out forming a coalition government with Sinn Féin, but it may yet play kingmaker.“It’s not revolution, it’s evolution,” said Dr Theresa Reidy, a political scientist and election expert at University College Cork. “For Sinn Fein it’s more about consolidation.”Even so, McDonald finds herself leading a remarkable turnaround. A party Irish voters used to shun as radioactive, an off-putting mix of Northern Ireland accents and Troubles vibes, has overtaken leftwing rivals and established itself as a voice for those who view Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael as the TweedledumTweedledee stasis.McDonald grew up in Rathgar, a middle-class suburb of Dublin, and attended a Catholic school, Notre Dame des Missions, before studying Sylvia Plath and metaphysical poets at Trinity, formerly a Protestant bastion.She worked as a researcher at the Institute of International and European Affairs, a thinktank, before joining Fianna Fáil, the party of her parents, before switching to Sinn Féin in 1999, a year after the Good Friday agreement.One version says she left because a Fianna Fáil bigwig stymied her advancement. McDonald’s version is she wanted a better fit for her principles about social justice and Irish unity.“She’s not lacking in political ambition but has fully converted to Sinn Féin ideology. You don’t thrive in that party without buying into its Irish republican mindset,” said De Bréadún.The party fast-tracked McDonald up the ranks: an MEP in 2004, a TD (MP) in 2011, then succeeding Adams as party leader in 2018. She praised him as her “political mentor” and ended a speech with “tiocfaidh ár lá”.McDonald can be “wooly” on detail but speaks with a passion that distinguishes Sinn Féin from other parties, said Reidy, the professor.Voters at first seemed unmoved. They abandoned Sinn Féin in a 2018 presidential election and in 2019 council and European parliamentary elections. The party braced for more losses in the general election, so fielded few candidates. Then the poll numbers started rising – and rising.The economy hums at near full-employment but voters are fatigued with the Fine Gael-led government, which was propped up by Fianna Fáil, and angry at hospital bed shortages and soaring rents. McDonald, ably supported by party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Eoin Ó Broin, has cast Sinn Féin as a vehicle for change.The party keenest on unification paradoxically benefitted from voter indifference towards Northern Ireland. Barely a blip in the campaign, it let Sinn Féin focus on bread-and-butter issues.That changed this week when a notorious 2007 murder returned to haunt the party, forcing McDonald to revisit Sinn Féin’s links with the IRA since the Troubles.Some voters recoiled. “Too many unanswered questions,” said Michelle Walsh, 51, a Dublin Central constituent who does not plan to vote for McDonald.Claire Beatty, 45, another constituent, said history had “leaked” out but that McDonald’s party still represented change. “The past has stuck with them but people are being left with no alternative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/617d837f61faed94290c2e59bd180e55b552bc61/0_380_5537_3322/master/5537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22def5145d6bef12cfc3f817f4e76d9f","title":"mike pence hints uks huawei decision could jeopardise trade talks","story":"Vice-president says US is ‘profoundly disappointed’ with Chinese firm’s 5G involvementUS vice-president Mike Pence appeared to hint on Friday that White House disquiet at the involvement of Huawei in building the UK’s 5G network could jeopardise trade talks between the two countries.Pence told the US broadcaster CNBC: “The United States is very disappointed that the United Kingdom has decided to go forward with Huawei.“We are profoundly disappointed … When I went at the president’s direction in September I met with Prime Minister Johnson and I told him the moment the UK was out of Brexit we were willing to begin to negotiate a free trade arrangement with the UK.”Asked whether the decision could prove a “deal-breaker”, he replied: “We’ll see.”The US considers the Chinese technology firm to be a security risk – but also appears to be exercised about its commercial dominance.Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, has even said this week that the US should be “actively considering” buying up stakes in Huawei’s rivals Nokia and Ericsson, to offset Chinese control of the telecoms sector, “either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies”.The British government has been keen to press ahead with trade negotiations with Washington.In a written ministerial statement published on Thursday, the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said: “A key priority is to deepen trade and investment relationships with like-minded partners, starting with the USA, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.”She set out some of the government’s aims, including opening up more of the lucrative US services market to British companies.But London and Washington have clashed over a series of policy issues in recent weeks, including the chancellor’s determination to press ahead with the digital services tax.The initial reaction from US officials to the Huawei decision was muted, but it emerged on Thursday that the president vented his exasperation in a phone call with Boris Johnson last week. Trump was “apoplectic”, sources with knowledge of the call told the FT.The UK has said it will allow Huawei to be involved in building “peripheral” parts of the 5G and full-fibre network, despite labelling it a “high-risk vendor”.Several high-profile Conservative MPs, including former cabinet ministers David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith, have expressed concerns about the decision.Some backbench rebels are pressing the government to announce a deadline for removing Huawei from the UK altogether.One Tory rebel said they had been emboldened by news of Trump’s anger, and would continue to demand concessions from No 10.A spokesman for the prime minister declined to be drawn on the Trump conversation, merely repeating the official readout from the call at the time, which said Johnson had, “underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to ersify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies”.Truss’s job had been widely thought to be at risk in the forthcoming reshuffle, which is expected next Thursday, but Johnson repeatedly name-checked her in his Brexit speech last Monday.She had pressed for negotiations with the US to kick off immediately, in parallel with talks with Brussels over the future relationship with the EU27.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is on a tour of Australia, Japan and New Zealand this week, seeking to underline the UK’s determination to strike up closer trading relationships with countries beyond the EU after Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502c90396bcee4d31f25b3cec960b99e6705fc95/0_0_6948_4169/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7905643344312dab4c8260ebafd7c989","title":"back to the future why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture","story":"From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselvesNever before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

The site in Armenia was constructed in 1943 to conduct top-secret research into atomic reactions for the development of nuclear weapons. Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.Arshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.Arriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.Technicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.Inside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there’s nothing to disturb them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama.China’s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country – a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise – as well as 24,702 suspected cases.Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.If you’ve been affected and would like to share your experience or news tips, anonymously if you prefer, direct with our journalists then please do so via the form below.

The forecast for the final game in Johannesburg on Sunday is also stormy.It promises to be a similarly make-do affair in any case, as Eoin Morgan talked openly after this game about not going out to win the series but instead using it to find out more about his players. “It won’t be about picking the strongest team,” Morgan said.This seems understandable from an England point of view. But in isolation it is a fairly startling admission at any level of sport and presumably not one that was included in the pre-series marketing. Morgan also spoke about the “great energy” Ben Stokes has been injecting behind the scenes. Which is no doubt a great thing for the England team but not so much for the paying spectators of Kingsmead.The truncated day made for a frustrating tableau on a white-ball tour that still feels as though it has barely revved out of second gear. England picked an unchanged team in Durban, a chance for those who were easily cuffed aside in Cape Town to reassert their credentials. South Africa brought in the left-arm spinner Bjorn Fortuin to make his debut in place of Lungi Ngidi, another step in the host nation’s own ongoing rebuild.England won the toss and bowled on a pitch that was miraculously fit to play despite the torrential gusts of water pouring from the skies before the start. Morgan had spoken about the need to create pressure in the field despite coming here armed with a depleted bowling attack.England opened up again with Chris Woakes, bowling to two slips in conditions that seemed tailored to his best snaking length with the new ball. His first ball was a zinger that seamed past Quinton de Kock’s outside edge. After which Woakes bowled a little straight to both left- and right-handers.From the other end Sam Curran began with a 78mph wide and was then pulled and driven to the fence with elegant ease by Reeza Hendricks. Curran is at his most effective bowling with the new ball, England insist. But how effective is that? What level of effectiveness are we talking here?Joe Root came on first change and almost immediately removed De Kock with a ball that rushed on and drew a half-and-half prod. Root had been grabbing the ball and sprinting back to his mark. Certainly De Kock seemed only half switched on as the ball pinged back his leg stump. “Joe’s an underrated bowler,” Morgan pointed out at the end.Hendricks played with some fluency at the other end but the rain returned with South Africa on 38 for one after 6.3 overs. Five hours later the players were back out in hope of completing the reduced game. There was a brief sparkle of action. Tom Curran resumed from the Friendship Pavilion end and saw his fourth ball swung high over midwicket for six by Temba Bavuma to the whoops and cheers of a grateful, scattered crowd.The final act before the players were off again was the dismissal of Bavuma, lbw on review to a ball from Chris Jordan that he tried to pull. Not much has gone emphatically right for England in this series to date. But Jordan has dismissed Bavuma twice in the space of 12 balls, both lbw. After a brief hokey-cokey the rains returned with a vengeance and the day was done. England will hope for a shift of pressure in Johannesburg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2304f369f400610467419e02ccd040bb1aedad5/0_108_2633_1580/master/2633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d3c182860cf9886f87c13257c16c00a","title":"saracens champions cup expulsion ineligible player misconduct hearing rugby union","story":"Saracens’ Champions Cup defence could be under threat after it emerged that prop Titi Lamositele may have been ineligible to play against Racing 92 last month. The European champions are subject to a misconduct complaint after the tournament organisers were informed by Saracens that United States international Lamositele’s work permit expired the day before their 27-24 victory at Allianz Park.Although there is no precedent for this sort of administrative error, French club Grenoble were heavily punished for fielding an ineligible player against London Welsh in the 2012-13 European Challenge Cup. Grenoble, who won the game 20-9, were deducted four match points as London Welsh were awarded a 28-0 victory.Saracens finished second in their Champions Cup group last month to secure an away quarter-final at Leinster on 4 April. But if the 27-24 victory against Racing, which pushed Glasgow Warriors out of the final Champions Cup quarter-final spot, is overturned, or Saracens are docked at least two match points, then they would be out of the competition.“Following an investigation, EPCR has decided to bring a misconduct complaint against Saracens arising from the club’s Champions Cup, Round 6 match against Racing 92 on Sunday, 19 January,” said an European Professional Club Rugby statement.“EPCR was informed by Saracens earlier this week that their player, Titi Lamositele, who was named in the match day squad for the fixture at Allianz Park and who came on to the field of play as a replacement in the 60th minute, may have been ineligible due an inadvertent administrative error on behalf of the club.“Lamositele was eligible at the time the Saracens matchday squad was announced, however, the club has indicated to EPCR that the player’s work permit expired on Saturday, 18 January, the day before the fixture against Racing 92, and this may have constituted a breach of the disciplinary rules of the 201920 EPCR Participation Agreement.“EPCR will be making no further comment until the decision of the independent disciplinary committee has been communicated.”An independent disciplinary committee consisting of Roger Morris (Wales), Pamela Woodman (Scotland) and Jean-Noel Couraud (France) will hear the misconduct complaint in London on Friday evening.The misconduct complaint is the latest sorry episode in a nightmare season for Saracens. The English and European champions will be relegated from the Gallagher Premiership at the end of this season over the salary cap scandal.Saracens were docked 35 league points – and then an additional 70 – and fined £5.36m for salary cap breaches, and will spend next season in the second-tier Championship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/688dbe906e49c94f61695a35f3790600b05dbc17/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b044d2fe5a99a3fc8eb5e85e969d22f","title":"england jofra archer cricket barney ronay","story":"Well, they’ve done it. They’ve broken Jofra. It’s taken nine months, vied up into one Technicolor English summer and one angst-ridden winter of injury, fudge and friction. But they got there in the end. And – fair play to the lads – in good time too.Spike Milligan had the phrase “I told you I was ill” inscribed on his headstone. Archer might be tempted to post something similar in response to the news he will miss the next three months of cricket with a long-standing stress fracture of the elbow that has only now been diagnosed correctly.I told you I had a serious, debilitating injury: one I’ve played with since the World Cup while bowling more overs than any other England cricketer. And while simultaneously being accused, sotto voce, of not always trying, of being a complex character, of not “letting rip” when the team demanded it.In the meantime, well, not exactly a surprise, is it? In play-writing there’s a principle known as Chekhov’s gun. This dictates that if there’s a rifle hanging above the fireplace in Act One, it’s going to be fired at someone’s head by the end of Act Five.A similar process applies to England cricket, fast bowlers and any kind of unorthodox, non-standard talent. Stick all three of them on the same stage and you can be pretty sure before long the air will be thick with gunpowder smoke, wrong turns and a generalised fug of error and confusion.Look clearly and Archer is entirely blameless in all of these things: a self-made 24-year-old cricketer, an inspiring story against the odds, and a man who might smile to himself at being lectured on toughness in adversity by the pathway products around him. So what is happening here?Two things stand out. First, Archer is an outsider in so many ways in the narrow parish of elite English cricket. It isn’t simply the fact he grew up in Barbados, or is a rare black male cricketer to earn a full ECB contract. It’s also the fact he’s from another place as a sportsman, talked about as though he’s some bright-eyed creature found shivering in the treeline, the guy who wears his jumper around his waist, who doesn’t carry the familiar signifiers of this sealed sporting-industrial life.Statements such as these should be seen in the context of both these layers of otherness: “He needs to ramp it up more ... The energy and effort have to be there all the time.” “We want every ball to be an effort ball.” “Your body hurts at times ... You’ve just got to choose to do it, really.” “Culturally he is different.”The words, there, of England’s captain, head coach and director of cricket at various times this winter. Speaking, to be clear, about a bloke bowling through a stress fracture, while leading England’s attack in his first season of international cricket. All of these quotes are set in the middle of warm words about Archer’s performances, all couched with sympathetic talk about how much he is putting in. But still, there are words and phrases that jar. Trying hard. Culture. Effort. “Yes, this does hurt, son. But get on with it, eh?”Plus we’ve had the standard klaxon-parping talk about body language, about unacceptable diet, about the need to really “bust a gut” in training. Nobody else gets this stuff. Nobody mentions Stuart Broad’s up-and-down intensity levels, the sense of a bowler (successfully and correctly) looking after himself. Nobody urges Joe Root himself to put “more effort” in or talks about mental fragility when he keeps getting out just past 50. Why not?I’m not qualified to define the mechanics of being a black athlete in a white sporting culture. But you do see patterns, faint memories of the way football has been, echoes of Daniel Sturridge (but not Andy Carroll) being accused of having “a low pain threshold” or Ron Noades talking about the need for hard white players to get you through the winter.I don’t think this is conscious, or founded in ill-will. But it strikes a false note. More to the point, it won’t help get the best out of a stellar, highly specialised cricketing talent. Clearly there is a need to take a look at how England’s homogeneous “team culture” deals with difference, outsiderdom and unusual ways of being a highly talented cricketer.This isn’t just about accepting some people walk and speak and respond a little differently. It’s about the need to take care of a once-in-a-generation athlete who can bowl his second ball at 92mph, and who should be treated with the level of informed sports science his talent demands.The issue of “over-bowling” will of course rumble around, a process that feels like using your handcrafted Glock pistol to bang in a fence post, but which is above all a sign of confusion.The only people I’ve heard talk compelling sense about Archer are Mike Selvey, who compared his style to Jeff Thomson, and seemed to say if you think Archer’s not trying you don’t understand the mechanics of fast bowling and Archer’s coach at the Rajasthan Royals, who works specifically on short bursts, on understanding his specific physicality, his personality, the way his body works.For now a quiet apology and a reboot in the relationship would be a good start. Handled right, Archer can be a source of delight. This is what success looks like: right there. Time perhaps to ask him what he needs, rather than tell him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e5b9d893c83723111d05dc0366c064072671e3/381_429_2619_1571/master/2619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6b3fcba8c4379640764c7e02da77ea","title":"carlos acosta announces bold plans for birmingham royal ballet","story":"New artistic director aims to attract younger audiences and promises more than 20,000 tickets for £20 or less as company reveals 2020 programmeCarlos Acosta has pledged to transform Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB) and bring ballet’s traditional image into the 21st century as he takes over as artistic director. On Friday he announced his first programme for 2020, including a three-week summer festival ning London and Birmingham.Havana-born Acosta, 46, is a former principal dancer with the Royal Ballet. Since retiring four years ago from the classical roles that made him famous, he has launched a contemporary company, Acosta Danza, in Cuba.Acosta wanted the Birmingham job because “I felt the need to go back to my roots as a ballet dancer,” he says. “Ballet is my best friend. It was my refuge it’s what I had when everything didn’t make sense. It was not just a job. I’ve been very privileged to perform with many companies and gain this wealth of knowledge that I want to pass on.”His plans for the 74-year-old company are ambitious. “I want the level of the dancers to be raised dramatically, and the repertoire I’m bringing is crucial,” he says. “I want a company that is strong, that is not predictable, that is energetic, that takes risks, but stays true to tradition at the highest level. I’m up for big crazy ideas. I’m never going to say no to anything that’s new and bold.”Acosta’s spirited production of Don Quixote, first performed in 2013, will be at the centre of the Curated By Carlos festival this June. It marks the first time it has been performed in the UK outside London. Elsewhere, in an eclectic mixed bill, Acosta will perform a duet with Alessandra Ferri by Spanish choreographer Goyo Montero, alongside a world premiere from Brazilian-British choreographer Daniela Cardim and George Balanchine’s Theme and Variations. The festival, which Acosta hopes will help the company “position ourselves as a brand that can entertain at all levels”, will also include artist Conrad Shawcross’s installation, The Ada Project, a robotic sculpture programmed with choreographed movement. An important part of Acosta’s vision for BRB is staging the work of international choreographers unknown in Britain. In the autumn the company will dance the first UK performance of a work by Uwe Scholz, former director of Leipzig Ballet. Scholz’s interpretation of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony is programmed alongside Jiří Kylián’s epic Forgotten Land, set to Britten’s Sinfonia da Requiem. Acosta also plans collaborations beyond the ballet world, including Birmingham organisation Sampad.In 2021, BRB will perform at London’s Royal Opera House for the first time in 20 years and tour to smaller towns and cities that may not usually see ballet at this level.BRB was founded in 1946 as the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet, which became the touring arm of the Royal Ballet before the company moved to Birmingham in 1990. David Bintley retired in 2019 after 24 years at the helm. In recent years, the company has been respected for the quality of its work and dancers, but has not always been considered the most artistically exciting troupe.He plans to change the type of ballets the company commissions to reflect 21st-century Britain. “I want to come up with stories that represent Birmingham, a proposition that is completely different to the rest of the companies in the UK. Stories that are not the obvious ones, so people start looking at us in a different light. When you talk about a traditional company, some people might think, ‘yesterday’. I want people to see us as ‘now’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06d70741aa1c40eb454a4c698cb8d219ab2c232/97_287_2505_1504/master/2505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63ed89eafbb98bad80c400f9d4f65e6e","title":"return to heaven review tobacco factory bristol","story":"Tobacco Factory, BristolMark Bruce’s latest work is sensationally stimulating but perilously dizzying and hard to stomachMark Bruce is a fascinating, highly distinctive choreographer, his work frequently spiralling around themes of darkness, myth, fantasy and the unconscious. His recent pieces – Macbeth, The Odyssey, Dracula – folded these fixations into well-known narratives, but Return to Heaven harks back to a more fractured, collagistic mode indeed it draws directly on images and effects from earlier works, notably Made in Heaven.This is both its strength and weakness. On the one hand, liberated from story, Bruce’s free associations lead to some delirious images, jump-cuts and fusions. A headless giant looms in the darkness. An astronaut falls to earth. In one vertiginous mashup of dystopian road movie and classic horror, two fugitives in a car (Eleanor Duval and Dane Hurst) are stopped by cops, one of whom, his face pelleted by bullet holes, seems to be a zombie. Meanwhile, dismembered hands spider-crawl across Duval’s hair. She mutates into a vampire and gets Hurst in the neck.On the other hand, it’s like being on a rollercoaster, ghost train, merry-go-round and the dodgems all at once: sensationally stimulating but perilously dizzying and sometimes hard to stomach. Here’s an ice-cream seller handing over a mystic key. There’s a corpse-bride, briefly emerging from the shadows, scientists in gas masks, a cajun cowgirl, a giant shark. Now we’re in a swampy forest now on the moon now in a pharaoh’s tomb.Catching everything the piece throws at them are the designs – light, set and costumes all fantastically versatile – and ultimately the skilled dancers themselves, who come into their own especially in some tautly inventive choreographic episodes: a frenetic group thrash on the floor a ferocious kneeling duet, with Jordi Calpe Serrats and Carina Howard rising and lunging like hooded cobras.It might work better with a more informal, irreverent presentation that plays up to the cultish, B-movie undercurrents, releasing its wry laughs and occasional guffaws. Still, when it falters, Return to Heaven can look hollow or even silly, and though its scenes often work well inidually they lose impact cumulatively. Certainly it needs no narrative, but such threads that it does have – winding between calypso, Anubis and outer space – string the work out more than they pull it together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59ebe7932ef6c1bfe56e692ffa643a84bad3805f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8549229786268f6d7659ce0a01321f93","title":"from the iowa caucuses to the barnes and noble fiasco its clear tech cannot save us","story":"We have fallen for the idea that apps and artificial intelligence can substitute judgement and hard work. They can’tEvery four years, journalists from around the world are drawn to the Iowa caucuses like podcasters to a murder. The blatantly anti-democratic tradition appeals to certain journalistic biases: the steadfast belief of the political press that rural Americans are more authentically American than the vast majority of Americans who live in cities and suburbs – and the irresistible opportunity to pedantically explain arcane rules. You can also get something called a “pie shake” in Iowa, which is, truly, delicious.I understand the appeal. In 2008, as a graduate student at the University of Iowa, I was so enthusiastic about the caucuses that I stayed in town through winter break during the snowiest Iowa winter on record, rather than risk missing my chance to caucus for Barack Obama. (This was long before I had even considered journalism as a career.) The exercise in “democracy” that I ended up experiencing was patently absurd.The Democratic party caucuses drew a record turnout in 2008, and mine was packed. Crammed into a campus lecture hall with theater-style seating, none of the “how to caucus” tutorials that advised sending each candidate’s supporters to a different corner of the room applied. The vast majority of people in the room supported Obama, but figuring out exactly how many people that was eluded the party officials in charge. They told the volunteers coordinating the Obama group to come up with their count – and do it quickly. Those volunteers had come prepared they had written the numbers one to 500 on slips of construction paper, which they planned to give to each Obama supporter. The last card distributed would equal the total vote count.It was a perfectly reasonable plan that fell apart the moment someone got impatient and broke the single, numerically-ordered stack, into multiple stacks. Thus ensued much shouting and recrimination, futile attempts to claw back the cards, and vague threats from the party officials. By the time we were ready to start the second stage of caucusing – when those who opt for candidates with insufficient support can switch to their second choice – results from around the state were already being reported and discussed in our room, influencing some people’s decisions. It was a mess.That ill-fated stack of cards in my caucus was a kind of analog version of the now infamous app that set off the Democratic party’s woes in Iowa this week: a perfectly fine idea stymied by poor execution, impatience, and a tendency to seek shortcuts.Silicon Valley is the current spiritual home of hucksters selling plausible-sounding, technological “solutions” to complicated societal problems, so it’s not exactly surprising that the company that bungled the caucus app is tied to a group that exemplifies this unhappy intersection. Acronym, and its affiliated Super Pac, Pacronym, racked up glowing press by selling the idea that Democrats could win back the White House with better digital ads and a propaganda operation designed to appeal to Facebook users.I’m sure that their pitch sounded very convincing. Advanced technology so often does. Just this week, America’s largest bookseller allowed artificial intelligence to convince it that the heroine of the Secret Garden – the child of British colonists in India who was sent home to be raised by her uncle in an English manor house – could be anything other than white. We are a country that allowed Theranos to perform blood tests on actual patients without ever proving its product worked that has confronted the epidemic of school shootings with invasive digital surveillance of students’ email accounts.We have become untenably susceptible to the idea that AI is a substitute for judgment and that technological shortcuts are a viable strategy. They aren’t. Pulling the US back from the brink of authoritarianism is not going to be accomplished with Facebook ads and liberal propaganda masquerading as local news. It’s going to take incredibly hard work from political and community organizers persuading those under the spell of Trump’s demagoguery, motivating the unmotivated to vote – and working precinct by precinct to counteract the well-funded systematic efforts to disenfranchise large swaths of the electorate.There are no shortcuts to reviving American’s democracy. Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling you something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8322b02fccb03ca36c42116b2fcf6f07012b0302/160_0_5623_3374/master/5623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e9a1e1137e23d495cb54a4427c945be","title":"in pictures eight hidden gems of north west france","story":"From vintage steam trains and magical medieval chateaux to corking sparkling wine, north-west France has something to offer all the family.Feeling inspired?

At first glance, their latest global launch, Locke and Key, seems like some sort of optimised Netflix megamix: set in a creepy mansion full of arcane mysteries (like The Haunting of Hill House), it centres on young kids shellshocked by the death of a parent (as in Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events) and features supernatural forces elbowing their way into the real world (a la Stranger Things).The source material – a long-established comic series created by writer Joe Hill and artist Gabriel Rodriguez – predates the rise of Netflix but it is remarkable how it dovetails with the streaming service’s thematic obsessions and commercial priorities (all the more remarkable when you learn of its chequered history, with three different pilots filmed at various studios in the past decade and ambitious plans for a movie trilogy shelved). It is, at heart, a horror-tinged fantasy epic, but before all the spooky stuff really kicks in, it begins as a textured and wrenching story of loss.After the abrupt murder of teacher Rendell Locke, harrowingly relived in flashback, his widow Nina (Darby Stanchfield) is in the process of relocating their young family from rainy Washington to chilly Massachusetts. This is the site of Rendell’s long-abandoned family seat, Keyhouse, a gothic pile on the outskirts of the small town of Matheson. If Nina has uprooted their lives in search of a fresh start, the locals are already aware of – and acutely intrigued by – the Locke family’s tragic circumstances.Adolescents Tyler (Connor Jessup) and Kinsey (Emilia Jones) are wrestling with heightened feelings of anger and anguish over their father’s death. Seemingly less affected is their much younger brother Bode (Jackson Robert Scott, who played poor doomed Georgie in the recent It films). His name is pronounced “Bodie”, and with his predilection for wandering off, it is shouted aloud so often you begin to wonder if the late Rendell’s many secrets included a deep love for 1970s Brit-cop classic The Professionals.After experiencing such seismic trauma, the bickering young Lockes are in bad shape, and when they pull up in front of their new digs, the mansion looms over them hungrily. It is a terrific bit of production design, somewhere between the gothic silhouette of the Addams Family’s 1313 Cemetery Lane and the grand but higgledy-piggledy chateau from Knives Out. Inside, the echoey rooms and hallways feature enviable cornicing and a lot of weird-looking doors.Keyhouse represents the Locke family legacy in more ways than one, as the kids soon uncover a sprawling supernatural mythology that revolves around enchanted keys, each with its own signature power. Bode, most attuned to the occult vibrations of a magical world apparently undetectable to adults, hears them whispering from nooks and crannies. He also strikes up a friendship with a spectral voice (Laysla De Oliveira) at the bottom of Keyhouse’s neglected well.It sounds like an odd thing to say when discussing ancient keys imbued with supernatural powers, but the magical stuff seems innocuous enough at first, even fun. One key turns any door into a gateway to any other door the user has ever seen: fantastical, but easy enough to get your head around as a concept. It is only a few episodes in, once Bode has harvested more of the scattered artefacts, that it is intimated that some keys have the power to unlock people, manifesting Cronenberg-esque holes in their flesh. It hints at how wild the series becomes, mixing haunted house tropes with some of the psychedelic innerspace voyages of Legion.Another useful touchstone is Buffy, since the elder Locke kids are trying to fit in at their new school while also trying to cope with demonic incursions. In this, Locke and Key benefits from two excellent performances at its centre. Jessup, who bears a striking resemblance to a young Ryan Phillippe, is the surprisingly sensitive hockey jock who feels responsible for his father’s death while his introvert artist sister, played by English actor Jones, chooses such a radical shortcut in dealing with her mental pain that she essentially gets a whole new character to play.This first 10-episode season has been overseen by Carlton Cuse (the former Lost co-producer who transformed Bates Motel from desperate-sounding Psycho prequel into something with its own unsettling flavour) and Meredith Averill (producer and writer on The Haunting of Hill House). Both have experience in wringing unexpected new directions out of old tropes.While much of Locke and Key feels superficially familiar, cushioned by the superior production design and a lush score, there are enough deliberately disconcerting or oddball moments to make it a constantly evolving pleasure. And, with multiple volumes of the collected comic series already on bookstore shelves, this reincarnation could just be the start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac68ccf45dc541ca419f88971bb9aafb9ddea797/0_175_3688_2213/master/3688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a74e37877a04f7fef311785c17b662b7","title":"chuck sims africa move 9 freed philadelphia","story":"One of the great open wounds of the black liberation struggle of the 1970s has finally been healed with the release of the last member of the Move 9, the group of radicals rounded up in a Philadelphia police siege in 1978 and held behind bars for more than four decades.Chuck Sims Africa, 59, walked free from the Fayette state correctional institution in La Belle, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning. The youngest of the incarcerated group, he has been in custody since shortly after he turned 18.His freedom marked his reunion with his family for the first time in almost 42 years. It was also historic, as it closed a chapter that had remained unfinished since the black power movement erupted in the late 1960s.Alongside the Black Panthers, Philadelphia’s Move organisation was central to the volatile and at times violent struggle for black equality that lasted until the 1980s.Members of the organisation regarded themselves – and still do to this day – as part of a family dedicated to race equality, with all members taking the last name “Africa”. Part Panthers and part eco-hippies, they also had a commitment to environmental justice that was ahead of its time.Mike Africa Jr, the son of two of the Move 9, said Chuck’s release put an end to a long and gruelling campaign. “We will never have to shout ‘Free the Move 9!’ ever again. It’s been 41 years, and now we’ll never have to say it.”For Mike Africa, who is also Chuck’s nephew, the release was especially poignant. He was born in a cell five weeks after his mother, Debbie Sims Africa, Chuck’s sister, was rounded up in the 1978 siege and incarcerated – she gave birth to him unbeknown to the prison guards and kept him hidden with her in the cell for the first few days of his life. began investigating the prolonged imprisonment of the Move 9 in 2018 as part of an examination into black power behind bars. At that time all the surviving members of the group were still in custody in various Pennsylvania prisons.Members of the group described in letters, emails and prison interviews how they had endured so many years inside while keeping their spirits high. Janine Phillips Africa said that she raised therapy dogs in her cell and grew vegetables in the prison yard, avoiding birthdays or holidays that reminded her of the passage of time.“The years are not my focus,” she wrote in a letter to the . “I keep my mind on my health and the things I need to do day by day.”Delbert Orr Africa said: “We’ve suffered the worst that this system can throw at us – decades of imprisonment, loss of loved ones. So we know we are strong.”Soon after the  began its investigation, the seven surviving members of the group began to be released on parole. First up was Debbie Sims Africa, set free in June 2018. “We are peaceful people,” she said as she stepped out of Cambridge Springs prison.Then the other six began to emerge, one after the other like falling dominoes:* Janine Phillips Africa and Janet Holloway Africa, May 2019Chuck Sims Africa completes the set.The Move 9 were arrested following a massive police siege of their collective headquarters and home in Powelton Village, Philadelphia, on 8 August 1978. Hundreds of police officers in Swat teams armed with machine guns, teargas, bulldozers and water cannons surrounded the property following a long standoff with city authorities that saw the group as a threat to the community.The siege culminated in a police shootout in which Move members allegedly returned fire though they denied doing so. A police officer, James Ramp, was killed in the crossfire.Nine members were arrested and held jointly responsible for Ramp’s death despite forensic evidence showing he was killed with a single bullet. In 1980 the nine were convicted of third-degree murder and lesser offenses and each sentenced to 30 years to life.Two of the nine – Merle and Phil Africa – died in prison. The remaining seven fought for many years to convince parole authorities that they were safe to be let out, pointing to clean discipline sheets in prison.Over the past two years there have been no security incidents relating to any of the paroled iniduals.Wilson Goode, former mayor of Philadelphia, wrote to the parole board to support Chuck Africa’s bid for freedom. He said: “His release will reunite a family after 40 years and I am convinced he will be a positive contributing voice to the Philadelphia community.”Goode, the first black mayor of Philadelphia, was in that position on 13 May 1985 when the second disaster relating to Move occurred. Following another prolonged bout of acrimony between the organisation and its neighbors and city authorities, the decision was taken forcibly to evict the group from its latest headquarters, then in Osage Avenue.Another shootout broke out, and when that failed to flush them out police dropped incendiary bombs from a helicopter on to the roof of the building. A fire ensued which was allowed to spread, eventually razing to the ground 61 homes in the overwhelmingly African American neighborhood.Eleven people in the Move house, including five children, died in the inferno. Chuck Africa’s cousin, Frank, was among the adults who were killed.All the paroled members of the Move 9 are now preparing to mark the 35th anniversary of the tragedy. For the first time they will be able to commemorate the event and the relatives and peers they lost outside a prison cell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150a4275465faf655943db3845f3fc550a0a982d/0_0_4884_2931/master/4884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd018032a609d0fa029c023729a5382","title":"pete buttigieg new hampshire sanders iowa caucuses","story":"Pete Buttigieg goes into the crucial weekend before the New Hampshire primary as the unlikely leading threat to his more experienced rivals.Buttigieg, 38, and Bernie Sanders, 78, on Friday morning remained neck-and-neck in the results from the disastrous Iowa caucuses, with still no formal winner declared from the vote on Monday, which turned into a debacle after a new data collection app malfunctioned.Donald Trump left Washington for an event in North Carolina in ebullient mood after a week on the up. A day after what he called a “celebration” speech at the White House to mark his acquittal in the impeachment trial, he crowed: “The Democrat party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer ‘fried’.”Buttigieg was nipping Sanders’s heels in the latest opinion poll in New Hampshire – a blow to Sanders, because he represents the nextdoor New England state of Vermont, where he has been a leftwing fixture for decades. Sanders had hoped to be a shoo-in for a strong win in the New Hampshire primary.Biden has been noticeably less active than other candidates crisscrossing a snowy New Hampshire in the run-up to the primary on Tuesday.Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator, told the Washington Post: “From a Biden perspective … he’s got to have sharper elbows. History may write that the best thing that ever happened to Joe Biden was getting gut-punched in Iowa.”The official result from Iowa was still too close to call, and pressure is building on the candidates to make a good showing in New Hampshire.That didn’t stop Buttigieg from declaring victory in Iowa, on Twitter as he prepared to take the stage for a CNN event. “The first time I was here, few people knew me or how to pronounce my name. Now we’ve won the Iowa caucuses and we’re just five days away from the New Hampshire Primary,” he wrote.His campaign was hyperactive in Iowa: he has visited the majority of counties that swung from Obama to Trump, taking advantage of the sitting senators who are running – Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Sanders and long-shot Michael Bennet – having to be in Washington over much of the last two weeks for the impeachment trial.“We needed a new path forward, a path that welcomed people instead of pushing them away, brought them together instead of driving them apart, because this is our best and maybe our last shot,” Buttigieg told anxious but optimistic supporters during the limbo after caucusing on Monday in Des Moines, while the results were delayed.The results come in a contest marred by fresh revelations about technical issues and reporting delays that have led to allegations of inaccuracy.Sanders, calling the caucus “a screw-up”, condemned the Iowa Democratic party.“I think what has happened with the Iowa Democratic party is an outrage – that they were that unprepared. That they put forth such a complicated process, relied on untested technology,” Sanders said.Asked by reporters why people should believe his declaration of victory over Buttigieg’s, Sanders said: “Because I got 6,000 more votes.”However, the “raw” popular vote is overridden by the allocation to each candidate of state delegates, which are based on a slightly different measure. State by state, that ultimately determines the party nominee to fight for the White House.Wading into the growing chaos over Iowa, the Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez, called for a “recanvass” – essentially a review of the paperwork from each voting site.At an event at his New Hampshire state campaign headquarters in Manchester on Thursday, Sanders said his campaign was ahead.“Our campaign is winning the popular initial vote by some 6,000 popular votes,” he said.The deadlocked contest gives Buttigieg and Sanders a burst of momentum as they seek to pull away from the crowded field.Buttigieg, a moderate, openly gay military veteran who has been out on the trail with his husband, Chasten and Sanders, a longtime socialist and independent senator who has been campaigning with his wife, Jane are separated by 40 years in age and conflicting ideology.The leading candidates were set to duel publicly on stage at a high-stakes TV debate in New Hampshire on Friday night, in which Buttigieg and Sanders were expected to squabble over who has the lead, and Warren and Biden were under pressure not to slip out of the limelight and lose momentum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

Losing a crop variety is as irreversible as the extinction of an animal or bird.On 25 February, nine Cherokee seeds will be deposited into the vault, deep inside a mountain on permanently frozen ground called permafrost.The seeds chosen are Cherokee white eagle corn – the tribe’s most sacred corn, used for cultural ceremonies – Cherokee long greasy beans, Cherokee Trail of Tears beans, Cherokee turkey gizzard black and brown beans, Cherokee candy roaster squash and three other varieties of corn. The crops predate European settlement and are a core part of Cherokee identity.The Cherokee seeds will be only the second deposit from an indigenous community to be stored in the Svalbard vault, following the deposit of 750 South American Andean potato seeds in 2015. “The Cherokee nation is the only place on the planet where all these crops are grown, and these days tough weather patterns make the situation precarious,” Pat Gwin, the tribe’s senior director of environmental resources, told the  from Oklahoma.Oklahoma is prone to tornadoes and has suffered two record droughts and multiple floods in the past decade. Extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis are on the rise.There are more than 1,700 food gene banks across the world but many are considered vulnerable to natural catastrophes, war, funding deficits, erratic electricity or poor management.The Svalbard vault, which has the capacity to hold 4.5m crop varieties, was created in conditions resilient to natural and manmade disasters, in order to safeguard duplicates of samples kept elsewhere. It is well above sea level and the permafrost and thick rock ensure seeds remain frozen even without power. The vault is only accessible via a 120-metre tunnel.Svalbard includes unique varieties of African and Asian staples such as maize, rice, wheat and sorghum, as well as European and South American varieties of aubergine, lettuce, barley and potato. About 500 seeds of each variety are stored at -18C in sealed foil packages.The climate crisis is still a threat: the vault has required multimillion-dollar upgrades to prevent flooding caused by extreme rainfall and melting of the permafrost.“Svalbard is the ultimate failsafe for bioersity of crops,” said Stefan Schmitz, executive director of the Crop Trust, which manages the vault with the Norwegian government and the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. “It’s important for the Cherokee nation to have this vital back-up.”It has been a long road. In 1838, 15,000 Cherokee were expelled by US military and militia from their homelands in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, then forced west to Indian territory, present-day Oklahoma. The Cherokee lost about a quarter of their people and their traditional plants and crops.Inspired by the Svalbard vault, tribal scientists led by Gwin spent several years tracking down “lost” crops in former territories and museums. They started two tribal gardens in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, dedicating one to cultivating 24 of the most significant Cherokee crops.Medicinal and inedible plants such as river cane, a type of bamboo traditionally used for construction, are also grown. Thousands of seed packets are sent each year to Cherokees across the world.“As long as Cherokee plants exist, we exist. This is so important,” said Gwin, 56. “We consider our plants to be as genetically Cherokee as we are.”In a statement, Chuck Hoskin Jr, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, said: “It is such an honor to have a piece of our culture preserved forever. Generations from now, these seeds will still hold our history and there will always be a part of the Cherokee Nation in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e229d82a7e0bf708e46834bfed9a409c4da417c/0_1_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ed7a7a833373c9b4a261e828ed4f7e","title":"a hard and sad decision fleeing coronavirus in wuhan for christmas island","story":"One Australian in quarantine speaks about leaving his elderly parents behind and the conditions he finds himself in nowAn Australian in quarantine on Christmas Island has spoken of his anguish at having to choose between staying with his elderly parents in Wuhan and taking an evacuation flight that would mean he could rejoin his wife and twin daughters in Australia.Prof Yan Zhang, an Australian citizen from Sydney who teaches at Western Sydney University, spoke to  Australia from the remote island detention centre as he undergoes a 14-day period of isolation.The 57-year old said it was hard to leave behind his parents, who are now vulnerable and unsupported by China’s under-pressure medical system.“It was a hard and also sad decision for me,” Zhang said. “On one hand, my wife and twin daughters are in Australia, and they worried about me so much and wished me to return as soon as possible.“But on the other hand, Wuhan has my parents and elder sister and her husband. Especially my father turns 93, and my mother 85 this year, they are quite fragile. I really worry about them.“After the Wuhan lockdown, all hospitals had to deal with patients with coronavirus infections, people with other issues had no place to see doctors. Now I can only pray my parents don’t get sick, and can overcome this difficult period.”Zhang said he was otherwise in good spirits, felt “healthy” and was not aware of any cases of coronavirus among the 277 Australians who have been evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan.Zhang thanked the Australian government for organising the evacuation flight out of Wuhan, where the new strain of coronavirus first emerged.Earlier, other Australians evacuating from Wuhan told  Australia they had concerns over the rudimentary health facilities on the island – especially for the elderly, the young and pregnant women.On Friday, Zhang said that to his knowledge, no Australians had come down with the new virus.“I’m very healthy,” he said. “I’m an amateur mountaineer. I have climbed some difficult peaks in New Zealand and the Himalayas. I’m not aware of anyone who got sick in here.”The Sydney professor said conditions were “not perfect” but adequate.“Life on Christmas Island is good enough for me. I have my own room, and we have sufficient outdoor space to walk around and do some exercise.“Food is a bit limited, too much meat for me, and lacking fruits and vegetables. Yesterday I had put some comments on this in the request book. Hopefully it will be improved.“We have a big oval ground, where we can do some walks. I usually get up at 5am, go to the oval to take photographs, for about one hour. During the daytime, I do some university research, write my diary.“In the afternoon I do some body weight exercises in my own room. After dinner I go to the oval again to take photos. I read books for about one or two hours before I go to bed at 9pm. I don’t feel bored at all.”The Australian government organised its first evacuation flight – using a jet provided by Qantas – to bring 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents out of Wuhan on Monday. A pregnant woman and her partner were taken to Perth to be nearer a tertiary hospital, but the rest were transferred to Christmas Island.Another 36 Australians were evacuated on a NZ-government chartered flight. They were also brought to Christmas Island.A second Australian-run evacuation flight was scheduled to leave Wuhan just after midnight Saturday morning.Those passengers will be quarantined at the now-disused Inpex workers village just outside Darwin in the Northern Territory, rather than on Christmas Island.The second Australian flight out of Wuhan was reportedly over-subscribed, with many more Australians trying to get out than there are seats on the plane. However, it is likely to be the last flight the government will be able to organise, with Chinese authorities unlikely to permit more evacuation missions from Australia.When the initial charter flight was announced, some Australians chose to stay in the city, preferring to wait for the outbreak to subside, but as it has spread and intensified, many are now taking the chance to leave.Globally, the outbreak has infected more than 31,000 people and killed 636, the vast majority of those in Hubei province.Zhang, who did his undergraduate studies in Wuhan, said it was “panic” in the city when the Chinese government announced it would be locked down to prevent the spread of the virus.“All kinds of transportation were cut off suddenly without any warning. I realised I couldn’t return to Sydney on my schedule of 29 January.“Some people thought the lockdown could finish within a couple of weeks, and things would get better. With the situation of Wuhan was getting worse every day, we finally realised our life in Wuhan would be much more difficult than initially thought.”“I would like to thank the Australian government to make this evacuation plan happen,” Zhang said. “Also I would like to tell outside people that conditions in Christmas Island are not perfect, but generally good from my personal point of view. Staff here are very responsible and supportive.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165306.1581109322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 30 adults and children tested for coronavirus so far in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLaboratory technicians work on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus in Wuhan. Photograph: STRAFP via Getty ImagesThere have been over 30 suspected cases of coronavirus in Ireland so far, with children among those tested, it has emerged.The suspected cases were in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Carlow and Kerry. And though all have tested negative, Irish public health experts have said they expect a case of the coronavirus to occur here.Out-of-hours and oncall doctors have already been supplied with protective equipment, including masks and gowns, while supplies will reach regular GPs next week, according to the HSE.Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the likelihood is that a case will occur here.“It’s not something we would be surprised by,” he said, adding that the strategy of the Department of Health and public health doctors was one of containment.So far, there have been no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Ireland. Fifteen suspected cases have occurred but were shown to be negative on testing.The virus, which originated in Wuhan in China in January, has led to more than 630 deaths. There have been more than 31,000 infections recorded, according to the latest figures.Ireland does not have any plans at present to step up checks on incoming flights, Dr Holohan told journalists at a technical briefing on Friday, though there could be circumstances in which the passengers on a specific flight could be screened. Point of entry screening is regarded as inefficient, he pointed out.Asked whether Ireland had any further plans to amend travel advice because of the virus, Dr Holohan said we were “in the hands” of the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose advice currently applies to people returning from mainland China only.The UK, which on Thursday reported a third case involving a traveller who contracted the virus in Singapore, has expanded the list of countries to which its travel advice applies Britain is free to do this after leaving the EU but Ireland follows the lead set by the European Centre for Disease Control.Dr Holohan acknowledged the situation was “fast-moving” and advised people to “stay abreast” of the situation. A communications network has been set up with GPs to ensure they are informed of the latest advice, and the issuing of personal protective equipment to doctors’ surgeries has begun, officials said.The WHO has warned the world is running out of masks and other equipment amid a surge in demand from efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Dr Holohan told RTÉ’s News at One that Ireland has “substantial supplies” at the moment, which are being distributed to GPs. Asked what quarantine arrangements were in place for suspected cases, Dr Holohan said Ireland’s approach was based on people self-isolating while symptoms were being checked, rather than quarantine.Head of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, Dr Cillian de Gacun, said the rising number of cases in China was “a concern” though the rate at which new cases were being reported in recent days had slowed.While they were questions about the capacity of China to test all new cases, scientists would be hoping to see a plateau in the outbreak over the coming weeks, he said.Dr Holohan said Ireland’s containment strategy involves recognising people with symptoms early and taking measures to prevent onward transmission. Containment, which focuses on cases regardless of severity, differs from a mitigation approach taken in the event of widespread transmission, which focuses on the most seriously ill cases."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Serious shortfalls in new system designed to make private voting easier, says activistCases tested in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Carlow and Kerry all negative but experts say likelihood is case will occur hereThe final bill for electrification of rail lines will be significantly higher than the \u0026euro2bn set out in the National Development PlanMan in his 30s remains in custody in connection with incident on Castlecomer Road\u0026lsquoI got my photo taken with Jack Lynch but Jack bought me no whiskey!\u0026rsquoPolice believe Continuity IRA planned to detonate device on ship to Scotland last FridayWinds of 120 kmh expected as Met \u0026Eacuteireann upgrades weather warning for polling dayEstimates suggest project will cost up to \u0026euro2.6bn, \u0026euro600m more than first plannedManager of bloodstock firm read in newspaper horse due to run in Naas, court hearsDispute centres over plans to outsource catering and household servicesShannen Joyce (25) has been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin\u0027s Lymphoma twiceLiam Wray asks judge Barnie McElholm to hold Bloody Sunday case in DerrySafety concerns had been expressed by garda\u0026iacute over school climate strike protestBook of evidence was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions on January 31stJohn Sankeni refused bail on theft charges related to money laundering investigation\u0026lsquoI though it was disgraceful ... for just being kind to an animal\u0026rsquo, says Limerick womanMiche\u0026aacutel Martin insists Fianna F\u0026aacuteil is only party capable of offering alternativeStatement made after Jim O\u0026rsquoCallaghan (FF) criticised for representing former SF leader"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165598.1581098406!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 19 rise in over 65s population may shape result","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVoters of the future: Pupils at Mount Anville National School on Lower Kilmacud Road, south Dublin holding a mock election on Friday morning.   Photograph Nick BradshawThe The over 65s have already made their presence felt in this general election by torpedoing plans to increase the minimum State pension age. And on Saturday they are set to have a bigger influence than in previous ballots - due to sheer numbers.In 38 of the 39 constituencies, there has been an increase in the number of people aged over 65, data from the Central Statistics Office shows. The exception is Dublin North West.The constituency of Kildare South has seen the largest increase in over 65s in the State since 2011. The population cohort has more than doubled (53 per cent) from 7,892 in 2011 to an estimated 12,061 today in the constituency, which includes the towns of Newbridge, Kildare and Athy.The constituency has also seen the largest population increase as whole since 2011 at 31 per cent from 87,776 to 114,810. This is in part due to a boundary change, with the constituency expanding in size since 2011.The data is based on CSO census constituency populations from 2011 and 2016.Across the State, the number of people aged over 65 has risen by almost one fifth (19 per cent)\u0026nbspsince 2011, the largest increase in any of age group category analysed. This is primarily due to declining death rates.In contrast, the population of under 35s is down 10 per cent in the same period.After Kildare South, the constituencies with the highest increase in over 65s are Cavan-Monaghan (41 per cent), Dublin Mid-West (40 per cent) and Dublin Central (39 per cent).In Dublin North West, the only constituency which bucked the trend, there has been a decrease in the over 65s population of 7 per cent since 2011.This pattern could have an important influence on marginal seats, given  opinion polls during the campaign show older people more favourable towards Fianna Fáil, while among the under 40s the most supported party was Sinn Féin.Under 35s Most constituencies have seen a decrease in the under-35 voting age population (18-34). The three constituencies with the biggest decline in this age group are all in Connacht with Sligo-Leitrim decreasing by 20 per cent, Galway East by 18 per cent and Galway West by 17 per cent.According to statisticians, the decline is attributable to falling birth rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as emigration trends since 2010 which saw many young people leave the country to find employment.Dublin Central and Cavan-Monaghan are the constituencies with the largest population increase in under 35s at 16 per cent respectively. Only two other constituencies saw an increase in this age group: Kildare South at 11 per cent and Cork North Central at 1 per cent.In Dublin, several constituencies have seen significant decreases with Dublin West, Dublin South West, Fingal and Dublin Mid-West seeing the under 35s population falling by 12 per cent, while Dublin North West has seen a 15 per cent decrease.The under 35s make up 22 per cent of the population and 29 per cent of those eligible to vote at the weekend.35-49In the 35-49 age bracket, the population has increased 7 per cent nationally and most constituencies have seen an increase in population with the most significant being in Dublin Central (41 per cent) Kildare South (34 per cent) Cavan-Monaghan (23 per cent) Dublin West (20 per cent) and Dublin Mid-West at 16 per cent.Sligo-Leitrim is the only constituency to see a decrease in this age category with a 4 per cent drop in population since 2011. Nationally the population of 35-49 year olds has increased 7 per cent.The 35-49 year old age group makes up 23 per cent of the population and 30 per cent of those eligible to vote.The last Ipsos MRBI poll showed increase in support for Sinn Féin was largely driven by voters aged 35-49 and Dublin voters. For Fine Gael, the most significant decline in preference for the party was recorded among 35-49 year olds (from 29 per cent to 18 per cent).50-64For the 50-64 age group, the most notable increases are again largely Leinster-based. This population group has seen its size increase by one-tenth since 2011 with Kildare South (43 per cent) having the largest increase among this age group also.This is followed by Dublin Central (41 per cent) Cavan-Monaghan (27 per cent) Dublin Fingal (16 per cent) and Dublin West (16 per cent). The 50-64-year-old age group make up 17 per cent of the population and 22\u0026nbspper cent of those eligible to vote.In the poll conducted earlier this week, Fianna Fáil remained the most popular party among the voters aged 50 or over, on 29 per cent.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165697.1581103476!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"psni releases photographs of bomb intended for irish sea ferry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolice  in Northern Ireland released images of the bomb on Friday. Photograph: PSNI Police in Northern Ireland have released images of the bomb which dissident republicans intended to detonate on an Irish Sea ferry as the UK left the EU last week. They show an explosive device, which is made up of a number of parts including wires and a pipe, attached to the underside of a lorry. It was discovered in Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan, Co Armagh, on Tuesday. PSNI Detective Superintendent Sean Wright said the images “demonstrate the sheer recklessness of those who knowingly put the driver, road users and the wider public at risk of death or serious injury.” He reissued a police appeal for information from anyone who was in the industrial estate between 4pm and 10pm on Friday, January 31st, or anyone who had dash-cam footage, to contact police “as a matter of urgency”. The PSNI believe the Continuity IRA was responsible for the attempt to bomb the ferry on January 31st. Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke said a call was made to a media outlet on January 31st to say that there was a bomb on the trailer of a lorry at Belfast port which was due to travel on the “midnight boat”. In a further call to a media outlet on Monday, the caller stated that the intention “had been for that device to explode on Friday evening around the time that the UK left the EU.” Police sources believe the bombers attached the device to the wrong trailer, which remained in the industrial estate for several days until it was discovered. The device was made safe by British army bomb experts. Nobody was injured.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire Leo Varadkar has predicted “real difficulty” in forming government after the election. “If the polls are correct, then I think we are going to have real difficulty forming a government,” he told Clare FM. He was speaking in Ennis as parties make their final pitches to voters as the final day of the campaign is under way ahead of polls opening on Saturday morning.“My fear is that a Fianna Fáil-led government or a Sinn Féin-led government - or the two of them in bed together. That could set us backwards, so people have a big decision to make.” Asked about predictions that Fine Gael is on course to lose 15 seats, Mr Varadkar stated: “Those predictions are going to be wrong.” “Any opinion polls that were taken were taken before the leaders’ TV debate on Tuesday which I think I did well in and before some of the controversies involving Sinn Féin that became major news.”Mr Varadkar also dismissed reports of Fine Gael party sources questioning the party’s electoral strategy.“I’m not going to attach any seriousness to anonymous comments from senior party sources. Anyone who has something to say they say it publicly quite frankly, so I’m not giving that any credence whatsoever.”Mr Varadkar also said he would fight to retain leadership of Fine Gael in the event of his party losing the general election. Under party rules he would have to submit himself to a confidence vote. “If that were to happen, I would ask to stay on as party leader and lead the Opposition, and be ready to pick up the pieces in five years time after Fianna Fáil do to the country what they usually do,” he said. On health, Mr Varadkar said he “deeply regrets” that anyone has to spend any time on a hospital trolley. “In a wealthy country like Ireland no-one should have to experience that, certainly their relatives should not have to either, and I know what it is like for the staff too.” But he said it is not true to say nothing was happening to fix the problems. The housing crisis has come up “in so many different way” during the election campaign, he accepted, saying issues ranged “from people who are paying rents that are far too high, to people in their thirties living at home who are trying to buy their first home, struggling to get a deposit, to the really sharp end of things which is families in emergency accommodation.”“But I actually, genuinely think we are making progress on this,” he said. Mr Varadkar said more houses are being built, house prices are levelling off, rents are going down and the number in emergency accommodation is falling back.Promises from other parties to double housing within a year “is not honest”, he added. Mr Varadkar said:“I think a vote for Fianna Fáil is a vote for Sinn Féin in this election.”“There is a lot of people now in Fianna Fáil- candidates all over the country - who have indicated in the past couple of weeks that they are open to coalition with Sinn Féin.”Fianna Fáil alternativeIn Cork, Micheál Martin has insisted that Fianna Fáil is the only party capable of offering an alternative government to the current Fine Gael led administration.Mr Martin told reporters that any negotiations with like-minded parties will be based on policy. He has ruled out going into coalition with either Sinn Féin or Fine Gael and acknowledged that he hopes to talk to parties such as the Greens, Labour and Social Democrats after the election on Saturday.But when asked if he would advise Fianna Fail supporters to give their lower preferences to potential coalition partners in the Greens, Labour or Social Democrats, he declined to do so.“I am never that prescriptive in terms of what people do with their preferences - no, I am saying to people that we obviously want to maximise our seats and to obviously vote Fianna Fáil,” he said.“People should vote in order of their choice after that but in terms of the formation of Government I think people are hearing what I am saying but I don’t ever get into a position where I direct people (how to transfer).”“I think they (Greens, Labour and Social Democrats) will do much better than people are expecting ... part of the narrative of the last week perhaps has been trying to write them out of the equation which may not materialise.“I think they will do reasonably well,” said Mr Martin during a canvass on Trinity Bridge in Cork city centre which he found himself sharing with Fine Gael’s Jerry Buttimer as they sought to catch people going to work.Mr Martin said that, beyond the Greens, Labour and Social Democrats, the issue of support from “like-minded independents” such as the Healy-Raes or Mattie McGrath would be strictly policy based.“Our position is that the people are looking to the political parties to be at the centre of a new Government. But the key is the policies and the key is the programme.Mr Martin refused to be drawn on how many seats Fianna Fáil might win but he said he was confident it would emerge from the contest as Ireland’s biggest political party.“I have never given a specific number - but we had a very good day in 2016 coming from where we were. Obviously we want to increase our number of seats again.”“Fianna Fáil has the realistic, do-able programme for a new Government - particularly in terms of urgent action on the health services and housing with the building of new council and affordable homes.”“In terms of climate change, education and children with special needs, we have imaginative, innovative ideas and solutions to that as well.”“All within sustainable financial parameter - and I think it is a do-able programme unlike others which are clearly not deliverable given the lack of any significant financial details in the programmes from other parties.”Polling stations open at 7am and close at 10pm. The Department of Housing says voters do not need a polling card but will need to bring identification. The  will publish an exit poll as soon as voting ends on Saturday night to give the first indication of the outcome of general election 2020. The poll, carried out by the ’ pollsters Ipsos MRBI, has been commissioned jointly by The , RTE, TG4 and UCD.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"harry mcgee s final seat prediction for election 2020","story":"There is an apocryphal quote that is often attributed to the late US president Lyndon Johnson about the vagaries of elections. After losing a particularly bitterly-fought election, he is reputed to have said: “The people have spoken, the bastards.” Predicting election campaigns in Ireland is a guessing game that sometimes presents itself as an inexact science. Opinion polls and the results of secondary elections such as council elections, byelections and European elections give you the direction of the wind. But the system we have in Ireland of multi-seat constituencies allied with transferable votes makes it a very difficult exercise to carry out with any degree of accuracy.No tally taken prior to voting could have told you that Bríd Smith of People Before Profit would win the last seat in Dublin South-Central in 2016, by less than 40 votes, from Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh, relying wholly on the distribution of a tiny surplus that had got Joan Collins over the line in a previous count.Usually, there are predictors. For this general election it was last year’s round of local and European elections, as well as the autumn opinion polls, plus the November byelections. But they have all been thrown out the window since the start of the campaign. In Lazarus fashion, Sinn Féin has confounded expectations and become the party for the strong prevailing mood of the electorate: and that is change. Nobody foresaw it, not even Sinn Féin. The party now lacks candidates in constituencies where it might have won a second seat. Fine Gael has tumbled down. Fianna Fáil looks like it’s treading water a bit but there might be a latent support there. Of the rest, only the Greens look stronger, but outside Dublin, they remain niche.The 33rd Dáil will have an extra two seats compared with the outgoing Dáil, bringing the total up to 160. That means extra seats in Cavan-Monaghan, Kildare South and Dublin Central. In addition, Laois and Offaly combine into one constituency, with five seats overall rather than six.Here is my tally, broken down by party and where I see they may gain some seats and lose others.1. Dublin Mid-West: This would be a technical gain as the party has no seat here after losing the byelection for Frances Fitzgerald’s former seat. Emer Higgins should safely take one seat out of four and the party might even consider itself in with a shout for a second seat, although that is a long shot.2. Cork North-Central: This is another technical gain as there is a vacant seat. Fine Gael has no seat there since Dara Murphy’s resignation in December. Colm Burke should easily win one seat for the party in the four-seat constituency.3. Tipperary:  The target is seat held by Independent Séamus Healy. Fine Gael has gone out on a limb by picking two new and relatively unknown candidates. It had a full quota in 2016 but terrible vote management and candidate selection lost it its seat. The party’s strong local election performance should provide it with the basis for a seat here at the expense of an Independent. Was it a mistake by Mary Newman Julian not to contest the local elections, unlike her running mate Garret Ahearn? Could they repeat the mistakes of 2016? The mood has darkened considerably here.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Fianna Fáíl already has two and is unlikely to win three. Sinn Féin has traditionally been not as strong in Cavan as in Monaghan. But the surge in the poll now means that Pauline Tully could edge out Fine Gael’s TP O’Reilly for the last seat. This would be a big body blow.5. Cork North-West: The target is a Fianna Fáil seat. A one-point increase needed in vote share compared with 2016. John Paul O’Shea ran as an Independent in 2016 and did well. Now under the Fine Gael banner will run Fianna Fáíl close.6. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. A two percentage-point increase in vote share is required compared with 2016. Again a close battle with Fianna Fáil looked in prospect to topple a precarious Sinn Féin seat. Pa O’Driscoll is based in the northern end of the constituency and while the teacher has a high profile and is a strong campaigner, he might struggle for transfers in the latter counts. On balance, it’s hard to see Sinn Féin not holding the seat, even though the party is not showing as strongly in Munster.7. Dublin-Rathdown: Shane Ross is the target. A five percentage-point increase in vote share required compared with 2016. Neale Richmond will need to put in a huge performance to create one of the shocks of the day by taking out Ross. And now, it is not only Ross but also Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan he has to worry about.8. Kerry: The target is a Sinn Féin seat. A five-point increase is required. The Sinn Féin seat is no longer in such danger. Fine Gael’s candidate Michael Kennelly comes from a well-known Listowel GAA family. Fianna Fáil looks marginally stronger though after the local elections but there is a neater geographical ide between Kennelly and sitting TD Brendan Griffin. May be moot now if Pa Daly can harness all of the Martin Ferris vote.9. Longford-Westmeath: The target is a Labour Party seat. Another ding-dong battle between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for a vulnerable seat, this time the one vacated by Labour’s Willie Penrose. It will boil down to be a bout between two Longford candidates. Fianna Fáíl is stronger in the constituency overall but Fine Gael is stronger in Longford (it won 39 per cent of the vote in last year’s local elections. Its candidate Micheál Carrigy has a high profile. A bellwether constituency. Don’t rule out Sinn Féin.10. Galway East: A five-point gain is required to take a seat off Seán Canney. This will be a local battle, between the outgoing Tuam Independent and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil rivals from the same area. Fine Gael’s Peter Roche performed strongly in the local elections but Fianna Fáil had a big day in Tuam, taking four out of seven. Again very, very tight. But on opinion poll evidence you would have to favour Fianna Fáil, or even Canney holding.11. Louth: A two-point increase is required. The target is Independent Peter Fitzpatrick. Fine Gael has only one seat here after Fitzpatrick’s resignation from the party in 2018. Dundalk-based councillor John McGahon will be one of five jousting for the last seat and might just come up short.12. Limerick City: The target is a Labour seat. A five-point rise on 2016 is required. Others, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, look stronger in the battle for the final seat with Jan O’Sullivan.1. Dún Laoghaire: to Fianna FáilGreens. A certainty. Fine Gael holds three seats out of four because outgoing ceann comhairle Seán Barrett was automatically returned in 2016. He is not standing this time. The party won 25 per cent of the vote in 2016. Now it’s looking at the dismal scenario of returning only one seat here.2. Dublin North-West: to Fianna Fáíl. Probability is high. Noel Rock is a very doughty campaigner but he is up against it this time. He narrowly saw off Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe in 2016 but his rival is in a much stronger position now, and Fianna Fáil had a very strong local election here. Sinn Féin has been on the slide here but it would be hard to see Dessie Ellis’s fall being so dramatic as to lose.3. Galway West: to Greens or Fianna Fáil. Probability is medium to high. Like Clare the party managed to retain two seats with only 24 per cent of the vote, and relied heavily on Labour transfers. Its two TDs, Seán Kyne and Hildegarde Naughton, are high profile but would need to increase the party’s share of the vote against parties whose support levels are rising.4. Dublin Bay South: to the Labour Party. Probability low to medium. The second Fine Gael seat could be in play here if Labour’s Kevin Humphreys gains traction. A strong Green performance could also impact. If the  opinion poll for Fine Gael is correct, this might make one of its seats in this “true blue” constituency vulnerable.5. Wexford:  to Independent or Sinn Féin. Paul Kehoe clung on in 2016 will face a challenge again. Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen performed well in the recent byelection and the party is flying in the polls. Verona Murphy’s candidacy could also have an impact on Kehoe.6. Clare: to IndependentFianna Fáíl. The party won less votes than Fianna Fáíl in 2016 but still managed to retain both seats thanks to Labour transfers. Fianna Fáil seems to have a very strong ticket and should win a second seat. The decision by Michael Harty not to run will be a boon to it. Fine Gael’s only vulnerability is losing to another Independent candidate in the shape of Michael McNamara.7. Dublin South-Central: to GreensFianna Fáil. Catherine Byrne has survived here against all the odds but this might be one election too many. Fianna Fáíl looks strong for a seat as do the Greens. Something will have to give and it could be Fine Gael.8. Meath East: to Sinn Féin. Darren O’Rourke was not all that far away in 2016 and will not be all that far away this time either. Many of those who live on the Dublin side of the constituency are commuters who are one of the big groups clamouring for change. Regina Doherty’s seat, in particular, is vulnerable.1. Dún Laoghaire: There is an extra seat. Needs a one per cent increase in vote share compared with the 2016 general election. Last time out this was a three-seater because outgoing Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett was a TD. Fianna Fáil do have a quota so should pick up a seat. It is running two candidates, Mary Hanafin and Cormac Devlin\u0026nbspand there is a danger they could cancel each other out. The Greens look strong for a seat here.2. Dublin North-West: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Needs a one per cent rise in support from the 2016 general election. Finglas-based Paul McAuliffe topped the poll amid a strong Fianna Fáil performance in the local elections and is current Lord Mayor. Fine Gael’s Noel Rock relied hugely on Labour transfers to pip him last time out and he looks very vulnerable.3. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Needs a five percentage-point increase since 2016: This moves from a three- to four-seat constituency. Mary Fitzpatrick would need to add five points to her 11 per cent showing in 2016 though she performed very strongly in her own electoral area in the local elections. Mary Lou McDonald will top the poll and the Greens also look as if they they may pip Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats.4. Dublin South-Central: One per cent increase required compared with 2016. Target is Independent or People Before Profit seats, or perhaps Fine Gael. Catherine Ardagh lost out by less than 40 votes in 2016. She has had a high profile since as her party’s leader in the Seanad and Fianna Fáil did well in the local elections. Only seat safe here is Sinn Féin and she is an odds-on favourite to regain the seat once held by her late father, Seán Ardagh. Sinn Féin would have won two seats here if it ran two candidates.5. Clare: Target is an Independent or Fine Gael seat. Two percentage-point rise required since 2016: Fine Gael’s second seat here was very vulnerable until Independent Michael Harty announced he would not contest the election. Fianna Fáil seems to have got its formula right. Cathal Crowe is a strong candidate who did himself no harm with his boycott of the proposed Royal Irish Constabulary event. It had five per cent more votes at 30 per cent than Fine Gael in 2016 but won only seat, while its rival won two. It looks as if Fine Gael will be the loser here, with Independent and former Labour TD Michael McNamara and Green Róisín Garvey in the hunt for the fourth seat.6. Galway East: Target is an Independent seat held by Seán Canney: Six percentage-point increase needed compared with 2016: Tuam is going to be the battleground here. Canney is defending a seat he won handily. The other two seats are in the southeastern Loughrea-Portumna axis held by Anne Rabbitte of Fianna Fáil and in the Athenry-GortKinvara southern axis held by Fine Gael’s Ciarán Cannon. The Independent brand around Tuam, so strong from 2014-2016, receded in last year’s local elections. Fine Gael has chosen a strong councillor, Peter Roche who topped the poll in Tuam. But Fianna Fáil won four out of seven council seats in Tuam, and that might give it an edge. It has chosen Cllr Donagh Killilea, a son of the late TD and MEP Mark Killilea. He’s come late into the race though but at this stage he might be ahead of Roche. Don’t underestimate Canney.7. Kerry: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. An eight percentage-point increase needed here from 2016. Sinn Féin was vulnerable but not any more. Fianna Fáil had very good local elections and the addition of Tralee councillor Norma Foley gives it a very strong ticket and may dent the impact Michael Healy-Rae had in the northern part of the constituency in 2016. Norma Moriarty is comfortably placed in the Iveragh Peninsula in the south while sitting TD John Brassil is from Ballyheigue, geographically close to Foley. Fine Gael has a strong Listowel-based councillor Mike Kennelly as its second candidate. But Pa Daly, seen as a beaten docket a month ago, is now back in the frame for Sinn Féin.8. Longford-Westmeath: Target is a Labour seat. Seven percentage-point increase needed from 2016: Fianna Fáil is the largest party in the entire constituency but the last seat may turn out to be a battle between Fianna Fáíl’s Joe Flaherty and Micheál Carrigy for the “Longford” seat, a county in which Fine Gael is stronger. And now Sorca Clarke of Sinn Féin has moved into view.9. Carlow-Kilkenny: The target is a Sinn Féin or Fine Gael seat and a two percentage-point increase is required. Winning three out of five seats is always a massive task and if Fianna Fáíl pulls it off here, it will be well on its way to government. John McGuinness and Bobby Aylward ided the Kilkenny vote very well last time. Sinn Féin’s Kathleen Funchion is no longer vulnerable. Fianna Fáil’s Carlow candidate Jennifer Murnane O’Connor came very close in 2016 and could get over the line this time. But will it be at the expense of Pat Deering of Fine Gael, or of her running mate, Aylward?10. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. Four percentage-point increase required since 2016. Another Sinn Féin TD, Pat Buckley, looked like facing a challenge following a poor local election for the party in Co Cork but now is seen as safe, even though the Sinn Féin vote is not as strong in Munster. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s second candidates had only a handful of votes separating them the last time around. The party’s second candidates are at opposite ends of the constituency. It’s now marginal.11. Laois-Offaly: A Fine Gael seat is the target. A four percentage-point increase in required. It is a Fianna Fáil heartland and Fine Gael’s Marcella Corcoran Kennedy had a middling vote in 2016. However, Fine Gael did well in locals and it would be a tall order for Fianna Fáil to win three out of five here. Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin remains strong in Portlaoise.12. Louth: A Sinn Féin or Independent seat is the target. A nine point increase is needed. Fianna Fáil could have a higher percentage of votes than Fine Gael but might struggle with getting enough transfers to bring the party over the line. Its second candidate, James Byrne, is based in Drogheda where there is already a number of strong candidates. Sinn Féin now looks as if it will hold on to two which would make it a tricky proposition for Byrne to join Declan Breathnach in the Dáíl.13. Kildare South: An extra seat. A four percentage-point increase is required. An effective three-seater because Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl was elected here. Fianna Fáil won two out of three in 2016 when it was actually a three-seater but a taller order this time as Mark Wall of Labour could sneak in. Suzanne Doyle is a high-profile running mate for sitting TD Fiona O’Loughlin and there is potential there. But it’s less straightforward than 2016. Fiona McLoughlin Healy and Cathal Berry are two Independents, one of whom might spring a surprise.14. Dublin South-West: The target is an Independent seat. Fianna Fáil got a quota here in 2016 and would need an eight-point increase in first-preference votes plus good vote management to win a second seat. However, candidate Charlie O’Connor had a mammoth local election in Tallaght and could squeeze through in a big field at the expense of Katherine Zappone or Paul Murphy.15. Dublin Fingal: The target is a Fine Gael seat. A five percentage-point boost is needed. On paper the party has a chance here of taking a second seat after getting 1.4 quotas in 2016. However, the Greens will now need to take it in a scenario where Fine Gael is winning no seats. A very tall order.16. Galway West: A five percentage-point increase is required. Fianna Fáil won more votes here than Fine Gael in 2016 but still returned only one TD. One of the Fine Gael TDs could be vulnerable but the disparity between Eamon Ó Cuív’s votes, and his running mates’ have always been too high. Against that, the party had a good local election in the city, and Ollie Crowe is an experienced candidate. His chances are remote though given the crowded field, and the strengths of other newish candidates such as Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats, Pauline O’Reilly of the Green Party, and (perhaps) Mairéad Farrell of Sinn Féin.17. Limerick City: A Labour Party seat is the target. Fianna Fáil has a strong ticket in Willie O’Dea and James Collins, a cousin of Niall’s. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlivan looked on shaky ground a month ago but no more. Jan O’Sullivan might be more precarious.18. Dublin Rathdown: The target is the Independent Seat. An eight-point increase over 2016 is required. This was going to be the only constituency in the country where Fianna Fáíl had no seat. But in the last week, Shay Brennan has been talked up as a possible challenger for Shane Ross’s seat, which has come as a huge surprise.1. Wicklow: Could miss out to Greens, Social Democrats or Independents. Stephen Donnelly won almost 21 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but as a Social Democrat. With 13 per cent of the vote in 2016, Fianna Fáil would need to add at least 9 per cent to have any chance of taking a second seat. The big unknown is how Donnelly’s vote will be impacted by him being a Fianna Fáil candidate. It will certainly be a negative drag despite his profile as his party’s health spokesman. Valerie Cox’s candidacy will not be a help.3. Sligo-Leitrim: Again Fianna Fáil won two out of four here on 32 per cent of the vote. Fine Gael had a good local election in Sligo but Fianna Fáil is still a little stronger. Marian Harkin’s entry into the race has upset all that planning. If she knocks out a sitting TD, the most likely is one of the two Fianna Fáil deputies. But there is a scenario where Fine Gael – which again messed up its candidate strategy here – could end up with zero seats.4. Kildare North: Could lose to Greens or Labour Party. Fianna Fáil won the second seat here on the back of a lowish first preference. The Green Party candidate, Vincent P Martin, might pose a threat, as might Labourveteran Emmet Stagg. Now Sinn Féin could also be a player here. On balance, it could be a hold, especially if vote management remains as disciplined as it was in 2016.5. Roscommon-Galway: Fianna Fáil is potentially vulnerable to Fine Gael in the only constituency where it has no representation. Fine Gael’s Aisling Dolan is based in Ballinasloe and not widely known in Roscommon. Fine Gael had a poor local election in Roscommon. Besides Denis Naughten is still regarded as proxy Fine Gael. It will be interesting to see if the addition of the high-profile Órla Leyden will affect the dynamic between herself and sitting TD, Eugene Murphy. On balance, a hold.6. Dublin Bay South: Labour poses a threat. Jim O’Callaghan got elected with just over half a quota in 2016. He has been helped by having a high profile but if he fails to add to his first preferences, he might find Labour’s Kevin Humphreys breathing down his neck. He relied a lot on transfers from Chris Andrews of Sinn Féin in 2016 and may not get as many. The absence of Michael McDowell from the slate will help his cause. Very unlikely to lose.1. Donegal: Target is an Independent seat. It needs a one-point increase in vote share over 2016. Pádraig Mac Lochlainn narrowly lost out to Thomas Pringle in 2016 using an ill-advised three-candidate strategy. This time there is just two candidates and the party has high hopes it can win back its second seat. Will be tight though.2. Dublin West: Target is Labour PartyS-PBP. A two percentage point increase needed over 2016. Paul Donnelly has been knocking on the door in Dublin West and was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate in 2016. However, Sinn Féin did not have a great local election but it is in constituencies like this that it has a gale wind behind it. Ruth Coppinger looks in real trouble, as does Labour. A certain win.3. Wexford: Target is Fine Gael. A two-point increase is needed. Another constituency where Sinn Féin came close to winning a seat in 2016. There have been mixed messages this year, a poor local election and a slightly better byelection performance. However, the momentum has returned and Johnny Mythen might be the fit. He is located to the north of the constituency which might be a handicap.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six-point increase is needed. This is one of the few constituencies where Sinn Féin has the potential to win a second seat. Cavan has always been a bit of a challenge for it but this time Pauline Tully is highly experienced and has a chance alongside Matt Carthy.5. Mayo: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Rose Conway-Walsh is an excellent Senator but always seemed to be coming up a little short in Mayo. But the surge in party support will certainly make her a contender here, and if she is ahead of the Greens’ Saoirse McHugh, which is likely, her transfers might push the Sinn Féin candidate over the line.6. Longford-Westmeath: A new planet is discovered in the galaxy. Sorca Clarke was seen as a mid-table finisher until a fortnight ago but now Sinn Féin can challenge in this constituency. I still see the final seat going to either Fianna Fáíl or Fine Gael.1. Dublin Mid-West: to Fine Gael. This was almost certain before the campaign started but the party will now be in the mix to retain its two TDs in this four-seat constituency. Its challenge will be to stay ahead of Gino Kenny, the Greens and Paul Gogarty.2. Louth: to the Labour Party. Possibility is medium to low. The party always had a tall order on its hands retaining two seats in Louth following Gerry Adams’s retirement. And while it won more than 24 per cent of the vote in the local elections, it needs a higher volume of number ones to compensate for lack of transfers. A fortnight ago, I would have said No. Now, I would say it has a good chance of holding.3. Cork East: to Fianna FáilFine Gael. This a bit of long shot. Pat Buckley looked a goner last May after the party bombed in the locals. But it’s bounced back and so has he. While Sinn Féin not showing up as highly in Munster, he can ward off the challenge from Fianna Fáíl and Fine Gael.Other constituencies: I had another eight constituencies marked as potential losses for Sinn Féin. But that was a fortnight ago. And the world has changed since then.1. Louth: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. A two percentage-point increase is needed compared with 2016. Despite coming out of government, Labour very narrowly lost a number of seats and this was one of them. Ged Nash will be buoyed by the party’s strong showing in its stronghold of Drogheda and is in contention to take a seat, although it will be a scrap.2. Dublin Bay North: The party is targeting seats vacated by Independents. A two-point increase in vote share is needed. This constituency is always unpredictable because of the huge number of candidates. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s passage to regain a seat is helped hugely by the retirements of Finian McGrath and Tommy Broughan. If he does not win, Labour can pack up and call it a day.3. Kildare South: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six point increase is needed. The addition of a seat will favour Mark Wall to take a position once held by his father, Jack. However, he needs to spread his support beyond his Athy base and may be vulnerable to Fianna Fáil’s Suzanne Doyle, or an asymmetric challenge from two strong Independents.4. Cork North-Central: Target is Solidarity-People Before Profit. Five per cent increase needed compared to 2016 election. Solidarity’s Mick Barry will struggle to recapture 15 per cent of the vote from 2016 but will not lose his seat easily. Labour’s John Maher performed well in the byelections and has established a profile after winning a council seat. Labour has not really recovered fully here after being floored in 2016. Maher may be in contention for the last seat but confidence has ebbed a little since start of campaign.5. Waterford:  Target is an Independent seat. A four-point increase is required. With John Halligan’s resignation, there will be a spare seat here. The big parties each have one seat and Labour looks the best placed of the small parties to benefit, through John Pratt. He will have to fend off Marc Ó Cathasaigh of the Greens who are growing here but also – more immediately – Cllr Matt Shanahan, the Independent who has led the high-profile campaign to improve services at Waterford hospital. Pratt may be behind the curve a little here.6. Dublin South-Central: Target is Fine GaelPeople Before Profit. A four percentage-point boost is needed. Like Dublin Bay North, this constituency will involve a scramble for the last seat. If Labour stays ahead of Greens and other left-leaning candidates, Rebecca Moynihan could come close. She is a very impressive candidate but it’s a slightly long shot.7. Kildare North:  Target is Fianna Fáil. A four-point increase is needed. Veteran Emmet Stagg was not that far away in 2016. He will need to stay ahead of the Greens and then rely on heavy transfers from them. Marginal.8. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat here. A five-point increase is needed. Another veteran Joe Costello is the Labour standard bearer and will be in the mix in the final shake-up. Might not happen this time though. Unlikely.9. Dún Laoghaire: Cllr Juliet O’Connell has had an impressive breakthrough year after getting elected as a councillor last year. She’s still comparatively new though and might suffer a slight profile deficit, given her late entry into the race. It must not be forgotten Labour held a seat here for many years but to win she would really have to dislodge Richard Boyd Barrett, who holds the sole left-wing seat in the constituency. Very slim chance.1. Longford-Westmeath: Potential loss to Fine GaelFianna Fáil. Possibility is high. Willie Penrose is retiring having defied all odds, and laws of gravity, in 2016. It’s hard to see Labour retaining this seat even though former county footballer, Alan Mangan, has a high profile.2. Dublin West: to Green PartySinn Féin. Possibility is high. The Greens look poised to win a seat here, with Fine Gael seeking a second seat, and Sinn Féin is also poised to take a seat at the expense of Ruth Coppinger. Joan Burton held the seat here in 2016 against the odds but you sense the tide might have run out on her.3. Limerick City:  Jan O’Sullivan looked comparatively safe until Sinn Féin managed to get back on the pitch. If Fianna Fáíl gets a second seat here it could be at her expense. She survived in 2016 and she is likely to survive again.1. Dún Laoghaire: Extra seat. A 10-point boost is needed. If the party does not win a seat here, there will be no Green surge. It had a big local election here and should win its first seat in the constituency.2. Dublin West: Target is LabourSolidarity Party. An eight-point increase is required. Green Party chairman Roderic O’Gorman has been its candidate here for some time now and is expected to win a seat on the back of a really strong local election performance by him and colleagues.3. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. An eight-point rise is required. The party was nowhere here in 2016 but again the momentum is with it after the local elections in a constituency where it did particularly well. David Healy won’t get it easy though and will have to fight it out with the Social Democrats, Independent John Lyons, and Labour for two seats.4. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A seven percentage-point increase is needed. The party did well in both local election areas with Ciarán Cuffe topping the poll in the north inner city. Its leader on Dublin City Council Neasa Hourigan is the candidate. She is impressive. She seems slightly ahead of Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats in the race for the final seat.5. Dublin South-West: Target is an Independent seat. An eight-point increase is needed. The party will have an impact on Fine Gael and the Independent Minister Katherine Zappone. It elected councillors comfortably in all the middle-class areas of the constituency and Cllr Francis Noel Duffy (the husband of deputy leader Catherine Martin) is favoured to take a seat.6. Cork South-Central: Target is Sinn Féin. A six point boost is required. Lorna Bogue will need to mount a huge challenge to dislodge Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for the last seat in a constituency of heavy hitters Micheál Martin, Michael McGrath and Simon Coveney are the other TDs. She is very much on the left of the party and will compete for transfers from smaller groups and left-leaning Independents.7. Wicklow:  Target is Fianna FáilFine Gael. A six-point increase is needed. The party is hardly above five per cent in Wicklow but can benefit from transfers in a constituency where there are always multiple candidates. Fianna Fáil (Stephen Donnelly) and Sinn Féin votes are both expected to drop somewhat and the Green candidate Steven Matthews had an impressive haul of votes in the locals last year. With so many candidates, including Valerie Cox, it might be too big an ask.8. Galway West:  Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A six-point increase in vote share from 2016 is required. Pauline O’Reilly is a strong candidate who will be in the mix after the party had a good local elections in Galway City and in Connemara. The question is how strong the vote will be outside the city. She is also competing against Catherine Connolly for votes who is very strong in the city. There is also the impressive Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell is now back in the frame. No certainty at all.9. Waterford: Target is an Independent seat. A six-point increase is required. There is a seat for the taking by a smaller party in Waterford with Halligan standing down. Former senator Grace O’Sullivan would have been a strong favourite if she had not run for Europe. Her replacement Marc Ó Cathasaigh will need to battle hard to break through against a strong challenge from Labour and from Matt Shanahan. He might just snatch it.10. Kildare North: Target is Fianna Fáíl. A seven-point increase in vote share is required. A commuter constituency where the Greens made a big breakthrough in the local elections winning three seats on the council. Naas-based Vincent P Martin, brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin, is a smooth campaigner and will give Fianna Fáíl a run for its money in the battle for the last seat.11. Louth: Target is Independent. A five-point increase of vote share is required. There were high hopes a decade ago that Mark Dearey might make a breakthrough for the Greens here. The former senator is a popular figure but would need to double the party’s vote in the constituency.12. Clare: This is another constituency which has seen a candidate or party emerge out of nowhere. There’s definitely a seat for an Independent or smaller party here following the retirement of Michael Harty. Róisín Garvey is a straight-talking west Clare woman who has made a big impact and will be vying with Michael McNamara for that seat.1. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A one-point increase is needed. Gary Gannon changed local electoral areas in the locals and was comfortably elected. He came very close in 2016, enjoys a high profile and will be in a battle with the Greens, Fianna Fáil and Labour for one of the final two seats here.2. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependents. Another very solid Social Democrats performer is Cian O’Callaghan. The forward momentum of the Greens and John Lyons might stymie his chances though.3. Galway West: Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A five-point increase in vote share required. Niall Ó Tuathail was another Social Democrats’ star in 2016 with a strong showing in Galway West. Has he maintained the progress? Some would consider it ill advised for him not to have contested the local election. Council seats are seen as springboards for national politics. Still in with a strong chance.4. Wicklow: Target is Fianna Fáil. Jennifer Whitmore had a very good local election and topped the poll in Greystones, Donnelly’s stomping ground. He got 20 per cent last time when he ran for the Social Democrats. But a lot of that was a personal vote. Wicklow can be very unpredictable. Nobody knows how well Donnelly will do flying under the Fianna Fáil banner. Valerie Cox is an unknown quantity. Whitmore could very well be in contention for the final seat if she manages to capitalise on her local election performance.1. Cork North-Central: to Labour Party. Mick Barry had 15 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but the signs in the local elections, and in the recent byelection, were ominous. He is going to struggle but his vote will certainly be higher than the locals suggested. Facing threats from Labour and, possibly, the Greens.2. Dublin South-Central: to Fianna Fáil. Bríd Smith won with only a handful of votes to spare in 2016 and could be vulnerable this time to Fianna Fáil, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour. Some see this as a battle between her and Joan Collins in that left-wing space, even though both are based in different parts of the constituency.3. Dubin Mid-West: to IndependentGreens or Sinn Féin. Gino Kenny came from nowhere to win a seat in 2016 and this popular and sincere TD might just hang on, partly on the back of his championing medicinal cannabis, which has given him a national profile. There are two left-wing seats in the constituency, and Sinn Féin is now looking to win a second. Another threat will come from an Independent candidate, possibly Paul Gogarty.4. Dublin West: Vulnerable to Sinn Féin. Ruth Coppinger has been an indefatigable worker and has a national profile. But so do the other TDs, Leo Varadkar, Burton and Jack Chambers. Her seat is under huge threat.5. Dún Laoghaire: To Fianna Fáil or the Greens. There has always been a left-wing seat in this constituency, and Richard Boyd Barrett might just hold on to it. However, that would mean getting in ahead of one of the two big parties, or the Greens.6. Dublin South-West: to Fianna Fail or Greens. It’s very hard to predict how Paul Murphy will fare, in his new role as the sole Rise TD in the Dáil. He did very well in 2016 on the back of the water protests but might find it difficult to maintain his support levels in the constituency. The decision by Solidarity to run Sandra Fay against her former party colleagues sounds ludicrous and could have an adverse impact on him. Both are running under the S-PBP banner.1. Dublin Mid-West (Paul Gogarty): Target is People Before Profit. Gogarty could take the fourth seat on the back of a reasonably good outing in the byelection.2. Sligo-Leitrim (Marian Harkin): Target is Fianna Fáil. The former MEP and TD has a very big cachet in the constituency and was wooed by Fine Gael. That offer might play a bit against her but she will be a threat to Fianna Fáíl.3. Wexford (Verona Murphy): Target is Fine Gael. Murphy is as well-known as she is controversial and early in the campaign was seen poised to take a seat at the expense of Paul Kehoe. However, Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen might top the poll and that might put paid to her chances.4. Clare (Michael McNamara): Target is IndependentFine Gael. There is an outgoing Independent TD, Michael Harty, who is retiring. Clare has a tradition of electing Independents and it might prove lucky for the former Labour Party TD.5. Waterford (Matt Shanahan): The “hospital candidate” has a very high profile locally and loss of hospital services is always a touchstone issue. Shanahan is in with a chance and will be vying with the Greens and Labour for the final seat.5. Dublin Bay North (John Lyons): The former People Before Profit councillor has an excellent track record on Dublin City Council and could cause an upset here against one of the three smaller left-leaning parties vying for the final seat.1. Laois-Offaly (Carol Nolan): Laois and Offaly were two separate three-seat constituencies in 2016. Now, it’s a five-seater and former Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan could be the obvious loser.2. Tipperary (Seamus Healy): to Fine Gael. Healy has been a great survivor but a change of mood might see him struggle.3. Donegal (Thomas Pringle): to Sinn Féin. Pringle has also been a solid vote-getter but Sinn Féin has been working really hard since 2016 to regain a seat.4. Galway East (Seán Canney): to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Canney is a Minister of State and a hard constituency worker but will find it hard to resist the two bigger parties. His best hope is to stay ahead of their Tuam-based candidates.5. Dublin South-West (Katherine Zappone): to GreensFianna Fáil.Very hard to gauge how the Minister for Children will do. She benefitted from anti-establishment transfers in 2016 but may be able to trade on her performance as Minister with another set of voters.6. Dublin Rathdown (Shane Ross): to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil: This is a very fickle constituency and this year’s poll topper is next year’s also-ran. Ross’s star has been waning here and his is under strong pressure from Neale Richmond and (surprisingly) Shay Brennan. However, he seems a little stronger now than at this time last year, having considerably upped his performance as Minister.8. Louth (Peter Fitzpatrick): to Fine Gael. It’s hard to know how the Independent TD, formerly of Fine Gael, will do without a party banner. He is the chairman of Louth GAA this year and that is always a boon.

Photograph: Lauren CrothersThe For all the years Sinn Féin was considered a party of outcasts back in Ireland, it was often met with a more sympathetic and financially lucrative welcome in the US and New York, in particular.It’s city where a isive “England Get Out of Ireland” banner is paraded down Fifth Avenue every year during the St Patrick’s Day Parade – Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald posed with it at last year’s event.The party’s official US fundraising arm, Friends of Sinn Féin, works to involve people in its efforts towards a united Ireland and has raised millions of euro in the process.For some Irish-Americans here, the party’s polling performance ahead of Saturday’s election was long overdue.Dan Sugrue, smoking a cigarette outside Sean Óg’s pub in the Irish enclave of Woodside, Queens, didn’t skip a beat when asked if there’s a political party back in Ireland that he leans toward.Mr Sugrue was born in New York but is from Donegal and Kerry stock, and owns a house in Donegal with his brothers. He said he’s always kept a close eye on the political situation in Ireland, and believes Sinn Féin’s recent spike in the polls is attributable to the failure of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to prosecute those responsible for the collapse of the banking and property sectors a decade ago.“When Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil got in cahoots together and then the economic crash happened and the bankers got off scot free by and large, since they had a coalition government they had to pay a price for it. So of course now alternate parties like Sinn Féin suddenly look like a viable change to it,” he said.“The Donegal crew more than likely” would be voting for Sinn Féin on Saturday, he said of his family back in Ireland.At other popular Woodside haunts such as O’Donovan’s or the Halfway Line, which broadcast the last few minutes of Tuesday night’s debate between Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, apathy was a fairly common theme among Irish drinkers, punctuated by several unprintable takes on the parties. Nearby at the Dugout, at which an IRA flag hangs above the bar, one patron from Co Mayo spoke of his support for Sinn Féin, who “never got a chance” before.For the years when it was seen by many in Ireland as a political pariah, Sinn Féin could always rely on donors in the US for funding, and endorsements by the likes of former US president Bill Clinton factors that former Noraid director Martin Galvin described as “instrumental” in keeping the party’s profile alive.“The profile, the campaigning for Sinn Féin to be able to come to the US for years, that led to a visa for Gerry Adams – all of that work. And just keeping a united Ireland on the agenda I think that was perfect,” Mr Galvin said.He said there is “a nationalism” that has been forged in the wake of the Brexit vote and Ireland’s economic and Border issues being considered “an afterthought” in that process that has elevated Sinn Féin as a viable contender for voters.Richard Lawlor, the national vice chairman of Noraid (Irish Northern Aid Committee), has been with the fundraising organisation for more than 40 years. His most visit to Ireland was in October and Sinn Féin’s recent rise in the polls was a “minor” surprise for him.“We’ve seen all these amazingly negative press and negative political feelings and obviously most especially in the North but also in the South against Sinn Féin and against that I’ve seen them nevertheless act with tremendous integrity and actually bring forth a new generation of very talented young people ready to assume office and lead Ireland to a much better place,” Mr Lawlor said.During his last visit to Ireland, Mr Lawlor said Sinn Féin was “demonised” by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail for years, along with the media, which he said was “almost an arm of the government.”Mr Lawlor said Noraid’s activities these days are less on fundraising, which used to be on behalf of political prisoners, and focuses more on “educational and political components.”“There’s no question we would be close to Sinn Féin, because those are the people we worked with through thick or thin for all these years,” he said. “We’re delighted to see their rise and we believe it was well earned over very difficult odds.”Friends of Sinn Féin did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165717.1581106000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democratic candidates gear up in advance of first primary contest","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: seeking to gather momentum for his candidacy in New Hampshire. Photograph:  Spencer PlattGetty Democratic presidential candidates will intensify their campaigns in New Hampshire this weekend ahead of the nation’s first primary contest on Tuesday.The New England state – which, unlike Iowa, runs a primary rather than a caucus – will see eligible Democratic voters choose their candidate to become the party’s nominee a week after voters in Iowa cast their vote in a chaotic process.With results of all precincts in Iowa released, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg was declared the winner, narrowly edging out Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in terms of state delegate equivalents – a metric used to calculate the number of delegates the state will send to the Democratic National Convention in Milkwaukee in July. \u0026nbspMr Sanders won the popular vote, however, leading him to also claim victory.Mr Buttigieg led the field with 26.2 per cent of delegates, according to the final results, just ahead of Mr Sanders at 26.1 per cent. Elizabeth Warren came in at 18 per cent, with former vice-president Joe Biden at 15.8 per cent.The Associated Press announced that Mr Buttigieg won 12 of the state delegates, with 11 for Mr Sanders, Ms Warren at 8 and Mr Biden at six.The unexpected victory for Mr Buttigieg, who benefited from a strong campaign in Iowa and a moderate political stance that resonated with caucus goers in the midwestern state, gave the 38-year-old former mayor a boost in polling numbers in New Hampshire. Buttigieg and SandersA new Boston Globe – WBX – Suffolk University poll released late on Thursday put Mr Buttigieg in a virtual tie with Mr Sanders, who had been well ahead in most New Hampshire polls. While Mr Sanders was still ahead on 24 per cent, his younger rival was at 23 per cent, up from 11 per cent – a 12-point jump in four days. A Monmouth University poll on Thursday, however, put Mr Sanders comfortably ahead at 24 per cent, with Mr Buttigieg placed second, Mr Biden in third place, and Massachusetts senator Ms Warren in fourth.The top candidates were due to take part in a CNN debate in the New Hampshire capital of Manchester on Friday night.As well as the four top-polling candidates, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, tech executive Andrew Yang and billionaire candidate Tom Steyer were also due to take part in the final debate before Tuesday’s vote.Mr Biden in particular is under pressure to perform well given his disappointing performance in Iowa. The former vice-president has been the front-runner in national polls but finished in fourth place in the Iowa caucuses.The Iowa Democratic Party continued to face sharp criticism on Friday, five days after its highly anticipated caucuses ended in disarray.Precinct resultsWith state officials reporting difficulties transmitting precinct results to headquarters via an app that had been developed specifically for the vote, and special hotlines clogged, the Iowa Democratic Party reported its final tallies almost five days late. Even then, questions were raised about irregularities in the reporting process, casting into doubt the state’s future as the first state to vote in presidential primary contests.Democratic candidates have until noon on Monday to call for a recanvass or recount.Meanwhile, speaking as he left Washington for an event in North Carolina, President Donald Trump said the House of Representatives should “expunge” his impeachment because it was a “total political hoax”. But asked about his comments, House speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed them.“They can’t do that,” she told reporters.Mr Trump was speaking as new figures showed the US economy continued to strengthen.The US labour department said 225,000 jobs were added in January, while wages rose 3.1 per cent year on year."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Don\u0026#39t blame our beleaguered bobbies on the beat for Britain\u0026#39s surging crimeMore than 25,000 dementia patients sectioned in past five years amid warnings they are being locked up to \u0026#39control\u0026#39 their behaviourSenior Tories form group dubbed the \u0026#39Wolverines\u0026#39 to oppose Huawei and call on MPs to express concerns over 5G dealHolidaymakers face \u0026#39lucky dip\u0026#39 for blue passports until burgundy ones run outComment: Fixing the Supreme Court should be Boris Johnson\u0026#39s constitutional prioritySpain has forgotten its poor and is living in the past, says UN envoyDisappointed Mexicans told they can no longer take home the presidential planeKate steps up: The making of a future QueenLife drawing model Chloe Smith tipped for promotion in Cabinet reshuffleScottish fans plan protest against Brexit during clash with England at MurrayfieldEx-professional Pakistani cricketer and two associates jailed for trying to fix matches Firefighters come to Joe Biden\u0026#39s rescue in New Hampshire after Iowa \u0026#39gut punch\u0026#39 knocks his presidential bidFrance will take lead on deterrence as EU\u0026#39s only nuclear power after Brexit, says Emmanuel MacronPrince Harry opens up about mental health therapy at exclusive JP Morgan event in Miami in first public appearance since leaving the royal familyCoronation Street, 10,000th episode review: is Ken Barlow quitting the cobbles?Rabbits should only be sold in pairs to combat loneliness, say vetsRebecca Long-Bailey proposes French-style ban on bosses calling home after workComment: If Boris loses his bottle now, he will pay for it laterSledge and flag used by Ernest Shackleton on South Pole trip made subject of export ban by government Convicted terrorist released early ahead of emergency laws intended to toughen up the rules We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2020/02/07/TELEMMGLPICT000223965193_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWOvB85KFHbhcS6uFXAY7PboCeyLMA2AHU-q9982KOn8.jpeg?imwidth","title":"chinas struggle contain coronavirus has exploded myth prosperity","story":"For 30 years China’s combination of market economics with Maoist politics has confounded sceptics - no longer The ancient Persians threw the bearers of bad news down wells. Modern China prefers to silence them.The death of Dr Li Wenliang, the brave young doctor who fell foul of the Communist authorities for trying to alert his colleagues to the emergence of a new public health threat in Wuhan province, offers a sad insight into contemporary China.For 30 years China’s combination of market economics with Maoist politics has confounded sceptics who argued that there could be no successful free market without political freedom. It seemed that a one party dictatorship deploying ever more sophisticated high tech social controls could manage to let a hundred business sectors bloom without any free-thinking flowers springing up alongside them. Yet the public health crisis which started in Wuhan at the end of last year has put a sharp spotlight on the cruel realities of life for Chinese citizens. Yes, there is a flourishing free market, including in animal products of dubious health benefits like bats, but there is also a rigorous repressive machinery that regards bad news as an insult to the system rather than a problem to be solved.Maoist totalitarian fantasy still rules the media space so far as the Communist leadership is concerned. Admitting problems is - if not wholesale treason - then certainly unpatriotic.Coronavirus | Opinion and analysisThis blockage of not only of dissent but of sensible suggestions from people outside the party elite is becoming the Achilles Heel of the Chinese Communist system. Instead of listening to Dr. Li, the Party forced him to recant his informed medical opinion just long enough to let the virus spread unhindered until it could no longer be denied.Now on Chinese social media the “rumour-mongering” of which the Party accused Dr Li, is going – and for once the term is appropriate – “viral”. Tens of millions have sent or re-sent messages calling for the state to issue Dr. Li with a posthumous apology.Worse, though, are the proliferating conspiracy theories about what caused the Coronavirus. Is it a biological weapon? If so, did it escape the lab by accident or was it genetically-engineered to target Chinese by the CIA, the Japanese or one of China’s many old enemies? Such rumours are dangerous but symptomatic of the deep scepticism about official narratives in China.Distrust of Big Brother in Beijing is widespread across the vast country - though outwardly of course, people kowtow to the official line. If you draw attention to yourself you can be crushed by the full weight of the Chinese state. But if you mouth the right slogans and can grease the right palms, you can do pretty much what you want.Behind the mask of totalitarian efficiency there is a level of internal scepticism few in the West are aware of people know what to say in public but think and gossip very differently in private. Corruption is a natural byproduct of this system, whose rigid rules may be evaded or bent by those with connections or cash. That has meant that food hygiene controls or health checks on people are subject to bribery and favouritism. The conspiracy theories abounding about the origins of Coronavirus are symptomatic of the regime’s malaise. Belatedly Beijing may be telling the truth about the likely source of the infection, but disbelief remains a serious threat to getting people to follow official instructions. What is “official” is often taken for granted to be untrue. What else have they been hiding,  members of the public will ask, if they’re now prepared to admit the need for countless millions to be quarantined.Even if the Coronavirus is brought under control it has dealt a severe blow to President Xi’s credibility and the stability of his repressive system. The illusion that prosperity without liberty was all people needed for a good life in China has cracked.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Some moral support, if you will some assurance that, yes, you can do this, you absolute hero.So, I was naturally delighted with the online response to my first 2020 pledge blog. In it, I’d outlined plans to become a more sustainable parent in a bid to do my bit for the environment.“Best way to help the planet,” noted one cheerful commenter almost immediately upon publication, “is to have no children.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“By producing another human being,” came another, “you are making the climate change emergency worse. We need to have forced surgical sterilisation to bring the population to manageable levels.”They weren’t alone, either.

Whatabout-ery, I think they call it.Sure, you might have sold your car but what about the fact you went on holiday abroad last year? Sure, you might eat only vegan but what about the fact you use a gas oven to cook? Sure, you might, while still a teenager, have single-handedly inspired your entire generation to rise up and put climate change on the global agenda — but what about the fact you allowed yourself to be interviewed by a BBC journalist who took a flight to conduct it?All fair questions perhaps but, then, I can do a bit of whatabout-ery myself.I’m promising to be a more sustainable parent to save the planetThat is to say: unless the people who ask these questions live in electric-less, hand-woven wigwams, eat only foraged plants and drink nowt but stream water, what about them slinging their hooks and letting the rest of us do our bit in the rational, everyday way we can? What about that, fellas?There is a serious point here. Such criticism — with its purer-than-thou platitudes and virtue-signalling standpoints — is the quickest way to achieve mass turn-off, when, in fact, dealing with the climate crisis is absolutely dependent on mass buy-in. Indeed, dependent on a million people like you and I making the small changes that will ultimately equate to huge differences.Which is why, despite being a monster who brought a resource-guzzling, air-polluting, land-filling person into the world, I’m still going to try and, you know, recycle a bit more, maybe use the car a bit less, eat a bit of veggie here and there.

We now do it a better way, I believe, for my family’s health, my children’s future and the local, national and global environment they will still be calling home long after I’m food for worms.\u0026nbspTaking matters into our own hands has been empowering to the point of intoxicating. It has helped curb a fair bit of eco-anxiety, we’ve lost a few pounds and, contrary to popular belief, it has already saved us a small fortune.\u0026nbspUpping the ante on our waste has also refocused our minds on other damaging aspects of our modern life, so we don’t fly anymore, our diet is increasingly plant-based and our car is electric. We’re trying to reduce the amount of water we use and take care of what we put down the drain, that kind of thing.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s normal, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be because it’s normal. We’ve got over the hurdles of our first zero waste Christmas, holiday, birthday party. This is how it is going to be, how we believe it needs to be for the rest of our lives.\u0026nbspOur families and friends, work colleagues and schoolmates have stopped assuming this is a phase, or just ignoring our wishes, and have started asking for support as they cut down waste themselves.\u0026nbspWhy eating with the seasons in January is harder than it soundsAnd yet at the back of my head I’ve got doubts. I can’t shake the idea that I’m kidding myself over what we’re really achieving with all this.\u0026nbspIt’s not that we’re too insignificant to make a difference. We get that thrown at us a lot, mostly from people who somehow think our lifestyle decisions are all about judging them and get defensive.I obviously don’t agree anyway. I have two tiny children and I refuse to believe that I can’t help protect their future. My usual response is “It’s only one plastic bag, said 7 billion people”. I think I stole it off Instagram or something.\u0026nbspNo, my nagging doubt is about what truths I might find if I dig a bit deeper.\u0026nbspTake something simple, like recycling. Most of the nation does it in some way. Ours is almost exclusively metal and glass, and there’s a lot less of it than there used to be.\u0026nbspBut I know the recycling process requires transport, energy to transform the material and more energy to reintroduce the renewed item back into the consuming system. Should we be “zero recycling” too?And, if you start thinking about it, what about the environmental impact of the restaurants we go? The places we stay away from home? How our friends make the food we eat when we visit? If I really want to see this through, should I be asking our local café what they have had to throw in the bin to make me that sandwich? If they have, should I stop using it? Should I stop supporting my local economy, adding to the risk that it closes and people who live in my little town have to start driving miles for a cuppa and a cake?\u0026nbspWhat about all the non-physical consuming I do? What’s the carbon impact of the email I’ll send my editor about this blog post?If I pursue zero waste to its limits, will I ultimately find that there are almost no services I can use? Will a truly zero waste life effectively mean dropping out of society? And if so, which compromise is one too far? Where do I draw the line between looking after the environment and looking after my family and myself? How much effort am I willing to make and at what cost?Because these last two are the questions I suspect we’re all asking about our environmental responsibilities right now, here’s my 2020 pledge. I’m going to up my game, I’m going to go for true zero waste to see what that really means.I’ll review the decisions that have got our family to where we are now, do the research on our real life impact and then take it to extremes to find out what is possible for your average household.\u0026nbspSo, as I say, I’m not sure this is a great idea.\u0026nbspBut I have to try.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The average ratings for the feeling that things done in life are “worthwhile” decreased by 0.5 per cent.The ONS said this was the first time it had recorded a fall in both life satisfaction and feeling that things done in life were worthwhile since it started measuring them in 2011. The measure was launched by former prime minister David Cameron to obtain other measures of happiness besides economic growth.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe ONS also said on Thursday that people\u0027s concerns about the general economic outlook continued to grow up to September 2019, reaching their highest level since late 2011.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Children from Oaklands Secondary School in Bethnal Green and Families Belong Together campaigners in Westminster before handing a petition in to the Home Office, as they call on the government to amend the UK\u0027s refugee family reunion lawsRasputin the polar bear, shakes off water as he is unveiled at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, DoncasterPolice activity inside a cordon where a man was shot by armed police in a terrorist-related incident in Streatham, LondonMicheal Ward with his Rising Star Award alongside Daniel Kaluuya BaftasActivists attend an anti-Conservative government, pro-Scottish independence, and anti-Brexit demonstration outside Holyrood, the seat of the Scottish Parliament in EdinburghPro EU supporters display a banner \u0027 Here to Stay, Here to Fight, Migrants In, Tories Out\u0027 from Westminster bridge in front of the Houses of Parliament in London.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016. On average, people spent less on cars in over the period than they did in 2016, with spending on recreation and culture, and utilities growing more slowly over the same time.“This is the first time that ratings of life satisfaction significantly fell,” ONS researchers said. “It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK.“After this period, average life satisfaction ratings reached a plateau, with fluctuations quarter on quarter but no significant changes up to their deterioration in the latest quarter.”Prioritise citizens’ wellbeing over GDP in budgets, Iceland PM urgesMeanwhile figures from the organisation for Economic Cooperation and development showed that the UK was the only member of the Group of 7 (G7) rich nations to suffer a fall in people’s average income.The OECD, known as the rich countries’ think tank, said real household income per capita contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2019, by minus 0.7 per cent, unwinding much of the 0.9 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months.Households income per person grew by 1.5 per cent during the two years to September 2019, just half the average of 3.0 per cent for the G7 as whole.A barometer of consumer confidence among British consumers also fell in October.

The average ratings for the feeling that things done in life are “worthwhile” decreased by 0.5 per cent.The ONS said this was the first time it had recorded a fall in both life satisfaction and feeling that things done in life were worthwhile since it started measuring them in 2011.

However, the January reading by GfK’s long-running Consumer Confidence Index increased two points to minus nine for January adding to evidence to an upturn in spirits decision the General Election.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We stand in full solidarity with staff who are taking strike action.”University staff will pay around £40,000 more into their pension – but they will receive nearly £200,000 less in retirement following reforms to the pension scheme, the UCU says.Increased contributions and other changes to the universities superannuation scheme\u0026nbspmean many people are suffering substantial losses, the union has previously warned.Jo Grady, general secretary of the UCU, said: “We are on the same side in this dispute and we hope students across the UK will put pressure on their vice-chancellors and principals to send the employers’ representatives back to the negotiating table with a clear mandate to work seriously with us to try and resolve them without the need for further action.”A Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said: “Universities understand that missed teaching time is unsettling and will try to ensure that students do not miss out by providing replacement teaching and learning resources.\u0026nbspIf students feel these are inadequate, they should take this up with their university in the first instance.\u0026nbsp“If they are not satisfied with the response they can complain to the relevant ombudsman for their country and they could be entitled to financial compensation if reasonable alternative arrangements were not put in place.”University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so. That is similarly intended to allow people to better understand their feed, and get rid of anyone they followed a long time ago but no longer wish to see posts from.Selena Gomez says Instagram is ‘destroying’ some of her generationAll of the features are intended to allow people to have more control of their news feed and hopefully better curate what they want to see.“Instagram is really about bringing you closer to the people and things you care about — but we know that over time, your interests and relationships can evolve and change,” a spokesperson said.“Whether you graduate, move to a new city, or become obsessed with a new interest and find a community, we want to make it easier to manage the accounts you follow on Instagram so that they best represent your current connections and interests.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were to be the last pieces of the lunar surface to come back to Earth, since humanity has not been back in the nearly 50 years since.That means that those remaining samples are especially precious since they are limited and can not be easily replaced. They can also be profoundly illuminating, offering us our only chance to get close to rock taken from a whole separate world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

You\u0027re almost guaranteed to find something new or unexpected.This technique has such high sensitivity and resolution, you find things you wouldn\u0027t find otherwise and only use up a small bit of the sample.The technique is called atom probe tomography, and involves incredibly precise manipulation of inidual grains. It has previously been used in industrial processes – but the new breakthrough has come in turning it for the first time to lunar samples.It works something like nanocarpentry, said Professor Heck: like a carpenter shapes wood, we do it at the nanoscale to minerals.The sample is placed inside a special probe and then shot with a laser that knocks off inidual atoms, which then fall onto a special plate. Researchers can examine those elements by timing how long they take to hit the detector – since heavier ones take longer – and so the type of atom can be worked out.It has already helped researchers see the weathering and materials that can be found inside the lunar soil. That in turn could help future astronauts as they move to live on the Moon, since they could survive by taking resources out of that dust.The researchers now hope they can get hold of samples from elsewhere on the Moon, and elsewhere in space, to allow them to better understand the makeup of the worlds that surround us. They compare our current understanding to analysing Earth using only one mountain range – to get a fuller grasp, they will need to examine a variety of terrains across the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc tv licence to rise to 157 50 a year","story":"Ministers confirmed today that the hike will come into effect later this year, for the fourth year in a row.Brits will receive a reminder or new payment plan reflecting the uprated fees when they come to renew their licence.Telly fans buying before April   will be able to get the reduced rate.The Government is responsible for setting the price - and its risen every year in line with inflation since .Before then it was frozen for six years at £. a year.But millions of pensioners who previously got a free TV licence will have to pay for it from June this year.The BBC is facing a huge backlash after their plans to scrap free licences for over s - affecting .million pensioners.Although, households with at least one person receiving pension credit - around , currently - will not have to pay.Boris Johnson has demanded the BBC think again and keep the pensioner perk.At present a TV licence costs £. for a colour TV and £ for a black and white one.The colour one will go up by £ and the black and white one will be hiked by a pound to £.Those who are blind or severely sight-impaired are eligible to a  per cent discount.Pensioners will have to pay for a licence from June , unless they qualy for pension credit.The news comes after the corporation announced  job cuts last week.Top presenters are at risk by the cost cutting measures as the firm desperately try to save £million.The corporation are currently facing huge competition from cheaper streaming services such as Netflix - where prices start at £. a month.Brits immediately took to social media to blast the firm for the decision to hike the fees yet again.One tweeted: Paying for your propaganda - the ultimate con.Another raged: Seriously, the BBC are putting the licence up after the appalling coverage and bias re Brexit and the general election.Cancel the licence, Boris...Earlier this week it was revealed that TV viewers who refuse to pay the fee could avoid court in future.The PM is said to want to shake up the broadcaster and the fee system it has relied on since the s.During the election he suggested he could get rid of them altogether.In -, . per cent of people dodged paying the licence and nearly , were prosecuted last year and five were jailed.Almost .million Brits cancelled their TV licence fee between  and  — a rate of almost one million a year.In recent years, this has been extended to include BBC programmes on iPlayer, whether they are live, catch up or on demand.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Punishing non-payers nowadays is absurd.The Beeb will fight all the way. But consider how it has trashed its once-proud reputation:Fundamentally it’s a dinosaur in the Netflix era and irrelevant to many, especially young people raised on YouTube.The Government must be bold. We need a much slimmer BBC to survive and focus on quality TV and radio.But the licence has had its day.BORIS Johnson can only lead the world on climate change with the public on his side and our economy in the front of his mind.The Government churns out random dates in the not-too-distant future by which it demands we all buy electric cars and replace our gas central heating.Yes, the UK is hosting a climate summit this year and it must be ambitious.But do the Tories have a clue about the cost to consumers and the economy  Michael Gove was suspiciously coy.This country is not governed by Greta Thunberg — nor the Marxist wreckers running Extinction Rebellion.The Tories must level with the public and ensure that our global warming efforts BOOST the economy instead of wrecking it.And they will be near-worthless anyway unless the world’s worst polluters, China in particular, follow the example Britain is already setting in slashing emissions.JIHADIST murderers and their supporters should be judged criminally insane and held indefinitely as long as they are a danger.Most villains recognise our civilisation’s definitions of right and wrong.IS do not. Their extreme version of Islam legitimises slaughtering innocent people.Anyone  randomly stabbing ­passers-by or encouraging it would probably be classed as insane and locked away forever.

Which is not surprising when they are at least £, more than the petrol equivalent and most have woeful mileage ranges.Yet the Government, desperate to advertise its green credentials, blithely announces a ban on new petrol, diesel and even hybrid cars in just  years.But it’s not a concrete, costed plan . . . just a giant leap in the dark.How does it intend to totally re-equip Britain for roadside charging — or fund it while its multi-billion pound fuel duty income withers away to nothing How will people afford these cars unless prices plummet, which experts say is unlikely in the foreseeable future  And why is the Government poised to axe the subsidies that help us to buy We don’t in principle think taxpayers should fund anyone’s new motor. But why remove buyers’ sole financial incentive now, when the industry badly needs a jump-start The Government is hopping on a bandwagon without considering the consequences, like Labour  years ago when it urged everyone to buy diesels.Meanwhile councils are already brainlessly instigating city centre bans or fines on all but the tiny number of zero-emission vehicles currently on the road.Who can blame motorists for being confused and angry  Many will happily drive more eco-friendly cars once they are viable and affordable.But this is all stick and no carrot.BRITAIN should not be proudly flying our flag for Prince Andrew’s birthday.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just a temperature check three days ago,” he said.“This is the same crew that prepare all the food and clean all the cabins so I’m finding it hard to trust the food we’re served.”He said one of the most unnerving things about the situation is how quiet the ship is.“I’ve been on ships a few times and it’s always busting with people. There are no sounds from outside my cabin, it’s eerie,” he said.Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said: As the people were staying together for a certain period in a closed environment, their contact was repeated.We will make it top priority to check the health of passengers and crew of the cruise ship and take thorough measures to prevent infections.Japanese authorities have tested  people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, tested positive for the virus.“The results of the remaining  tests came out and  tested positive,” Kato told reporters.“Today they will be sent to hospitals in several prefectures, and we are now preparing for that.“In total, out of  specimens,  tested positive,” Kato added.He confirmed the two-week quarantine period through February  will not be affected by the latest reported infections.The news comes after a third person - thought to be the first British national - tested positive for coronavirus in the UK.The patient was diagnosed after falling ill in Brighton and has been transferred to a specialist isolation unit at Guys Hospital in London.Just days earlier, two Chinese nationals were confirmed to have the deadly virus in York - sparking fears the deadly virus was spreading.UK officials are now ratcheting up health advice to cover travellers from seven more countries outside China - Singapore, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Macau and Hong Kong.Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer of the NHS, also confirmed that doctors will now begin testing anyone showing signs of the illness,they have recently travelled from Asia to the UK.Meanwhile, the Diamond Princess – a ship owned by British-American firm Carnival Corp — remains docked at Yokohama Port since February  in quarantine.The health checks began on Monday evening after an -year-old Hong Kong man who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for the killer bug - which originated from a food market in Wuhan, China.Currently, the global death toll stands at  with more than , people infected across  countries and territories.A majority of the cases — , — have been confirmed in China.Public Health England revealed, as of  February, a total of  UK tests have been carried out -  were confirmed negative and three positive.More than  Brits who were evacuated from Wuham are currently in quarantine in Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside.All UK hospitals have been told to prepare secure coronavirus zones to avoid a surge in emergency departments.But York Central MP Rachel Maskell has hit out at the lack of communication from health authorities about the coronavirus outbreak.She said of the latest suspected case: It is crucial that the public are kept informed of developments associated with the Coronavirus infection.I have raised this twice in the House of Commons this week and am awaiting a further meeting with the Minister.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their bosses make mind-boggling salaries.It’s payback time.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick’s imaginative plan will cut prices for local first-time buyers by a third —  a huge dference.But the Government must ensure hundreds of thousands of affordable homes get built this way.Previous over-hyped initiatives have produced derisory numbers.Long-term we need a bonfire of planning restrictions,  more developers able to compete and far more houses built.Campaigners warned the new homes must not come at the expense of losing new social housing.Polly Neate, boss of Shelter, said: “The country desperately needs more low-cost homes which are genuinely affordable to those people struggling at the sharp end of the housing crisis.“But, instead of offering a route to building additional low cost homes, this policy simply puts at risk the social homes currently being built.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future. If not, she’ll become a footnote to the history of British media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhen I appeared on Good Morning Britain with Iain Dale and Nihal Arthanayake this morning, the first item we were asked to discuss was the horric attack that took place at the Tate Gallery a few months ago. A six-year-old boy was thrown off the upper viewing deck of the gallery by -year-old Jonty Bravery, who was in care at the time. This week, a recording was released in which we can hear Jonty telling his carers that he wanted to kill somebody by pushing them off a tall building. The conversation reportedly took place over a year before the attack at the Tate. My immediate reaction to the story was to think back to all the harrowing accounts I had heard from local councillors about the parlous state of children’s social care. The care provided by local councils to some of the most vulnerable teenagers, children and babies in our society has been stripped to the bone by a decade of cuts to local government funding. Central government funding to local government has fallen by nearly % since  and most councils simply don’t have the cash to provide the services vulnerable children need. What’s more, by increasing poverty and unemployment and making it harder for vulnerable families to access services, austerity has increased demand for children’s social care services at the same time as budgets are being cut. Between  and , the number of children in care rose from , to ,. In , the cross-party Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee warned ministers that children’s services were ‘at breaking point’, stating that funding cuts were putting children at risk. The Children’s Commissioner for England concurred, saying councils have been ‘starved’ of funding as a result of the UK’s harsh austerity regime, and that children’s services were ‘at tipping point’.  Given that a series of reports have shown that an overstretched workforce and staff shortages are compromising children’s safety in the care system, it is not unreasonable to assume that funding shortages were one of the reasons Jonty Allen’s case wasn’t escalated sooner. When I made this point on GMB, Dale responded by claiming it was ‘utter rubbish’ and that the case has ‘nothing to do with cuts’. I was about to respond by pointing out that a series of experts – from the Children’s Commissioner, to the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, to the British Medical Association – have said that austerity is compromising the quality of children’s social care services but before I could finish, Dale tore off his microphone and stormed off the set.  The Twitter response was swt and predictable. I was a ‘gobby cow’ and ‘the hard left Katie Hopkins’ for talking about the impact of austerity on our most vulnerable children. Dale, on the other hand, was venerated as a hero by accounts such as ‘Traditional Britain’. Nihal Arthanayake – who was sitting on Dale’s left and weighed in to support my comments – was ‘a lefty Asian spouting socialist s***’. I’m used to receiving abuse online – it’s something that any woman with a  will have experienced at one time or another.

University law graduate Sarah Harvey was working as a PA for a luxury hotel group and lived in an apartment at the iconic ,ft high Marina Torch building in Dubai Marina. But she had been battling depression and anxiety and had been prescribed anti- depressants. An inquest heard that on August  , Miss Harvey, , whose mother is a parish councillor in the village of Rainow, near Macclesfield Cheshire, wrote five suicide notes before leaping from her the window of her flat. She fell  floors before landing on a balcony on floor . Miss Harvey suffered multiple injuries and died at the scene. Police who examined the notes found they expressed Miss Harveyaposs sorrow and of her desire to end it. The hearing in Warrington was told Miss Harvey who attended Fallibroome Academy school in Macclesfield had moved to Dubai after completing a law degree at university in . She had initially decided to travel the world and joined Emirates Airways as a flight attendant before pursuing a career as an assistant company secretary for a luxury hotel group.

There were visits to the UK and phone calls but they revealed nothing and she acted very well. “Sarah discussed with us that she was being prescribed anti depressants but she didn’t elaborate to the depth of her despair. Her friends had noticed a change in her normal going out appearance in the final weeks and they recommended that she sought help which she did do. “But she had made no attempts on her le of any serious nature other than in her first year of university when she suffered with self doubt in her ability. This was swtly corrected on her examination. “The notes that where found, there were five in total were addressed to dferent iniduals. In these notes Sarah expressed her sorrow about what she’s about to do but that she cannot live any longer with her anxiety and depression. And she was expressing a desire to end it.” Dr Fawzi Benomran, the head of the Dubai police general department of forensic science and criminology, said: “In response to a report from Dubai police I went to the Dubai Marina at pm on Tuesday August , . “Her friend reported that the deceased had suffered from depression and was taking medication for it. I sent a sample of blood to be analysed and it indicated a low concentration of anti depressants.

What was supposed to be a magical family time turned into despair for the parents of Ava Souter as they rushed their beautul shining star to hospital thinking she had the common infectious viral illness.But they were crushed when medics at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee quickly found the little girl had killer meningitis.And tragically, Ava developed septicaemia and has joined the angels this week after bravely fighting with all she had.Heartbroken aunt Melissa Wilson paid tribute to her beautul niece, the Daily Record reports.She wrote: How is this fair  Look at you, our dear Ava. So beautul, so sassy, so full of le! I canapost quite believe that youaposve been taken from us. The pain is too much! You will never be alone. We will never forget you and we will always love you! Until we meet again Ava, our beautul shining star. The youngster, from Perth, was fighting with all she had, a relative told the paper previously. A fundraising page had been set up to help ease the financial burden for the little girlaposs parents.  Writing on the GoFundMe page on January , Melissa said: It was confirmed that she had developed meningitis along with septicaemia and is still fighting what began with the flu. She is fighting this with all she has. Since entering the hospital we have seen slight progression with Ava which is really great but her mum and dad have been warned that it will take months for her to recover. Ava has recently been transferred to one of the hospitals in Edinburgh so that sheaposs is in the best possible place. Her parents of course want and need to be by her side throughout this so will keep them from work meaning it will keep them from earning enough to keep the household going.

Jamshed Javeed was jailed for six years in March  for planning to travel from his Manchester home to Syria to join IS. Despite being handed an extended sentence, the Parole Board cleared him for release last year when he was halfway through his sentence. He was initially thought to be eligible for release in March but officials confirmed he has already been freed from prison on licence. The news comes as the Government presses ahead with plans to bring in emergency laws to stop any more terrorists being freed from prison automatically by setting up a specialist Parole Board  to review cases eligible for release. Lawyers are gearing up to fight the proposals, set to be put before the House of Commons next week, arguing that the rules cannot be imposed retrospectively on criminals already sentenced. The urgent legislation was put in motion after two terror attacks in three months were carried out by convicted terrorists following their release from prison. Javeed was poised to travel to the war-torn state in late  but his family hid his passport in a desperate attempt to thwart his plans. Despite learning his we was pregnant, the teacher - who taught  to -year-olds in Bolton - persisted with his plan after helping his younger brother make the trip. But he was arrested hours before he was set to leave the UK.  Police discovered he had researched prominent figures such as the radical clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, as well as the jihadi group Jabhat al Nusra on the internet. Javeed insisted he was travelling to support the people of Syria and not join the terror group when he admitted two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. But Judge Michael Topolski QC, when sentencing the -year-old, said he was not satisfied that Javeed had rejected Isisaposs ultimate aims and ruled that he posed a danger to the public in the UK and abroad.  He was handed an extended sentence of nine years, six of those to be served behind bars with a three year licence period afterwards. At the time Judge Topolski said: Whether you believed you were fighting in a just cause is irrelevant. The law is clear - this was terrorism. He said Javeed remained adherent to a violent jihadist mindset, adding: You are in my judgment an inidual whose potential danger to the public in this country or abroad is clear. The Parole Board said his case was concluded in June last year.  He has since been released. Offenders are subject to strict licence conditions and can be recalled to prison at any pointthey breach them or their risk appears to have increased, the Ministry of Justicesaid. Conditions include GPS tags, internet bans, curfews, living in a bail hostel or restrictions on who they meet. Terrorists on licence are banned from contacting accomplices or others with terror convictions and are closely managed by probation, police and other authorities who share information on the risk they pose. A target of February  has been set to rush the Bill through Parliament as police chiefs warned that the threat of terrorism is not diminishing. It is understood Sunderland shopkeeper Mohammed Zahir Khan is due to be released on February , while around five other terrorists are expected to be let out in March unless the new law is in force. The father, originally from Birmingham, was jailed for four-and-a-half years in May  for posting messages and material that was supportive of IS on social media.

But before long they changed their minds and had another one. And then another. And then another. Now, the couple have  beautul children - including two sets of twins - and say they wouldnapost change it for the world. Entrepreneur Jacob, , who launched a business designing and selling household gadgets in , and stay-at-home mum, Cassanda, , have the art of parenting so well sussed that they even blog about it, offering advice to other mums and dads. Jacob, of Lehi, Utah, USA, a mechanical engineer, said: “By baby number two we thought weaposd had enough but turns out we hadn’t, and it was the best decision we ever made. At the end of the day, weaposre just normal parents who happen to have  kids. Yes, the fact we have  might make us slightly less normal, but we love each and every one of them just the same. However the couple do admit that theyaposve had some negative comments from judgemental people over the years. Jacob added: “We do get the odd comments like, aposYouaposve got your hands full,apos or, aposYou must be some sort of day care centre.apos “And some people say we’re irresponsible for having so many kids, but we just brush the comments off.” Parenting Steven, , Christopher, nine, identical twins William and Ryan, both seven, non-identical twins Spencer and Max, both five, Thomas, four, Henry, three, Lily, one, and Peter, six months, efficiently, but with plenty of love and affection, has made Cassanda confident she has the experience to give fellow mums and dads solid advice.  People just assume weaposve got a bunch of unruly kids who rule the roost, because thereaposs so many of them - but thataposs just not the case, said Cassanda, who launched her blog with Jacob in June . Being part of such a large family is actually good preparation for children, as they have to learn how to compromise and deal with dferent personalities. Itaposs actually made our children better behaved. The blog offers advice to other parents and also gives us a way to document all the memories we make. I try and keep it real, but I also put a positive spin on every day andone other mum can benefit from reading about how I stay on top of my laundry routine, then itaposs worthwhile. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints faith, which permits contraception but encourages big families, the couple even claim that having a big family can be easier than just having a couple of children.  Cassanda said: “I speak to people who have one or two kids and they’re like, ‘I have to entertain my kids and play with them all the time.’ I’m like, ‘Well, I don’t.’ “We’ve got so many children that they entertain and play with each other. Weaposre also really lucky because the older kids dote on the younger ones. Jacob and Cassanda – who met at Brigham Young University in Idaho in January , before embarking on whirlwind romance and tying the knot in August the same year – admit having such a big brood was not their initial plan. Cassanda was one of eight siblings and I was one of six,” Jacob said. We both loved being part of big families, but six children was always our limit. Then, after their first two, Steven and Christopher were born in August  and February  respectively, the couple thought their family was big enough.  Steven was a fine baby, but Christopher was enough to put anyone off becoming a parent, Jacob laughed. His cry was louder than any other child Iaposd ever heard - and he cried a lot. I just thought, aposThis is not for me - two is more than enough’. But, once teething was finished, Christopher came into his own and the couple changed their minds. Jacob said: When Christopher mellowed out, we were like, aposOh, this is fun, lets definitely have another one.apos But they were still taken by surprise when they fell pregnant with identical twins, William and Ryan, born in August . Iaposve got twin uncles and Jacob has cousins who are twins - but we never thought weaposd have them, Cassanda said. I have to admit, I did get to the point where I just thought, aposHow in the world will I ever cope with this apos and, aposHow can I go on apos.  I said to Jacob, aposI just canapost go on any more I need more help.apos But he turned to me and said, aposCassanda, Iaposve got nothing left.apos But, admitting how hard it was made us stronger. After that, we both just got on with it. We didnapost need to find a magic solution. Once they had everything under control, when the couple fell pregnant again, this time with non-identical twins, instead of despairing, Jacob remembers them feeling really chuffed. Speaking about the arrival of Spencer and Max in April , he said: The shock wasnapost nearly as profound as itaposd been with the first twins. We knew it would be fine. We had a stroller we could fit all the babies in, so we knew weaposd be okay. But the couple were so sure they were done once they had six children that Cassanda gave their old baby clothes and her old maternity clothes away, only to swtly retrieve them when Thomas, now four, was born in November .  Iaposm not sure why exactly we tried for another, but lots of people would ask us, aposSo are you guys done now apos I think that put the idea of having another baby in our heads,” said Cassanda. Weaposd start asking ourselves, aposAre we really done ’ After a while it just felt like someone was missing. Thomas was the best baby there ever was. He made us happier and made the other kids happier. He was such a lovely little baby, plus he slept through the night. Encouraged by Thomas’ good behaviour, the couple decided another baby was on the cards, so, Henry, three, came along in . And in , Cassanda and Jacob welcomed their first baby girl, Lily. We were both ecstatic to be having a girl. As soon as we found out we went straight to the shops to buy a little girl outfit,” Jacob said. I was so happy I couldnapost stop laughing and Cassanda was so happy she couldnapost stop crying.” And in July last year, the couple finally decided that their family was complete, when baby Peter arrived. By then we were  per cent sure we didnapost want any more kids, Cassanda said. Before, weaposd been unsure and we decided thatGod wanted us to have more, then we would - but now itaposs like, aposPlease, no, no, noapos.  Being part of a family of  has certainly honed the coupleaposs diplomatic skills. When youaposve got  kids, itaposs impossible to get everything done, Jacob said. We live by the mantra, aposWhen you canapost do what youaposve always done, do what matters most.apos This is the kind of common sense they advise people to follow in their blog. “I write lots of tips about how to stay on top of chores and how to run a household with so many children,” Cassanda said. When it comes to mealtimes, I like to be organised and I make a monthly meal plan, so everyone knows what theyaposre getting in advance. Our kids arenapost fussy, and they donapost have any allergies either, so dinner times arenapost so bad - we keep it simple and cook lots of soups, or pizza, enchiladas and salads. And the self-professed thrty shoppers only spend  per weekto feed all  of them. Weaposre savvy shoppers and save coupons or buy things on discount, Cassanda said. Sometimes, people think we’re having some sort of party and always ask aposWhy do you need so many bananas apos Also, the seven oldest children are expected to help with the household chores. They have to do one chore every day, Cassanda explained. They each get given a room they have to tidy. It shouldnapost take them longer than  minutes, because it’s just picking toys up or wiping down the sides - itaposs not a deep clean. Some of the kids are done within  minutes, but others can take half an hour, because they spend most of the time crying about how hard it is!  But it is not all work and the couple are careful to write about the fun their family has in their blog, too. During most summers over the last  years, Iaposve either been pregnant or nursing a newborn, Cassanda said. So, to be safe, we usually do staycations, where we stay at home, but we set aside some time for fun activities. We go to museums, to parks or on day trips to dferent places - but at the end of the day, we all come home to our own beds. Last year, we went camping in Yellowstone National Park and that was great fun. Because our children are so little, all of us managed to fit in an eight-man tent.

Storm Ciara is expected to cause damage to buildings as well as disrupt transport with cancellations to air, ferry and train services expected.

But do those murderers also share the same star sign  David Jester, the British author, spent two years researching the zodiac signs of some of the most prolic or notorious serial killers on both sides of the pond to find out. Jester, whose new thriller The Clinic hits the shelves this week, found that more killers on his list were Taureans - born between April  and May  - than any other star sign.  He also discovered that April  and February  stand out as two of the days on which the most killers were born. We’ll leave it to you to decidethere really is a connection orbirthdays and star signs are just a co-incidence. Butyou have a Taurean friend acting a little suspiciously…keep an eye on them. Serial killers, broken down by birthdays, are: Aquarius Aquarians don’t like broken promises. It can anger them when someone promises one thing and delivers another. They have a severe distaste for people who are boring and they are always looking for excitement. Might this explain those killers who lash out and kill for fun  Aquarian serial killers include:Gary Ridgway : One of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, with a kill count that is said to be the country’s highest. Also known as the Green River Killer. Lee Boyd MalvoDavid BirnieJoel RkinJohn Bodkin AdamsLuis Alfredo Garavito : Known as “The Beast”, Garavito is one of the most prolic serial killers in history, admitting to the rare, torture and murder of nearly  boys and suspected of killing over .Pisces Pisceans don’t like being alone and hate being criticised. They are compassionate and artistic, but the same has been said for many serial killers. So, which serial killers have the Pisces zodiac sign  Let’s take a look:Aileen Wuornos : An angry woman who had many issues in her past. She killed several men, seemingly without remorse. John Wayne Gacy : A killer who dressed as a clown. He certainly seemed to be artistic, but compassionate he was not. Dennis Radar : A family man who got away with his crimes for many years. He was caught because of his desire to be infamous and to toy with police. Also known as BTK, or “Bind. Torture. Kill.” Stephen PortRobert NapperColin IrelandPeter Manuel : A Scottish serial killer. Doug Clark Aries They are determined and confident, but they can also be short-temper and impulsive. They are leaders who enjoy challenges and may see themselves as the strongest, best and most capable, traits that can be very useful and can lead to success in all walks of le, but ones that can also have a dark side. Arians on this list include:Alexander Pichushkin : A Russian serial killer who is said to have killed as many as  people. John Reginald Christie : An infamous serial killer who was active during the s and s. Herbert MullinHenri Desire LandruJudy Buenoana TaurusAlthough reliable, Taureans can also be stubborn and possessive. They don’t like anything too complicated, they despise insecurities and they don’t do well with changes. They are devoted, patient and hard-working, traits which can make for a great personality in someone who is stable and good-natured, and an evil manipulator in someone who is not.H. H. Holmes : Said to be America’s first modern serial killer, Holmes created a murder castle and was almost ingenious in his unspeakable evil. An intelligent, devious man who chased money more than anything . Michael Ryan : The man behind The Hungerford Massacre. He armed himself with assault rles and launched an attack on his sleepy, suburban community, before killing himself. David Copeland : Known as the London Nail Bomber, Copeland was your average Neo-Nazi scum who made it his mission to kill and maim anyone who wasn’t as white and as crazy as he was.

Orville Lynn Majors : Robert Black : A Scottish serial killer and paedophile. Steve Wright : An English serial killer who raped and murdered several women. Martha Beck Gemini The Gemini is thought to be nervous and gentle, traits you wouldn’t expect to see in a serial killer. Far from being loners, they tend not to like being alone. They also hate being confined and don’t work well with routine, always seeking something dferent. Their adaptability can help them to fit into any new environment and social circle, which means they can hide any dark side better than most.David Berkowitz : Also known as the Son of Sam. A loner who shot multiple people, apparently because he worshipped Satan, but mainly because he had a few screws loose. Jeffrey Dahmer : The stereotypical serial killer. He was a loner, he abused animals as a child, and he performed unspeakable acts on living and dead victims. Peter Sutclfe : Better known as The Yorkshire Ripper. He killed prostitutes in s England because of what was described as a “severe distaste for women”. Richard ChaseTed Kaczynski : Also known as the Unabomber, an American terrorist. Trevor Hardy Cancer Cancerians do not like it when someone criticizes them or the ones they love. They can also be very moody and tenacious. This makes them more prone to lashing out. If you believe in astrology then you might expect this to be one of the main zodiac signs for serial killers. However, we could find very few that serial killers with Cancer as a zodiac sign, none of which were particularly infamous or well known.Robert Maudsley : Responsible for the death of  people, three of which he killed while he was in prison for the first murder.Leo We often see serial killers as arrogant, struggling to grasp reality. They don’t like being treated like they are not the most important person in the room. Well, these are also traits that you will find associated with Leo. So, does that mean this is a zodiac sign that many serial killers have Myra Hindley : One of the most infamous female serial killers in the history of the UK. Raymond MorrisJohn George HaighAnatoly Onoprienko : Active in Ukraine and known as Citizen O. One of the world’s worst serial killers based on the number of victims he claimed.Virgo Many serial killers begin by torturing animals, but one of the traits of Virgo is a love of animals. However, they are also known to be rude and they dislike asking for help, believing that they can go it alone. There is a certain perfectionism associated with them as well, which is something that we often see portrayed in serial killers on the silver screen and in books. But what about real le  Is this one of the main zodiac signs of serial killers Ed Gein : A loner who the Psycho film was based on. He kept skin from his victims and used it to adorn his home and create a suit of skin.

DeSalvo escaped prison the first time and after being caught and taken to a maximum-security prison, he was murdered by another inmate.Libra Often considered gentle and caring, with a severe distaste for violence, the Libra does not look like someone who would kill, let alone kill multiple times. So,there was any connection between zodiac signs and serial killers then this would be a good astrological sign to research.Fred West : A man who murdered alongside his we and was known to torture and kill young girls, including his own children. One of the worst serial killers, ever. Beverley Allitt Scorpio Seen as truthful but stubborn, Scorpios can also get very jealous. They are brave, but they can be violent, resourceful and secretive, which are traits you wouldn’t be surprised to find in serial killers.Moses Sithole : A deranged serial killer, he was definitely violent and secretive. Robert PicktonFritz Haarman Sagittarius Sagittarians like to be free. They love to travel, see the world.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday. Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gary-and-Piacquiao-940x531.jpg ","title":"boxing fanatic gary todd describes brushes with the biggest stars in the sport since move from st marys to sydney","story":"Interviewing Muhammad Ali, having lunch with Manny Pacquiao and tracking down Deontay Wilder # it#s all in a day#s work for Dundee-born Gary Todd.Growing up in St Mary#s, Gary never would have imagined that one day he#d get the chance to meet boxing legends such as Mike Tyson and Julio César Chávez, however after moving to Sydney in  his le changed completely.The former Rockwell High School pupil now has two international bestselling books on the sport of boxing, and has had the chance to travel to countries such as Japan, Canada, the Bahamas, Hong Kong and the USA.He said: #I grew up in St Mary#s andI#m honest I didn#t go to school a lot.#I went to MacAlpine Primary School and I was at Rockwell for a year, but I dropped out to start working and earning some money.#I got a job at the slaughterhouse, but after a while I felt like I couldn#t see a future for myself in Dundee, so I decided to do a bit of travelling.#I went to Australia on a visa and loved it so much I decided to stay.#My we Jenny came with me and we got married and started a family here.#The boxing fanatic decided to join a local gym near his new home in Sydney, and soon found himself interviewing some of boxing#s greatest legends for a book on all the dferent workouts used in the sport.He said: #I#ve always been passionate about the sport, so I joined the gym.#I started training there and I made some connections and pals, then I kind of slipped into writing my book.#Throughout the course of writing his workout book, Gary has travelled across the globe, getting interviews and pictures with over  boxing champions.However, it hasn#t all been a walk in the park for the father of three.He said: #One time, a bodyguard threatened to shoot me.#I was talking to Marvin Hagler, who#s actually my favourite boxer of all time.#His bodyguard was annoying me and getting in the way and we started arguing.#He threatened to take me outside and shoot me, and Marvin Hagler just had to stand between us.#Gary, whose day job is as a director at a construction company in Australia, has gained a large amount of fame and respect in the boxing community for his work.He has produced two books, Workouts from Boxing#s Greatest Champs Volume  and , which have been popular among fans of the sport.The -year-old has been invited to watch Deontay Wilder#s fight against Tyson Fury later this month in Nevada, and plans to continue his work interviewing the biggest names in the sport.He said: #I#m a family man, I#m a construction worker, and I#ve got a passion in le which is boxing.#I#ve been into it since I was  years old, when the first Rocky film came out in cinemas.#It took me around  years to finish my first book, and I went all over the world.#I saved up my money and frequent flyer miles, flying all over the world economy class.#In two weeks, I#m planning to fly to Las Vegas to watch the Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder fight as part a member on a press accreditation.#He also confessed that his thick Dundonian accent does present a bit of a challenge at times, saying: #I do get some comments on it.

That happens in football.“I want to play and I’ve played the majority of my career in Scotland so when the opportunity came up to join a massive club, there was only one thing on my mind and that was to come up here and get it sorted.“I came up to Dundee last Friday and was in the stadium the majority of the day getting things sorted.“I knew a few of the boys from before but Saturday was the first day I actually met the team so it’ll be good to have a full week together before this weekend’s game.“It is hard to come into a team like that, you just have to adapt quickly.“It can actually be a good thingyou don’t know many people because you have to make an effort to get to know them and their game.”And Elliott has been impressed with the quality in the Dens Park squad, evenhe felt they should have done better in his debut at Cappielow last Saturday.“There are big players in this team. It comes down to the better team on the day, though.“We can have a lot of big iniduals butwe gel as a team we’ll get going.

I haven’t played for a while so I’d love to play  minutes tomorrow.”Field’s move north was a late one, only being confirmed less than an hour before the transfer deadline last Friday.But he says he jumped at the chance when he heard Dundee were interested.“It was about three, four o’clock when I heard about it,” he added.“I had to rush back to the training ground, sort everything there and I didn’t have to think about it – I was going to Dundee as soon as I heard.“There were other clubs but Dundee were the right one for me.“I didn’t have any worries coming up here.“There were a few Scottish lads in the Brentford B team who I’ve talked to – Ali Coote, who is from here, Jonny Mitchell, Theo Archibald.“Ali had left for Waterford before this move came around but we’ve messaged each other and he said ‘definitely go’.“I don’t know much about Scottish football, to be honest, but I do know that out of all the teams in the Championship, Dundee try to play.“That’s a big reason why I came here.”As well as a recommendation from former United man Coote to move to the city Field will have another reminder of home tomorrow.Reece Cole, on loan at Partick Thistle from Brentford, is a good friend and Field hasn’t been slow in ramping up the banter ahead of tomorrow’s game.“I know Reece really well,” Field said.“I joined Brentford a week after he did so we are really good mates. I’ve told him I’m going to leave one on him! That’s a joke, obviously.Alex Jones is there, too, and I know him from Bradford so there’s already been a lot of banter.”The young full-back is also familiar with Dens Park.“I’ve been here before, I watched a game.“Lee Carsley was our U s manager and we came for a pre-season tour, playing a few teams and we watched a game against Everton here at Dens Park.“That was five years ago so I don’t remember much but I do remember the atmosphere being good. It was pre-season but there was still a great atmosphere.” vw, px\"  Field’s deal with the Dark Blues is only until the summer but the left-back is happy just to be given a chance to get football.“That suits me,” he added.

The site was then occupied by Jamie’s Italian, which opened in February , before closing down in .Dustin Macdonald, chairman of the Aberdeen City Centre Community Council, said: “It’s disappointing to see so many units lying empty on Union Street but it becoming increasingly dficult for business owners who are up against online shopping.“There are a lot of empty units, particularly on the upper floors of Union Street, and it would be great to see that space being used.“But it is a widespread problem because businesses are up against online shopping nowadays. I do think there is an onus on business owners to try to make their building more appealing to customers.“There are grants available for business ownersthey wish to have the front of their stores done up, and I would encourage them to do so.”Under the city centre masterplan, a blueprint approved by the local authority in June , a number of objectives were set out to regenerate the city over the years to come, while conserving its heritage.Phase one of its planned projects are currently underway, which includes the rejuvenation of Aberdeen Art Gallery, which opened in November, and the pedestrianisation of Broad Street, which was finished at the start of August .Other schemes include installing suspended street signs in areas across the city centre and banning traffic on Langstane Place, Justice Mill Lane and Windmill Brae from pm to am.Phase two of the scheme is planned for years four to seven of the project and includes ersying employment space as well as developing skills and training in the services sector.The Queen Street initiative, which forms part of phase two, also hopes to deliver more than  new homes and incorporate a civic hub.In , a Union Street Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme , was launched. The five-year initiative aims to “restore the majesty” of Aberdeen’s main street, and is a £. million grant fund which is available to owners of eligible buildings to undertake high quality repairs, restoration and the refurbishment of buildings.Since its inception, it has been used to refurbish a former jewellers into a hot dog restaurant.Real Hot Dogs at  Union Street opened in August  after making use of the grant to clean up the shop front, however it closed in January last year.The scheme is currently planned to run until .Adrian Watson, chief executive of business body Aberdeen Inspired, said: “Union Street as a high street is changing and this is necessary, in a challenge that is not felt in Aberdeen alone, but across the country.“We need to think dferently about the experience we offer and of course there are still challenges here as we make this transition. Our efforts to continue revitalising Union Street are ongoing and enhancing the experience for those living and working in the city is an integral part of what we do as an organisation as we aim to drive footfall in the city centre.”Aberdeen City Council is taking an active approach to improve the city centre and has served notices on businesses deemed to “negatively impact the amenity of the area.”The owner of one business, Inspirations on Union Street which is vacant, was asked to make a string of repairs due to its condition bringing “signicant disamenity” to the area.An appeal was lodged with the Scottish Government last year which was rejected this month.Councillor Marie Boulton, the council’s lead on the city centre masterplan, said: “Union Street remains very much the heart of Aberdeen. The council is working with Historic Environment Scotland to conserve the fabric of its most important buildings by offering grants to owners.“CARS also aims to stimulate the economy by encouraging occupancy of vacant commercial units and upper floors for residential use. The council is continuing to invest in our heritage as well as events that showcase our unique streetscape.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/6f579393-451a-4fb6-b3f8-be92922fd5b2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/6f579393-451a-4fb6-b3f8-be92922fd5b2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/6f579393-451a-4fb6-b3f8-be92922fd5b2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/6f579393-451a-4fb6-b3f8-be92922fd5b2-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"winds of up 60mph set to batter north east","story":"Winds of almost mph are set to batter the north-east this weekend.The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for wind on Saturday and Sunday for the whole of the UK, with disruptions to travel to be expected.Winds of up to mph will batter north-east towns such as Peterhead, with gusts of around mph expected in other parts of the country. vw, px\"  Delays to road, rail air and ferry transport are being warned throughout the country with coastal communities and sea fronts to be affected by large waves.Some bridges and roads could be shut and potential damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs has been warned.There is also a chance of power cuts."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/SNS-18393182-Aberdeen-v-St-Mirren-2-815x564.jpg ","title":"derek mcinnes open to bringing tommie hoban back to aberdeen if he proves his fitness","story":"Derek McInnes has refused to rule out signing Tommie Hobanthe ex-Watford defender s to full fitness.Defender Hoban is a free agent having been released by the Premier League Hornets last summer.Hoban suffered cruciate ligament damage last February that required surgery while on loan at Aberdeen.After a year out, Hoban is close to completing his recovery and has accepted a long-standing invitation from McInnes to train with Aberdeen at Cormack Park.The -year-old is set to join up with the Reds next week.Hoban made eight starts for the Dons last season before suffering the knee injuryMcInnes said: “That invitation to Tommie has always been there but there was no point in taking him up until he was ready to get his boots on.”Hoban recently posted on social media that he was “grateful to finally be feeling strong again” and that he was “hungrier than ever to get back out there”.Hoban suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament in the - draw with St Mirren at Pittodrie on February .It was the second serious knee injury to hit Hoban inside two years as he was ruled out for the whole of the - season having suffered a cruciate ligament injury with Watford.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone.

aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing. Leasing companies, such as Intelligent Car Leasing, are specialists in electric car leasing.Although you never own the car, you can lease the vehicle over ,  or even  months for regular and affordable monthly payments.At the end of each lease, you simply renew for a brand new, more technologically advanced vehicle. The process is very simple. No haggling with pushy car sales people over price no issues with selling it later on.There are certain conditions you have to be aware of - such as the carrsquos appearance and the number of miles travelled.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

The bomb, for which the Continuity IRA have been blamed, was discovered on a lorry on Tuesday at a commercial premises in Lurgan.Police said a warning call was made to a media outlet last Friday, stating a device had been left in a trailer in Belfast docks and it would explode on a midnight ferry.The trailer, however, had never left Lurgan and there was no midnight ferry scheduled to sail.A fruitless search was carried out on a ferry that left Belfast at around .pm, but a further, more detailed call was made to the same media outlet on Monday.This call led to the discovery of a device under a lorry trailer at a business park in Lurgan on Tuesday.It was claimed the intention was for the device to explode on Friday evening around the time the United Kingdom left the EU.On Friday, police released two images of the device, which Detective Superintendent Sean Wright said could have caused serious injury or worse.“These images clearly show the explosive device attached to the lorry.

A device exploded as security services were dealing with a hoax device placed by the side of the road. No one was injured.Figures show there was also a drop in the number of people arrested and charged for terror offences last year.There were  persons arrested under Section  of the Terrorism Act  in the last year, compared to  during the previous year.The number of persons subsequently charged also dropped from  to  over the same period.Belfast Related ContentVideoNorthern IrelandContinuity IRA blamed for Brexit day ferry bomb plot The PSNI have said they believe a bomb bound for a ferry to Scotland was planted by the Continuity IRA.Northern IrelandJustice Minister Naomi Long condemns dissident republican Lurgan bomb findJustice Minister Naomi Long has condemned the discovery of an explosive device in a Co Armagh industrial estate.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland be .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcf-dbf-d-dc-afdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland be .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcf-dbf-d-dc-afdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland be .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcf-dbf-d-dc-afdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland be .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcf-dbf-d-dc-afdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland be .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcf-dbf-d-dc-afdd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandRise in shootings, bombings and paramilitary-style attacks, NI figures showThere has been an increase in the number of shootings, bombing incidents and paramilitary-style attacks in Northern Ireland over the past year, newly published police statistics have revealed.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsNorthern Ireland braced for wild weekend of wind and rain with snow next week as Met Office ups weather warnings,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She explained that the pace of change in such a short period of time can be traced to a number of factors including the de-industrialisation of the city and the legacy of the Troubles.Since the Good Friday Agreement and in the last  to  years there has been huge changes in the city, but obviously the urban environment particularly, she explained.The city centre has become a shared space. The best comparison for the development of Belfast would maybe best be to somewhere like Sheffield and Bristol.Ours was more pronounced though because it was people fleeing the city and living where. The urban environment of Belfast changed because of the Troubles.The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter changed what was previously a very local area into a vibrant part of the city.What can happen with those larger scale developments is that they have great potential to act as a catalyst in the community.While bright new buildings and hotels have popped up, Professor Mulholland does strike a cautionary note about the importance of adequate connection and ensuring Belfast meets future challenges, particularly around climate change. Going forward, she believes we should have an eye on how to ensure the city is sustainable.It depends on careful city planning to make sure the infrastructure is there, she added. There has to be a focus on building a connected city. One that is accessible, particularly by walking and cycling routes.One thing which could be really exciting for Belfast is Stormont declaring a climate emergency, which creates a focus on what is good for this city.I am a big believer that Belfast could be one of the most beautul cities in the world. It is a really beautul size in terms of everything being in walking distance. It has that potential to harness.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsCoronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsNorthern Ireland braced for wild weekend of wind and rain with snow next week as Met Office ups weather warningsBelfast schoolboy in serious condition in hospital after being struck by car,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The issue of Paul Quinn’s murder and the degree to which Sinn Fein sullied his name for so long and his mother was so courageous in coming forward.“It illustrates the problem with Sinn Fein. They have not cleansed themselves of their bloody past and they want to create a new narrative that the war was just for the last  years but so many people lost their lives. People are repulsed by that and the fact that it took the mother of Paul Quinn  years to get an apology. vw,vw,px, px\"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, third right, during the last day of General Election campaigning “The other issue is the incompatibility of Sinn Fein’s economic policies with ours as they are proposing an extra  billion euro in taxation that would choke enterprise here in Ireland. We’re a small open economy and that kind of taxation would destroy the self employed and small to medium sized businesses.”Meanwhile, canvassing in Dublin, Sinn Fein president Mary-Lou McDonald pledged to use whatever mandate her party receives wisely.“The people were ahead of the curve in real terms in articulating the kind of profound change that they want, people were telling us ‘we want change and by the way you are it, so get ready and serve us well’,” she said.Can confirm: Mary Lou McDonald not scared of dogs. #GE pic NWFprSSZLI— aoe-grace moore.February , “I’m looking forward to the finishing line and I’m hopeful people come out and vote in great numbers, but it won’t end for us until the polls close, so we’ll be out and about talking to people, and I suspect the song that our activists insist on playing around me ‘Hello Mary Lou’ will get a blast, so I’ve my parents to thank for that,” she said.“It’s very important people realise your vote matters, because people have been left behind by the old politics.“Every vote is equal tomorrow, the vote of the wealthiest person, the vote of the person who is really struggling by, you have an equal say, please realise that and please come out and vote for change.“But before any vote is cast, just to say that whatever mandate we get, we will use wisely and we won’t leave people behind.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsMan found dead in Belfast city centre public toiletsNorthern Ireland braced for wild weekend of wind and rain with snow next week as Met Office ups weather warnings,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The target is that no patient waits more than nine weeks, but  of those iniduals have been waiting in excess of nine weeks, with the longest wait forty-one weeks. In addition, , people are waiting to access psychological therapies. No patient is supposed to wait longer than thirteen weeks, however,  have done so - the longest wait recorded  weeks. It was recently announced that the Stormont executive is to set up a new working group on mental wellbeing and resilience. googletag.cmd.push It is the first time that the executive has collectively demonstrated determination and unity to tackle mental health issues including suicide. Health minister Robin Swann said the issue requires a strategic, coordinated and sustained approach across government departments. Interventions A Spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trustsaid: “Respecting confidentiality the Western Trust does not comment on the inidual treatment and care of its patients. “Those presenting in crisis to an Emergency Department will be seen within two hours by a mental health professional and will have a thorough mental state assessment. This service operates seven days per week across the Trust. “In addition the Trust also operates the Card Before You Leave scheme . This scheme offers next day appointments with a mental health professional for those presenting with a mental health crisis who have been assessed as being low risk of self-harm.” She continued: “Following assessment patients may be offered a range of interventions including admission,appropriate, to a psychiatric bed, referred for follow-up by an appropriate community mental health team, referred to an appropriate community or voluntary organization or discharged back to the care of their General Practitioner. “There are a range of statutory and voluntary services which respond to those with mental health issues in the Western Trust area. “Services in the voluntary sector can be accessed through self-referral or through referral from mental health services, acute services or Emergency Departments. Statutory services are accessed via GP and or Emergency Department referral.”  Crisis intervention service No decision has yet been made on the future of Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Service based at the Holywell Trust building on Bishop Street. In its first year the de-escalation service helped over  people in ying degrees of crisis, including those at risk of suicide or self-harm. Service Co-ordinator, Joe Thompson, wholeheartedly believes it has been le saving in that time. However, funding is not in place to ensure the long-term future of the service. Yesterday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that the University of Ulster has carried out an evaluation of the pilot Community Crisis Intervention Servicewhich will help inform statutory health partners on future service provision within the council area. The Health and Social Care Board are also considering a request from Council for funding to allow the pilot CCIS to continue to the end of March . Mark H. Durkan MLA tabled a question to the Department of Health regarding its commitment to the continuation of the Community Crisis Intervention Service in Derry. In response this week, a DoH official said: “The Crisis Intervention Service in Derry is led by Derry and Strabane District Council. “The Health and Social Care Board are currently considering a request for funding from the council to allow the project to continue until the end of March . An evaluation report is awaited to inform future service provision.” If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story and need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After the game, Brian Rainey hailed his sides spirit and although they battled back against the odds. For the most part, it was a terric contest between two well matched teams but Claudy will always look back on this game with regret. They will ponder how the game wouldve panned out had the score not been changed during their spell of dominance. googletag.cmd.push When you have team of young lads fighting for every inch of the game, they look up at the scoreboard and they have been docked two points, it is hard for those young cubs to take, Rainey commented after the game. Still, they battled on and still they gave everything. Unfortunately, that decision, which wasnt explained - I dont know how it happened or how it came about - I am just very frustrated that something like that can affect the game in such a way. Claudy carried the underdogs tag but a ninth minute goal from Niall McGonagle gave them the perfect confidence boost. Oisin Kearns-Madden won a kick-out and it was Tiarnan OConnors high ball that found McGonagle on the edge of the square before he slotted home. Matthew Marron, who finished with -, notched two early Blayney points but it was Claudy who held the upper hand and were full value for their - to - lead after  minutes. A mark, called by referee McCarron, saw Niall Rice reply for the Monaghan men who swtly scored again after McGonagle spilled a kick-out and Joseph McMahon passed to Rice for another score. An energised Castleblayney side were level though Marron before centre-back Liam Martin put them into the lead for the first time after  minutes. However, it was Claudy who finished the half strongly. McGonagle, who played at midfield for the second quarter, floated a perfect ball to OConnor who cleverly snaked inside the Blayney cover before firing to the roof of the net, helping his side go in at the break - to - ahead. Like he did at the start of the first-half, OConnor won the breaking ball from the throw-in but Claudys move broke down. It was Blayney who hit the first two scores of the second-half, from Rice and Marron. A touch of McGonagle magic from an acute angle saw him squeeze over a point before the Monaghan men hit the net. Dylan McKenna made the catch at midfield and at the end of the move, Rice raced clear. Despite the clutches of Ben Cooke, he blasted to the net, giving goalkeeper McCormick no chance. In the next play, Claudy almost found the net and couldve had a penalty. Adam Murphy passed to Niall Barr who squared the ball for the in-rushing Keelin Hasson who was impeded by goalkeeper McCully in the goalmouth. Play continued before Claudy were awarded a free in and Hasson was replaced with a head injury. McGonagles free tied the game once again. The Dungiven man then slotted over the bar, with a hint of goal on, and Claudy were back in the lead. Or so they thought. After the score was changed, Claudy were shell-shocked and Castleblayney took full advantage. Marron slotted home a penalty, with defenders Nathan and Zachary McArdle chipping in with points. McGonagle had a close range free blocked by a wall of Blayney players and OConnor saw a late shot blocked by keeper McCully as the brave Claudy fightback came up short.

The Christmasaurus by Tom Fletcher was a quirky read about a Christmas dinosaur and we both chuckled at the last line from lead character William Trundle. Itll not be long until well be penning the next Santa letter and on the journey home from Newry on Saturday night, I began to think how I would word mine. Dear Santa, can you bring me a long term plan that will provide high fetching midfielders to Derry. I have talked about it many times but now I am writing to you looking for something I think we really need and would get long term joy from. Signed, Sideline View. googletag.cmd.push I have said it over and over. There is no substitute for big mobile men in the games engine room. The systematic method of securing primary possession from short and strategic kick-outs is a brilliant development. I think back to watching Rory Beggan for Scotstown against Slaughtneil in Clones. Sitting behind Stephen Cluxton in Croke Park one day. The movement that goes into it must take hours. Its a craft. Closer to home, Thomas Mallons kicking against Leitrim in the league final last year. It too was an exhibition. People had said how quiet Michael McEvoy was that day, but the upper Hogan Stand view was a dferent one. The Magherafelt mans rehearsed runs were as selfless as they were vital. googletag.cmd.push The same could be said of Odhraacuten Lynchs ability to pick out Danny Tallon, Ciaran McFaul and Padraig Cassidy on Saturday night. Its a skill we should never throw away. The runs of Conor Feeney for Daryl McDermotts kick-outs the same. But what happens when the spaces on the flanks begin to disappear. In the closing stages, when diesel tanks in the outfield runners begin to empty and the dashboard lights start to flash, plan B needs to kick in. In Derrys case the worrying sign is that out and out midfielders are gone. Last year in the qualier clash with Laois, Derry couldnt buy a ball at midfield in the crucial final quarter and bowed out of a game they had within their grasp. The same can be said for the Leitrim game last week. Outside of Emmett Bradley pulling wide, there was no option of a leaping midfielder to pull off something magical. Niall Hollys four catches at midfield against Magherafelt in last years championship were just a memory. Conor McAtamney put in an exhibition of fielding at Glenullin a few years back. Holly is injured and Macca hasnt featured in the league. Sean Dornans catch on Saturday night got the loudest roar of the night in Paacuteirc Esler. “Good man Pat,” roared Down stats man Kevin McGuigan into his ear-piece in the press box when Pat Havern earlier plucked one from the clouds. Rory Burns got most of his kicks away cheaply early in the first half as Derry pulled the line back to midfield. As the half wore on and the Down keeper began to kick with more venom, the Oakleafers hoovered up enough breaking ball to leave them in control. Late on, despite seven wides, Derry looked like they would pull through. Then when Conor Poland scythed down Padraig Cassidy in full flight and got sent to the sin-bin, Rory Burns had only one option. And that was to enter the Neil Collins, Damien McCusker drive er as far as you can mode from the clashes of the s. Along with John OLeary, they were the best in the business. Derry didnt have anyone tograb hold of a game that was ebbing away without them really knowing it. I always remember Mickey C Conlan speaking of his get out clause. If he lost a pre-defined number of kick-outs in a row, Enda Muldoon was the next target. “Big Enda will always get it,” he told me. Slaughtneils Antoacutein McMullan was always able to play the Patsy Bradley card. In the Ulster final win over Kilcoo the Emmets retained  kick-outs out of . All strategic. One year on, against Cavan Gaels press, Patsy – almost licking his lips - was back in the ball game, plucking bullets from the sky as the route one was called again for. Callum Mullan-Young got lambasted in certain quarters after last years county final but when the game was in the mixer. He was left to crash and burn as Glen didnt have an out ball when Magherafelt closed the door on their plan A. In a few weeks when I pen my letter looking for midfielders, it is a long-term project, not a one-dimensional one. More like, bringing back the forgotten skill. Lets face it, we need it. Last week, one player with the desired leap, Conor Glass, was in Tasmania for Hawthorns pre-season training. With us haemorrhaging his like to the AFL, we need to build a wider base. We need toto square one and make sure we tick box number one. Adrian McGuckins recipe for MacRory Cup success, apart from the tough training and his before his time sport psychology, was simple two facing three. Across the pitch, the ball started at the side with three. The ball was delivered from wing to wing. Every two minutes the directive changed. Balls to the chest, one bounce ballsthe pitch was in decent shape and high balls. It covered all eventualities. “Get your arms up like the number ,”hed bellow, in reference to the need for outstretched arms. “Time your run, get your leading knee up and catch the ball at the highest point,”hed insist. Then it would y. Two facing two with a man in the middle for a minute of hell. Fielding high ball after high ball. Simple but unbelievably brilliant. How many coaches are doing it any more  Most people will wrongly say it is outdated but when the game is all about possession, you can never hone this skill enough. First touch is everything. What Derry wouldnt have done for an Enda Muldoon, a Patsy Bradley or a Fergal Doherty in the last ten minutes on Saturday night. Rory Burns would have to scratch his head a bit more and Odhraacuten Lynch wouldve been able to exploit his full repertoire. William Trundles Christmas list will most likely include a reunion with the Christmasaurus. Mine is a long term plan that will provide Derry with a better selection of big, lean, mobile players to play both cards. Peel to the wings for a short and fly through the air to collect a high one above the cluster...in a manner that inspires. Never run away from the basics. ALSO - Players should not have to choose.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

We are blessed in team Sinn Feacutein to have depth in leadership, from Vice President Michelle ONeill and our new chief whip, John ODowd.Since Stormont was reinstated, lots of things are learning curves for myself, but the mix of enthusiastic newbies and more experienced older heads in our group means that help with issues is never far away.Over the next two years, I am determined to see delivery for this area coming out of Stormont, and membership of these committees, Communities and The Executive Office in particular, will aid with this.

It was good to be with family to watch it, they were all very excited and the atmosphere was good.”The south Derry man, who works as a janitor at St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast, said he was delighted to link up with Tom Jones but that he was relieved any judges had turned their chairs.“It’s a long six seconds that you have to wait before starting. You’re thinking ‘please, just anybody’ but I was over the moon when both Tom and Olly turned.“Going into it, I thoughtI could have anyone to turn it would have been Tom, ideally. I just respect him massively for what he’s done in his career and I thought he’d have great advice.”Tom Jones was thrilled to add Jonny to his team and tweeted on Saturday night: “Every team needs a voice like @BrooksFresh! Authentic, soulful and raw! That was very special. I am over the moon Jonny is joining #TeamTom.”By opting for the Welsh star, Jonny has put himself in competition with Brooke, who linked up with Meghan Trainor, but in a previous era, the two performers’ grandads were on the same side.Jonny’s grandad Roddy Gribbin was manager of the Derry senior football team that reached the  All-Ireland Final, while Brooke’s grandad, Patsy McLarnon, was corner back on the team.The pair also starred for Newbridge club side Sean O’Leary’s in  when the team took home the Derry senior championship cup.Jonny and Brooke have clearly inherited that competitive edge from their grandfathers, and both siners are no strangers to on-field success either. Brooke collected a Derry intermediate camogie championship title in , while Jonny starred in the Newbridge side who won the Derry U B Football Championship in . googletag.cmd.push Jonny was full of praise for his fellow Oakleaf contender: “Brooke has that big, bright, bubbly personality and everyone gets on well with her. When I heard her accent I said ‘you have to be from somewhere nearby’, and when she said she was from Bellaghy I couldn’t believe it.“You get a lot of time to sit and chat and because Brooke and I had that bond of where we were from we connected almost immediately.”Each coach needs to recruit  acts to bring through to the second stage of the competition – the battle rounds – but that number will be halved before they move to the next stage.Both Tom and Meghan will be hoping to channel the competitive streak of both performers’ grandads as they move forward in the competition, but the two Co Derry natives could yet end up on the same team.Judges have an opportunity to steal one act from another coach before the competition reaches the live shows and fans will be hoping the two County Derry stars remain on their screens for a few weeks longer. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Today, Derry Credit Union – whose motto is “For people, not for profit” - has a staff of , over , members with shares totalling almost pound million. Last year,  new members joined Derry Credit Union, bringing its membership to , adults and , minors. At the end of the last financial year, members’ sharestotalled pound,,. As at September , the loan book was valued at pound,,. This is an increase of pound, in the year and brought the total of loans issue since the Credit Unions inception to pound million. googletag.cmd.push At its annual general meeting in November last, the credit committee reported that in the period from October , , to September , last year, , loanswere issued to the value of pound,,.. This was an increase of pound, compared to the previous year and brought the loan book to pound,,. The Abbey Street financial institution has a number of events lined up to mark its th anniversary.  Civic reception One of the first was held on Tuesday night last when management, committee members, staff and members attended a civic reception held by Derry City and Strabane District Council. googletag.cmd.push At the event in the Guildhall, hosted by Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, tributes were paid to the “Derry Six” - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume – for their “forward-thinking” decision to set up the non-profit-making organisation which, since its inception, has loaned out pound million to its members. Cllr Hunter said it was a “delight” to host the civic reception for the Credit Union. She added: “The Credit Union has enabled so many families and people to be on their feet over the past  years. It has been the backbone of the development of Derry. “Through the loyalty and dedication of its members, Derry Credit Union has flourished to become the success that it is today. I hope its success will continue long into the future.” Speaking to the Derry News, Joan Gallagher, Derry Credit Union general manager, said she was “absolutely delighted” at the honour bestowed by the Council. She added: “Derry Credit Union has been a very important institution for Derry and it is appropriate the council mark it with a civic reception. “This kicks off the start of the celebrations for the th anniversary.” Mrs Gallagher described the founders of Northern Irelands first and Irelands third credit union as “absolutely amazing.” She added: “I only recently realised how young they all were – Paddy Joe Doherty passed away recently at the age of , so  years ago he was only  when they started out on the road to developing the Credit Union. “I think Paddy Joe was one of the younger ones and having had a look at the ages of the others, there was none of them over  and I think Paddy Bogside was the oldest.” Looking to the future, Mrs Gallagher said Derry Credit Union would “still be here” in another  years and Brexit would have very little impact on it. She said: “Those guysgave us a gt and for those of us who are still involved, it is our responsibility to protect that and we leave it in a suitable position to hand on. I do believe Derry Credit Union will be here in another  years – for it is part of the city. “Brexit will have very little impact on us – the members have their shares, have their savings – we will still be able to provie the services we have. “We have invested a lot over the past number of years modernising the Credit Union. “At Derry Credit Union, you can come in to the office and do all you business or you can do all your business online.”Mrs Gallagher revealed membership at the Abbey Street office stretched far beyond the citys boundaries. She said: “Our members are not just in Derry – we have members in America, Australia and a number of other countries – we are a sort of worldwide organisation now. We have an e-banking  on which you can apply for your loan at night, we look at your loan application in the morning, we will send you an SMS text to sign and we will have your money in your account that day.”  Not a bank Mrs Gallagher stressed Derry Credit Union was “not a bank.” She said: “We will never be a bank. What distinguishes us is that we have  operating principles which we very closely adhere to. We are a not-for-profit organisation – the banks are for profit and they look at every opportunity to maximise afor themselves. “We charge an interest rate which is very reasonable and we have a rebate on that – once we cover our costs, we give back what we have left to our members.” Mrs Gallagher said Derry had become a very dferent place thanks to the Credit Union. She said: “Since our inception we have loaned out pound million –you take that out of Dderry, what would it be ” Colm McCauley, treasurer, said it was a “great honour and privilege” to be honoured with a civic reception, the first of a number of events planned to mark the landmark anniversary. He added: “There will be a number of events throughout the year and this is one of the first – it is great it is happening. “Hopefully, the Credit Union will grow. We dont keep our heads buried in the sand, we are always thinking strategically at how we can consolidate – we cannot just standstill and we do have a strategic plan to carry that on.” Mr McCauley pointed to the financial situations many people found themselves in at the time the Derry Credit Union was formed as to why so many in the city – over a third of its population – were members of the local institution. He said: “You need to go back a bit when credit facilicities for a large section of the population in Derry were virtually non-existent. The Credit Union was born out of that and it has grown ever since – it is not a profit-making organisation and any surplus goes back to the members.” Sean Hegarty, president, also paid tribute to the six founding members. He said: “It is virtually unheard of that a credit union established  years ago has achieved the volume of growth that Derry Credit Union has – it is very appropriate and we are delighted to be invited along to this civic reception. “Those peoplewere very young by todays standards and they took the brave step forward and had the vision for the benefit of the community. “It is a very emotional time. There have been a lot of people involved from the absolute origins, right through the decades to this very day. “We currently have a board of directors who volunteer and give up their time freely and willingly. “The world has changed greatly and the Credit Union has had to move to stay up with those changes.” Mr Hegarty said there would be a “lot of families” who would find it much dferent without the Credit Union. He added: “They would find it very dficult when it comes to key things in their lives, from simple things from birthdays to Christmas, to the education of their children, needing a bit of work done to their house, needing a new car. “I am not talking necessarily needing a big help but when they do need a bit of help, there is an organisation there for them.” Helen Kivlehan was one of the Credit Unions members in attendance. She said she has a member almost since its inception and revealed what her first loan was for. She said: “My father enrolled us as children and I went on to become an adult member. My first loan was for my wedding. My husband now and I were both members and we both saved in the Credit Union towards our wedding because in our day our parents couldnt really afford it. “We saved up and borrowed the money against our savings and then paid it off.” Mrs Kivlehan said Derry “wouldnt be the place it is now without the Credit Union.” She added: “It is a lesaver for people like my mother and father, who was a docker. “The Credit Union has been very good to me. I have been able to provide education for my children and my grandchildren are all now in the Credit Union and it should be something that is passed on.” Orla ODoherty, a member of the youth committee, encouraged young people to get involved in the Credit Union. She said: “It is a good experience and helps build confidence and to learn new skills.”  How it all began The Credit Union Movement was introduced in Ireland in  by Nora Herlihy with the support of a number of other dedicated pioneers. The experience of most people in Derry in the s and early s was that of high unemployment. Banks and other financial institutions did not advance credit without substantial collateral or guarantees - you had to be a homeowner in order to get a loan and very few people owned their own homes in the late s. Money lenders charged exorbitant rates of interest perpetuating the cycle of hardship. Consequently, the ordinary working class people in the city had only very costly sources of credit available to them. Derry Credit Union was founded by six iniduals whose commitment to their community is beyond refute. Six locals - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume - believed the credit union could be a source of fair and reasonable credit for the ordinary man and woman. They met in a house in the Bogside on October ,  to combine their total savings of eight pounds ten shillings to establish the first credit union in Northern Ireland - and only third on the island of Ireland – a move that changed the fortunes and futures of generations in Derry people for the better.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

The ballot was ided into three sections, UK, Devolved and Local.In South Down, .% of over , young respondents said that protecting the environment was the most important UK issue, with almost % in favour of lowering the voting age to .Other key issues were tackling hate crime , welcoming refugeesand making UN Convention Rights of the Child law .Under devolved issues, .% of young people said mental health was the most important issue when compared to child poverty , ending kne crime , curriculum for leand stopping street harassment .Over , young people responded to this part of the ballot and % of responses were environmental issues mdash ranging from dealing with erosion at Ballyhornan to improving school eco-councils to introducing more recycling points.Overall, the top five biggest inidual local issues were stopping the amalgamation of St Patrickrsquos Grammar with St Maryrsquos and De La Salle High Schools in Downpatrick . Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment . These were followed by building a bridge between Strangford and Portaferry .The results were detailed in a report written by Cormac, who said he was ldquodelighted to have been able to recognise the dedication of young volunteers across South Down in helping their peers have their voices heard.He added: ldquoOrganising Make Your Mark for the past two years has been a challenge each time but one which I enjoy greatly and am privileged to be faced with.

He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10940577.jpg","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
