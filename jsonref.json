I was searching on Christian Mingle and s**t and I seen her profile pop up and I’m like, “This b***h is fire.”‘So I slid in her Christian Mingle messages and s**t and she responded to my email so then we had linked up and s**t… I don’t wear a condom!Blac Chyna ‘loses deal with stroller company’ as she \u0027uses one as weapon\u0027 in scuffleWe mean, these quotes are really something, but anything could happen in this Kardashian-offshoot universe. contacted reps for comment."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9813133.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"elizabeth olsen isnt happy boobs show avengers costume","story":"Elizabeth has just one want for her costume (picture: Marvel, Backgrid)Elizabeth Olsen has opened up about her thoughts on her Avengers costume, as the latest offering Infinity War smashes the box office.And, sorry to say, like Shania Twain, it didn’t impress her much.You see, the actress – who plays the powerful Scarlett Witch in the newly-released MCU epic – felt a little miffed she was the only woman whose costume showed off her cleavage, throughout the various sagas.‘It would just not be a cleavage corset. I like corsets, but I’d like it to be higher,’ the 29-year-old said, when asked by Elle about what she’d change on her costume. ‘Everyone has these things that cover them – Tessa Thompson does, Scarlett does. I would like to cover up a bit.The character shows a touch of cleavage for some pretty epic scenes (picture: Marvel)‘It’s funny because sometimes I look around and I’m just like, “Wow, I’m the only one who has cleavage”. And that’s a constant joke because they haven’t really evolved my superhero costume that much.’We have to say, her costume is perhaps a little more conservative in Infinity War, as opposed to Age of Ultron, when she was rocking a full on, busty corset.Still, she praised the MCU for sticking to their ‘iconic’ vision for the cast’s costumes, that continued to draw inspiration from the OG comics that championed powerful women.‘But then you look at where it started in the comic books and it was a leotard and a headband so…oh, it’s horrible, it’s so horrible,’ she added. ‘So at least they know that’s not cool. But then they made Wonder Woman, you know? And that’s what she’s in.‘I think of the costumes and what we have to wear—it’s more about iconic images, because that’s what these movies are…. I think that’s the goal with the costumes, and it’s not representing the average woman.’The actress – and sister of the Olsen Twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley – revealed recently she’d like to ‘explore’ the back story of her character.Talking to Digital Spy, Elizabeth revealed her hopes for Scarlet’s relationship with The Vision to be explored in more depth and said she would like the comic book back story to be brought into the movie.How much did Avengers Infinity War cost to make?Where was Valkyrie in Avengers: Infinity War?

Her resignation letter said she ‘inadvertently misled’ parliament.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt will also take on Ms Rudd’s former responsibilities as Minister for Women and Equalities, Downing Street announced.It follows intense pressure for Ms Rudd to step down over the Windrush generation crisis, which saw people who came to the UK as citizens detained in immigration centres, denied healthcare and threatened with deportation.The Hastings and Rye MP became the fifth minister to leave the Cabinet since last year’s snap general election.Her resignation letter said she took ‘full responsibility’ for not being aware of the existence of targets.Mrs May said she was ‘very sorry’ to see her successor as home secretary leave the post, while Ms Rudd’s opposite number Diane Abbott said she had ‘done the right thing’.James Brokenshire becomes the new Communities and Local Government Secretary (Picture: PA)The pressure had been building on the former banker ever since the emergence of the ‘appalling’ treatment of Caribbean immigrants to the UK between the 1940s and 1970s – the so-called Windrush generation.Concerns had been raised about the immigration status of the Windrush generation and there had been stories of people being forced to prove their annual presence in the country for decades in order to prove they were here legally.Ms Rudd referred to the Windrush ‘scandal’ in her two-page resignation letter, admitting that people with a right to live in the UK had not always been treated ‘fairly and and humanely’.Opposition parties said she was paying the price for Mrs May’s ‘hostile environment’ policy towards illegal immigrants when she was Home Secretary which had led to people being wrongly stripped of their rights and threatened with deportation.Sajid Javid, left, with Amber Rudd, centre right (Picture: Getty)Diane Abbott said: ‘This was inevitable, the only surprise is that it took so long.‘The architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give a full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch.’Ms Rudd had appeared to be prepared to ride out the storm announcing her intention to come to the Commons on Monday to answer MPs’ ‘legitimate questions’ about the removals targets.She had previously apologised in the House for the ‘appalling’ treatment of the Windrush veterans, announcing a taskforce to resolve their immigration status as quickly as possible.However, she was criticised for saying the Home Office was ‘too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual’, prompting accusations that she was trying to put the blame on civil servants.Her resignation follow those of former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, Priti Patel as international development secretary, Damian Green as first minister and James Brokenshire, who left his role as Northern Ireland secretary on health grounds since June last year.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents Home Office workers, said: ‘The Windrush scandal has highlighted how inhumane immigration policies coupled with cuts to Home Office staff and increased workloads is a recipe for disaster.‘The resignation of Amber Rudd should be a wake-up call to the Government to end the hostile environment they have created for people wanting to come to this country and to put a stop to the blame culture where Home Office staff carry the can for the failings of ministers.’MORE: Diane Abbott gets so much racist abuse her aides update police every weekMORE: Flood alerts issued as month’s worth of rain due to be dumped on Britain today"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9816187.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"tories keep standing like","story":"Sajid Javid outside the Home Office today (Picture: Reuters)What impression do you get when you look at this photo?Is it an overwhelming sense of competence, authority and strength?Presumably that’s what Sajid Javid was going for when he struck this power pose outside the Home Office on his first day in the new job, staring into the middle distance to contemplate the full historic weight of his appointment.But some people noticed something else.He’s not the only Tory politician to stand like this.

It’s very vibrant, very energetic, very different. He was probably covered in paint by the end. Is it a piece of performance art? I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow. Maybe Andy was getting some aggression out, maybe he wanted to burn off some energy. I think he was just having a bit of fun.

It cannot simply be a take-it-or-leave-it choice as the Prime Minister has suggested.\u0027This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. It would remove the possibility of a No vote leading to a \u0027no deal\u0027. It would bring back control to Parliament.\u0027  The visit comes a week after Brexit Secretary David Davis (pictured today in Downing Street) made a similar visit"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/10/002554A700000258-0-image-a-20_1525080320922.jpg","title":"Boxer Henry Cooper towers Reggie Ronnie Kray previously unseen picture auction","story":"    In a previously-unseen picture, boxer Henry Cooper (centre) towers over Kray twins Reggie and Ronnie in a snapshot that is now up for grabs at auctionThe photo was taken at Thomas A Becket pub and gym, where boxing legends Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and Sugar Ray Leonard used for sparring when they came to Britain.But the venue was home to Cooper, who once knocked down Ali with a single punch, as he trained at the gym six days a week for 14 years from 1956.In some of the photos, which were put up for sale on Monday with Stacey’s in Essex, are some of the Kray twins\u0027 associates, including Freddie Foreman.Foreman was sentenced to ten years in prison for reportedly being involved in disposing the body of Jack \u0027The Hat\u0027 McVitie who had been murdered by Reggie Kray.   The Kray brothers, who were born in Hoxton, east London, in 1933, began their life of violence young.

He was also publicly bisexual, an unusual thing to admit at the time, and something his brother found hard to come to terms with.Reggie was imprisoned two years later, but by 1960 both were out of prison and had become almost celebrities, socialising with stars such as Barbara Windsor, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, as well as well as eminent politicians including Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie had an affair.          In 1965, Reggie married Frances Shea, but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967, apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that Ronnie murdered herIn 1965, Reggie married Frances Shea, but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967, apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that Ronnie murdered her.The police frequently investigated the twins\u0027 activities, but with the East End living in fear of the notorious twins, no-one dared testify against them, so their misdemeanours often went unchallenged.          In 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack \u0027The Hat\u0027 Mcvitie, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knifeThe Firm then largely consisted of the brothers, their cousin, Albert Donoghue, and at least 13 others, including brothers Tony and Chris Lambrianou.In 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, also known as The Mad Axeman, escape from Dartmoor Prison, and put him up at a friend\u0027s flat in East Ham. He subsequently disappeared, and while the brothers were acquitted of his murder, a later book claimed that he had been shot.The same year, Ronnie shot George Cornell dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel. Cornell, an associate of South London gang, the Richardsons, is said to have remarked: \u0027Well look who\u0027s here\u0027 just before he was shot.And in 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack \u0027The Hat\u0027 Mcvitie in Stoke Newington, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knife, twisting the knife as McVitie lay dying.The brothers were finally brought to justice in the middle of 1968, when they and several members of The Firm were arrested, and both brothers given life sentences with no chance of parole for 30 years.The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: \u0027In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\u0027They were allowed out of prison for their mother\u0027s funeral in 1982, but Ronnie died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/09/4BA2A5A200000578-0-image-m-22_1525075469709.jpg","title":"Baby boy smallest survive born 24 weeks weighing just 13 ounces","story":"     Frankie Thompson, from Farnborough in Hampshire, was born at 24 weeks and a day weighing just 13 ounces - less than a tin of baked bins.

We are present in this country at the request of the government of Syria,\u0027 said Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, spokesman for parliamentary national security and foreign policy commission. The Syrian government has focused its efforts in 2018 on securing the capital Damascus, the heart of which was spared the worst of the seven-year-old conflict but was long surrounded by rebel-held pockets.Backed by massive Russian military support, the regime took full control of the Eastern Ghouta enclave earlier this month.The sprawling semi-rural area east of Damascus had been home to thousands of armed Islamist and jihadist fighters, who were besieged for years but sporadically fired rockets and mortar rounds on the capital.Pro-regime forces are now battling jihadists from the Islamic State group and other armed groups in southern neighbourhoods of Damascus.After days of air strikes and heavy fighting, state media reported late Sunday that those areas would be evacuated under deals similar to those that emptied other enclaves around Damascus in recent weeks.Buses started arriving Monday near Yarmuk, a neighbourhood once home to a Palestinian refugee camp and the main hub of IS forces in southern Damascus, state media reported.The transfer deal does not include IS fighters, but other jihadists from a former Al-Qaeda affiliate who control pockets inside Yarmuk, Abdel Rahman said. Netanyahu Says Israel Has Proof Iran Cheated on Nuclear Deal - The AtlanticNuclear Iran: The Birth of an Atomic State: David Patrikarakos: 9781780761251: Amazon.com: Books"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/12/4B8A680F00000578-0-image-m-17_1524657479817.jpg","title":"Woolwich homeowner 29 says jealous friends rent","story":"Why homeowner, 29, who managed to buy her own flat is still jealous of her pals who rent"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/17/4BB587A800000578-5674835-image-a-49_1525104074634.jpg","title":"Man asks internet sick day shown no mercy living room","story":"    The mirror took the most online abuse when the Reddit user asked for adviceA man who was pulling a sickie from work was savaged by angry Reddit users after asking how to spend his day off.The man posted an image of him from what appears to be his sofa, under a blanket and infront of the TV.He captioned it: \u0027Sick day today.

The kids can’t play outside in nice weather, because that’s when it’s worst. We can’t have people over for barbecues because it’s embarrassing. Who wants to sit outside in those conditions?’A very good question and one that he has been putting to Linden Homes, the estate’s developer, for the past 18 months.Mr Buller claims that when he bought the property he was never informed about what lurked beneath his lawn nor shown any drainage or sewage plans.The property was still a ‘building site’ when he first viewed it, and he says he felt under pressure to rush the purchase.‘We made an offer of £700,000 and it was accepted, but we were told we had to complete within two-and-a-half weeks if we wanted the deal at that price. The day I moved in, they were only just laying the grass as I pulled up.’It was not until a month later that Mr Buller spotted manhole covers on his front lawn.Linden Homes disputes his version of events and the two sides are now at loggerheads. Mr Buller has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estate and threatening legal action against Linden Homes.While his behaviour may seem extreme, Linden is not the only builder to come in for criticism. Pressure to fulfil government targets for building new homes has resulted in floods of complaints from customers. Problems include bouncing floors, leaks, missing insulation, poor drainage and unfinished gardens — as well as some cases of appalling customer service.Homeowner is mocked after putting his property on Rightmove¿...Divorcing naked gardeners are forced to drop price of their...Share this articleThis time last year one company, Bovis, was singled out for particular criticism. After it was forced to apologise, it set aside £10 million to pay for repairs and promised to cut back from building 6,000 homes a year to 3,500.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), the industry’s representative body, admitted that pressure to build new homes quickly had resulted in short-term problems. But it claims a corner has been turned and customer satisfaction is on the rise.Others are far from convinced. Across social media, groups charting the complaints of buyers against major construction firms run to thousands of members.They continue to highlight poor build quality and say that trying to get problems sorted is a constant battle, accusing builders of using delaying tactics and legal threats to keep them quiet.The situation has prompted urgent calls for a dedicated ombudsman to be set up to give more protection to buyers.‘We are very concerned,’ says Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the HomeOwners Alliance. ‘Problems with new-builds are one of our top issues — and things aren’t getting better.‘People think that, like buying a car or a toaster, everything is going to be perfect but the reality can be quite different. The Government knows there’s a significant housing shortage and is imploring developers to build quickly. Quality, it seems, has taken a back seat.’Housebuilding has certainly spiked. Output last year, stimulated by the Government’s Help To Buy initiative, was up 74 per cent compared with four years ago. A Government target of 300,000 new-build properties a year is now within the housebuilders’ sights.  Mr Buller spotted 11 manhole covers on the front lawn. He has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estateBut with this rush to build has come an increase in complaints.While the industry points to the fact that the latest survey of new buyers shows that 86 per cent ‘would recommend their builder to a friend’, others highlight the significant minority who would not. Again, the industry insists it is inevitable there will be faults, but that these get quickly sorted.‘When building something as complex as a new house, using multiple tradespeople, in all weathers, it’s inevitable there are some, usually minor, flaws, such as paint drips or an uneven door,’ says a spokesman for the HBF.‘Builders typically encourage new buyers to produce a list of snags in order to ensure homeowners are fully satisfied with the property once they have had a chance to experience it more thoroughly.’Virtually all new homes are sold with a ten-year warranty. Most of these are covered by the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK.If faults emerge in the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing them. If there is a dispute, the warranty company adjudicates between the two parties.As Bovis has discovered, failure to deal with these complaints can quickly tarnish a reputation.It was the only national builder awarded two stars out of five in the HBF annual customer satisfaction survey for the year ending September 2017. A two-star rating means that between 30 and 40 per cent of customers would not recommend the builder to a friend. Since then it claims to have turned things around.‘We have made huge changes to our build quality and customer service and have transformed Bovis Homes,’ a spokesman says.But, over on the Facebook page of the Bovis Homes ‘victims’ group, a different picture emerges.Dave Howard, the administrator for the 2,500-strong group, says new people join every week. Many tell him they have given up complaining because of the number of times they have been fobbed off.‘Dealing with Bovis customer service is like hitting your head against a brick wall,’ he says.One dissatisfied customer is 48-year-old Phil Hutchinson, a lecturer in philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University.At the end of November 2016, he and his partner purchased a £229,000 three-bed townhouse on a development in Sandbach, Cheshire. After moving in, a long list of faults quickly emerged.These included problems with the shower’s drain hot and cold taps wrongly connected a faulty washing machine an oven without a seal that caused the adjoining kitchen units to become scorched and faulty French doors.‘One of the first things we noticed was the stairs,’ he says. ‘We had nails coming through the carpet so we were all bleeding from our feet as we walked up and down.’Complaints to Bovis led to a steady stream of workmen coming to the house. They were all sub-contractors.‘They told us how it worked. People who fit the stairs, that’s all they do. People who do the plastering, that’s all they do.‘So the only person who has responsibility from beginning to end is the site manager.’As more problems emerged, Mr Hutchinson engaged the services of a ‘snagging’ company. It identified more than 180 items that needed rectifying.Ever since, he has been battling with Bovis to get them fixed. As with the original work, the repairs are contracted out. Workmen often leave without achieving anything.He explains: ‘Three damaged internal doors were identified. A year on, only one door has been replaced and that was last week. Every time they come, either the doors earmarked for our house have disappeared, or the doors are more damaged than those they are replacing, or the doors aren’t the right specification. That has happened on seven occasions.’There are also ‘discussions’ about fixing the bouncing floors. These flex, says Mr Hutchinson, because Bovis used joists spaced at 600mm rather than 400mm.‘You walk across the front room and the TV will rock backwards and forwards. In the bedroom, toiletries rattle on the bedside table.’ Most recently, workmen visited the house to replace a damaged kitchen worksurface. When they removed it they discovered a huge hole in the plasterwork in the wall behind from which the upstairs plumbing and pipework emerged.          Thomas, Rhian, Mark, and Holly Buller outside their home, which has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the family and the developers, Linden HomesNot only is it ‘shoddy workmanship’ but Mr Hutchinson is concerned that it could be a fire risk, funnelling any fire upstairs.‘It’s been appalling,’ he says. ‘I can’t believe in the UK, where we have all these checks and balances, that you have no protection when it comes to the most expensive purchase of your life.’A spokesman for Bovis says it is committed to improving its business and is focusing on its subcontractors — ‘working only with the very best and boosting our engagement with them’.He adds: ‘We apologise to any customer who, like Mr Hutchinson, did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are committed to putting things right.‘In those rare instances where things might be disputed, we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues. We are committed to meeting our obligations in these instances.’One of those forced to involve the NHBC is 43-year-old Victoria Sheader from Stone, Staffordshire. She and her partner purchased a new four-bedroom home from Taylor Wimpey last December.They were particularly taken by the fact that it had a sunny south-facing garden.According to the plans they were shown, a drainage system had been installed beneath it.‘Within weeks we noticed that wherever you trod in the back garden, it filled up with water,’ says Miss Sheader, who works in the financial industry.After digging exploratory holes in the garden, she claims they found a problem with the drainage.But attempts to get Taylor Wimpey to fix the problem — including more than 60 emails and phone calls — have failed. In the end, it was agreed that the NHBC should investigate.After a site visit last week, it concluded that it was up to the builder to carry out drainage works to prevent waterlogging.Miss Sheader is still waiting for a response from Taylor Wimpey.‘It is a beautiful house in a really nice area, but you can hardly ever go outside — it is so disheartening,’ she says. ‘I expected that buying a new-build house would be exciting. Instead, I wish I’d never bought it. It has been a nightmare.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We deliver thousands of high-quality homes across the UK, but there are occasions where we do not meet the high standards that we set ourselves. We apologise for the issues that Ms Sheader has experienced and we are fully committed to resolving these.‘Drainage issues with the garden will be fixed as soon as the scope of works have been agreed with the NHBC and Miss Sheader.’Other examples of continuing problems with quality and customer service are not difficult to find. Three days before Christmas, Bryan Don paid £340,000 to Morris Homes for a new-build home in Garston, Liverpool.But on the day he moved in with his partner and their son he says he found 154 faults.Issues identified by the 42-year-old project manager included a water leak and no grass laid in the back garden. The wardrobe doors wouldn’t shut once clothes were inside — a niggle, yes, but a deeply frustrating one.Mr Don says: ‘It was meant to be a dream home. We walked in and our dreams were spoiled.’A spokesperson for Morris Homes says: ‘As a private housebuilder of more than 70 years’ standing we take the quality of our homes very seriously and we consistently achieve high approval ratings.‘On this occasion we relaxed our strict inspection procedures to accommodate our purchaser’s desire to move in for Christmas. It was accepted that there would be minor post-completion remedials which the purchaser accepted. The images recently reported in no way reflect the property on the day of occupation.’As for Mr Buller’s issues with his sewage plant, a satisfactory resolution looks some way away.A spokesperson for Linden Homes says that when the Bullers purchased their home it was in a ‘virtually finished state’ and that they had requested an early legal completion. She says the price they paid ‘reflects the overall amenity of the plot’.She adds that the manhole covers on the plot would have been ‘clearly visible’ at the time the property was reserved.She says: ‘Mr and Mrs Buller have complained of a “sewage odour” to the rear of their property. There are no foul sewers to the rear associated with the Heathlands development.‘There are however existing foul and surface water sewers, which are the subject of imminent upgrade works by Thames Water, following complaints of unpleasant smells from residents. We have offered to commission an air quality assessment to establish the source of any odours around the property.‘In the unlikely event that the survey indicates that odours from the pump station exceed acceptable levels, we will undertake any necessary works required.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/23/4B7E48E700000578-0-image-a-17_1524783490880.jpg","title":"TSB closed branches early weekend","story":"    TSB closed some of its branches early over the weekend and turned off the lights to avoid having to deal with irate customers, it has been claimedHalf of its customers were still locked out of their online accounts last night – ten days after the bank began an ill-fated systems upgrade. Many of the 1.9million customers affected have been unable to make bank transfer payments, meaning vital bills have gone unpaid.TSB’s problems stem from a failed switch-over from the IT system of its old owner Lloyds Banking Group to one owned by its Spanish parent company Sabadell.TSB chief says the bank\u0027s IT chaos is bringing company to...One million TSB customers are STILL locked out of their...Share this articleThe bank provoked more fury as branches closed early on Saturday – the first day many workers were able to visit a branch since problems started.Branches in Hull, Lincoln, Clifton in Nottingham, Greenock, Falkirk and Elgin in Scotland were reported to have shut early.TSB in Hull closed at 1pm on Saturday when it usually shuts at 4pm.The branch then directed customers to its nearest branches 46 miles away in Doncaster or Retford in Nottinghamshire, which is 65 miles away.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

It was Pound who introduced him to vorticism, the short-lived British avant garde modernist movement created by artist and writer Wyndham Lewis as a reaction to the dominance of landscape and figurative art. Equally frustrated by the representative nature of photography, Langdon Coburn immediately sensed the liberating potential of the vorticist dynamic of geometric shapes and cubist fragmentation. In the Shape of Light, Langdon Coburn’s “vortographs”, blurred geometric arrangements of light and shadow, made using a set of mirrors to fragment the subject in an almost kaleidoscopic way, set the tone for an epic exhibition that traces the history of photography as experiment. Here, portraiture, landscape and documentary give way to abstractions – created either by manipulations of light and chemicals or by distorting or fragmenting the actual world. The result is a kind of mirror-history of the medium’s relationship to documentary and abstract art.  Spread over 12 rooms, Shape of Light is also a history of innovation, in which the darkroom and the studio are more akin to the laboratory. The early-to-mid-century masters of light and form are all present: Brassaï, Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, their embrace of abstraction a kind of compliment to their more traditional documentary work. Their often stark monochrome photographs are contrasted with the formalist paintings of Braque and Kandinsky as well as the shiny curves of a gold Brancusi sculpture, Maiastra (1911), which Steichen must surely have been aware of when he made his oddly mystical study, Bird in Space, 15 years later. It is instructive, too, to see an image from Germaine Krull’s still-undervalued series Métal (1928), a hymn to the angularity and materiality of steel, and to contrast it with the cleaner lines of Margaret Bourke-White’s ground-level view of the NBC Transmission Tower (1934). In a room entitled New Vision, the work of the great self-taught Hungarian modernist, László Moholy-Nagy, inevitably dominates. His painting K VII (1922), a minimalist arrangement of lines and blocks of colour, is echoed in an untitled photograph by him from the same year and, much later, in Mondrian’s supremely ordered arrangement of colour and form, Composition C (No 111) With Red, Yellow, Blue from 1935. Similarly in the following two rooms, the restlessly innovative imagination of Man Ray makes its presence felt. One of his mysterious rayographs from 1922 is an early example of camera-less photography made by placing everyday objects directly on to photosensitised paper and exposing them to light.Both artists cast a long shadow: Moholy-Nagy in his architectural understanding of scale, angle and detail, and his subversion of the same Man Ray in his seemingly instinctive grasp of photography as an essentially surrealist medium, capable of bending the real out of shape in astonishing ways. Bafflingly, though, there is not a trace of one of photography’s great female pioneers, Berenice Abbott, who made formally brilliant architectural photographs of modernist New York as well as pioneering scientific images of great beauty – including what she called her “rayograms-in-motion” – that surely deserved inclusion here.  In a show that tends towards the cerebral, it is a relief to encounter some more tactile nudes by Brassaï and Imogen Cunningham, in which the curves and surfaces of the female body retain a palpable sensuality. Bill Brandt’s distorted female forms, though, seem a little too forced in comparison. All three of the aforementioned artists could have featured in room eight, which is titled Surface and Texture. It begins with three images from Brassaï’s Graffiti series, in which he photographed anonymous carvings and etchings made on the walls of Paris, some recognisably representational, some abstract, all seeming to hark back to older forms of expression such as cave drawings. More intriguing still are Aaron Siskind’s photographs of cracked, peeling paint on weathered surfaces, which possess a tangible sense of materiality and a tonal quality that speaks of time passing and, with it, the slow, inexorable decay of buildings, objects and those who created them.  This is an exhibition that demands a constant attentiveness to detail and, as such, will repay a second or even third visit. The sheer amount of work on display is at times overwhelming and here and there the endless riffs on angular shapes, circles and patterns of light began to blur into a long series of slight variations on a single brilliant idea. In this context, Lewis Baltz’s almost blank minimalism is a much-needed breathing space. His evocation of the banality of postwar suburban American architecture – grey concrete surfaces in small frames – has a social, even political, undertow in that it draws attention in its deadpan way to the spread of these soulless environments. This is the mundane made abstract.  The final room is given over to contemporary abstraction and, perhaps inevitably, reflects the dilemma of current photographic practice in our profligate image culture. Both Maya Rochat and Daisuke Yokota, in their differing ways, subject their images to intense, almost destructive, transformative techniques using chemicals, heat, paint and, in Daisuke’s case, constant rephotographing, reprinting and rescanning. The visceral nature of their approach both degrades and heightens the photographic image and, by extension, the very idea of photography as a recording medium. The end results are images that are, among other things, traces of a process that is akin to improvisational music insofar as it allows, even thrives on, spontaneity and accident.  London-based Antony Cairns produces traces of a different kind, his shadow-images of London at night emanating an almost ghostly atmosphere that is both Ballardian and oddly Victorian. His silver gelatin prints are shown here behind glass plates in a large grid, each one a glimpse of a cityscape, indistinct yet recognisable, familiar yet unknowable. The ghosts of photography’s past haunt these images: the monochrome textures and shadowlands of Strand, Stieglitz, Steichen and Brassaï – the flaneurs and psychogeographers of another time who sensed the medium’s singular possibilities, not just to reflect the real, but to transform it into another kind of abstract art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765f2dcdd73ebcc0436b6ee3fa59c9402ff7c931/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f83052e1e4a714521ff753ebe83e96e","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The Korean summit, the Bill Cosby verdict, the anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and demonstrations in Gaza – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc09da67612b87d9ba2f417afb3dcd50866e1beb/0_392_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=100782d341aa260d0f9aa5714e82b377","title":"david goodall australia oldest scientist to end own life in switzerland","story":"Goodall’s decision is reigniting a debate about euthanasia in Australia where assisted suicide is illegalAustralia’s oldest scientist, who caused a stir when his university tried to vacate his office aged 102, will fly to Switzerland in early May to end his life, reigniting a national euthanasia debate.David Goodall, who is now 104, does not have a terminal illness but his quality of life has deteriorated and he has secured a fast-track appointment with an assisted dying agency in Basel, euthanasia advocates said.“I greatly regret having reached that age,” the ecologist told broadcaster ABC on his birthday earlier this month. “I’m not happy. I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.“My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide,” he added.Assisted suicide is illegal in most countries around the world and was banned in Australia until the state of Victoria became the first to legalise the practice last year.But that legislation, which takes effect from June 2019, only applies to terminally ill patients of sound mind and a life expectancy of less than six months.Other states in Australia have debated euthanasia in the past, but the proposals have always been defeated, mostly recently in New South Wales state last year.Exit International, which is helping Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia’s “oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity”.“A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it. And a person should not be forced to leave home to achieve it,” it said on its website Monday.The group has launched a GoFundMe campaign to get plane tickets for Goodall and his helper upgraded to business class from economy and has so far raised more than A$17,000 ($13,000).Goodall, an honorary research associate at Perth’s Edith Cowan University, made international headlines in 2016 when he was declared unfit to be on campus.After an uproar and support from scientists globally, the decision was reversed.He has produced dozens of research papers and until recently continued to review and edit for different ecology journals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208a1feb51ad344580b20b9246670dddeb8bca5c/0_577_1333_799/master/1333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2627a880ad7e465cb27bbf11201f1751","title":"transhumanism movement wins wellcome book prize mark o connell","story":"Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine, about humanity’s attempts to conquer death through technology, wins £30,000 prizeIrish debut author Mark O’Connell has won the Wellcome book prize for his exploration of transhumanism, a movement that seeks to use technology to solve “the modest problem of death”, as O’Connell puts it.To Be a Machine won the £30,000 award, which goes to the best work of fiction or non-fiction to “illuminate the many ways that health and medicine touch our lives”, at a ceremony in London on Monday night. O’Connell’s book saw off competition that included the Nigerian author Ayòbámi Adébáyò, nominated for Stay With Me, a novel about sickle cell disease, and Sigrid Rausing’s memoir about the impact of addiction on her family, Mayhem.Chair of judges Edmund de Waal called To Be a Machine a “passionate, entertaining and cogent examination of those who would choose to live for ever”.To Be a Machine sees the 38-year-old O’Connell meet with those working to conquer mortality through technology – from the self-proclaimed cyborgs who insert tech implants beneath their skin, to the developers trying to translate human minds into code. Exploring the beliefs and work of several high-profile transhumanists, including PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, inventor Elon Musk and Google’s head of engineering Ray Kurzweil, O’Connell also examines the philosophy and science behind the movement, as well as the opportunities and concerns it may create in the future.“What are my chances, would you say, of living to 1,000?” the author asks gerontologist Aubrey de Grey. “I would say perhaps a little better than fifty-fifty,” de Grey replies. “It’s very much dependent on the level of funding.”De Waal said: “Mark O’Connell brilliantly examines issues of technology and singularity. In doing so he brings into focus timely issues about mortality, what it might mean to be a machine and what it truly means to be human. It is also unequivocally readable, in that what it does is address hugely complicated areas of new science to do with AI and ethics, simultaneously. That’s very remarkable, to be able to traverse bits of cutting-edge scientific research and make something that is funny, engaged, cogent and lucid, all at the same time.”O’Connell, a journalist, essayist and literary critic, “hasn’t got multiple PhDs in this area,” said de Waal. “What he does have, which is critical, is an absolutely ferocious, forensic, enquiring mind. He drills down into what people are saying and gets them to reveal all kinds of complicated and ambiguous aspects to do with their desires and their aspirations. He looks at scientific discoveries through the messiness of human desire. That’s really difficult to do.”Previous winners of the Wellcome prize include Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and Marion Coutts’s The Iceberg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aeef2b8e471635f539ae6edc496e71be2df84d6/17_14_3435_2062/master/3435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3d2978eae424e832f57d6449100209c","title":"experts have their say on sainsburys asda merger","story":"From fears about job losses to a view of two businesses trying to ‘future-proof themselves’Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB:Hundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like ‘rationalisation’ in the name of ‘efficiency’.

In a speech about the possibilities created by big data, Haldane said it was “devilishly difficult” to work out how people felt because traditional surveys of market participants or the general public tended to be “biased in their sampling and framed in their responses”.He said researchers were using non-traditional methods in an attempt to understand consumer behaviour.“To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people’s sentiment.”Haldane said the results were at least as good at tracking consumer sentiment as the monthly Michigan University survey, which is considered by economists to be a good guide to how confident Americans are feeling.Multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft already had “primitive” economies attached to them that economists were studying, not only to gauge the public mood but also to assess how iniduals would respond to policy changes such as moves in interest rates or tougher regulations.“Indeed, in the latter role, the game could serve as a test bed for policy action – a large-scale dynamic, digital focus group.”Haldane noted that not all attempts to harness online searches have been successful. Google tried to predict flu outbreaks based on online searches with little success after a promising start.But he expressed confidence that big data would fulfil its promise and help the Bank of England “to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather.“Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows.

John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: “Ultimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices … customers will see reduced choice.”However, responding to an urgent question about the deal in parliament, the business minister, Andrew Griffiths, appeared to support the merger, saying the two grocers were trying “to get ahead of the curve” in a competitive market.The proposed merger of the UK’s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major competition inquiry. Analysts predicted that if the deal was approved, it would result in at least 75 store disposals to ensure competition did not suffer. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since Morrison bought Safeway in 2003, when dozens of stores changed hands.Sainsbury’s said the merger would not be completed until the second half of 2019 as regulators will have to calculate the potential overlaps between the two groups’ stores and the impact on local competition. Coupe, who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a “transformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future”. He insisted the merger would be “a great deal for everyone”, with benefits for customers, staff, suppliers and shareholders.Coupe said the retail landscape had changed dramatically since the MorrisonsSafeway deal, with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl and online specialists led by Amazon.“It’s never been more competitive and customers have more choices than ever, not just in the grocery sector but in other retail sectors. You can see the consequences of that playing out every day,” Coupe said.The CMA confirmed the deal would be subject to investigation and Sainsbury’s said it had asked the watchdog to skip straight to a detailed “phase two” stage.Coupe said regulators would be mainly concerned by the impact on consumers who, he said, would benefit from lower prices and more choice in deciding how they shopped as a result of investment in technology. He said the merger would deliver at least £500m in cost savings and other benefits, largely as a result of improved efficiency and better deals with suppliers.John Hannett, the general secretary of the Usdaw union, said: “Both companies operate significant nationwide distribution networks employing thousands of staff. We will be seeking urgent clarification on the future for those workers.” Coupe admitted that some head office functions were likely to be combined over time but insisted new jobs would also be created. Asda will continue to be run from Leeds with its own chief executive, likely to be the current boss, Roger Burnley, who only recently joined Asda from Sainsbury’s.Coupe insisted that the Sainsbury’s brand, which has prided itself on better welfare and food quality standards, would not be damaged by the association with Walmart, an international retail giant best known for its low prices.The deal enables Walmart, which bought Asda nearly 20 years ago, to take a step back from the UK market, where it is struggling to compete with Aldi and Lidl as well as Tesco, which controls almost a third of the grocery market.Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said: “We believe this combination will create a dynamic new retail player better positioned for even more success in a fast-changing and competitive UK market.”She said Walmart was interested in expanding the Sainsbury’s-owned Argos chain internationally and could help the combined business by introducing new technology and better deals on non-food goods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e73c40fbf134863ac5f9d47e5fb4af5da97f76/0_0_1417_1876/master/1417.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aadf86a9a20d766a807b7958db537091 1320w","title":"the guardian view on amber rudds resignation now change the policy","story":"This was a textbook example of the press holding government to account and a classic illustration of the importance of that effort. But it is not just Ms Rudd who was exposed by it. It was also the policy itself. The wish to expel an arbitrary level of illegal migrants managed to catch hundreds of legal arrivals – notably the Windrush-era migrants who arrived without modern papers – in the net. That should not have happened and it must cease.The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, must therefore change the policy as a priority. He made an effective start in the Commons on Monday, with a pledge to do “whatever it takes” to give justice and security to the Windrush cases. But he faces practical obligations too, including a comprehensive support and compensation programme for the Windrush families. He must also end a target culture that may encourage a culture of disbelief among officials. And he must provide a new adjudication system, with checks and balances, for handling cases, in order to reduce injustices. These are large challenges, but they are also a big opportunity to press the reset button.Targets are not wrong in principle. They can be useful tools for measuring the quantity and quality of delivery. But targets must also be fair, credible and should be understood and explained in the public interest. The hostile environment targets were none of these things. They were indiscriminate, unachievable and riddled with too much injustice and fear.Ms Rudd’s approach to them was cynical. She adopted fierce targets because that was the line of least resistance, politically speaking. It allowed her to prove her support for their ultimate author Theresa May, whom she rightly supported against the recklessness of the dogmatic Brexiters. But she also seemed a reluctant believer, unable and unwilling to make the case for them. In the end she was caught out saying one thing to one audience and a different thing to another. She should not have followed the policy in the first place – the public can sometimes be much fairer than politicians imagine – and she should not have blamed her officials when it all went wrong.Ms Rudd is a liberal pro-European Conservative. Her fall has been an object lesson in the perils facing liberal Tories when they allow cheap rightwing rhetoric to outweigh their better and more practical instincts in important areas of public policymaking. The Home Office has increasingly found itself an arena for this dilemma in recent decades. Successive home secretaries of all parties have lapsed into gesture politics and facile toughness rather than thinking calmly, strategically and effectively. They have been encouraged to do this by the tightness of public money in a continuingly low tax age, and by the tendency of political leaders, in the absence of expanding state welfare and spending projects, to try to justify themselves to an anxious public and a febrile press in more authoritarian ways. Yet it simply does not have be this way.Ms Rudd is the fourth member of Mrs May’s post-election cabinet, and its second senior woman, to go in just over 10 months. The wastage rate is high. It indicates the fragility of the cabinet, the government and the Tory party. It does not bode well for the Tories in the local elections. What it says above all, though, is that this government currently lacks the confidence, ability and shrewdness to generate effective and routinely fair policy delivery, making lives better and strengthening social solidarity. That is the larger task that Mr Javid must undertake if he can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70bfac1fa7a9c5da5a8e47177de448ba47e78131/0_0_1128_677/master/1128.jpg?w=1000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d421bb6fcbb9ab0a43bf6f0f02dd82ed 1000w","title":"time for a riot how the art of 1968 caught a world in turmoil","story":"It was the year hippy idealism gave way to riot and struggle – with protests in Paris, tanks in Prague and black power in the US.  writers pick the pivotal works from that tumultuous timeOn 19 August 1968, Josef Koudelka returned to Czechoslovakia from Romania, where he had been living among and photographing Romany Gypsies. The following day, Soviet tanks appeared on the streets of Prague. For seven days, the 30-year-old Moravian-born photographer roamed the city with his East German Exakta Varex camera loaded with movie film, the only stock he could find at short notice.The resulting images, some of which were smuggled out of the country, but many of which were not seen until decades later, captured the tumult of a traumatised city. They are recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century.Koudelka photographed teenagers blocking the paths of Soviet tanks, old people imploring the young Soviet soldiers to return home, flag-waving youths clambering over army vehicles. He returned to his apartment only to find more film or succumb to exhaustion. His images of defiance have, in the interim, become infused with a romantic, even elegiac quality. Their atmosphere is echoed in photographs of more recent upheavals, most notably the Arab Spring protests.This image, which he titled Hand and Wristwatch, is of a different order: a singular moment of calm and stillness. Here, there is no movement, no noise, only the almost empty street and that anonymous arm in the foreground, stretching out into the frame. It captures not just the moment the troops entered Prague but also the eerie atmosphere of an entire city and country helplessly losing its sense of itself.Look closely and you can see a small group of people who have left their work to gather on the pavement. In the background, those blurry vehicles may be tanks. Everything is uncertain here except the hand of a passerby, curled into a fist, and the hands of the watch that signal the moment when everything changed utterly for the citizens of the invaded city. This may be Koudelka’s only conceptual photograph, but it resonates as an iconic image of a tumultuous political moment in which there is no tumult – only an eerie silence in which time itself seems to have come to a halt. Sean O’Hagan The events of 1968 took some time to percolate through pop: it wasn’t until a year later that Thunderclap Newman would reach No 1 with a song urging the listener to “hand out the arms and ammo … because the revolution’s here”, and that a mood of increasing militancy would really start being reflected by black artists. Of the musicians who did react quickly to 1968’s tumult, the Rolling Stones were audibly re-energised and the Beatles baffled – “you can count me out … in,” sang John Lennon on Revolution. The most incendiary music made in immediate response to the year’s events, a recording of Nina Simone performing at the Westbury Music Fair three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination, was bowdlerised before being released, not least to remove the sound of Simone urging the audience to avenge King’s death by any means: “I ain’t about to be non-violent, honey.”Meanwhile, released in September 1968 – in the aftermath of the Miami riots and the Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago – Jefferson Airplane’s The House at Pooneil Corners offers the sound of hippy idealism curdling into something infinitely darker. It opens with scraping guitar noise, before an ominous, lumbering two-chord riff strikes up. The lyrics bemoan both “all the bullshit around us” and the counterculture’s desire to “get balled and high”: “You say it’s healing, but nobody’s feeling it … you say you don’t see and you don’t”. After two minutes, in lieu of the usual guitar solo, there’s a lengthy electronic wail that sounds like a siren, and the tone is increasingly apocalyptic: “There will be no survivors, my friend”.By the song’s conclusion, the lyrics are positing that a post-human world where “all the idiots have left” will be a kind of naive pastoral utopia replete with cows and turtle doves, but the music tells a different story: it just grinds relentlessly on and on, with more siren-like feedback, more keening guitars. It’s effective because it feels like an honest reaction to the events of 1968: not a strident call for revolution, nor a glib attempt to assure listeners that it’s going to be all right, but the sound of people clearly shaken and confused: peering, terrified, into the void. Alexis PetridisOn 22 November 1968, Star Trek boldly went where no primetime programme had gone before when it aired the first scripted interracial kiss on American TV, in an episode entitled Plato’s Stepchildren. It was not, it should be said, the most romantic of embraces Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) are forced into it by evil aliens with telekinetic powers. Thanks to some artful camera angles you don’t actually see their lips touch and the moment is very brief.But while the kiss may only have lasted a second, it represented decades of progress in regard to race relations in the States. It aired towards the end of the civil rights movement, after several hard-won legal milestones made African Americans slightly more equal under the law. In 1954, segregation was made illegal in public schools. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting. In 1967, Loving v Virginia made anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional and rendered interracial marriage legal across the US. In April 1968, days after Martin Luther King was assassinated, the Fair Housing Act was passed, preventing housing discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and religion.It would be nice to say that Kirk and Uhura’s kiss represented a turning point in the US. That the revolution had, indeed, been televised and centuries of racial injustice were over, sealed with a kiss. However, 50 years later, depressingly little has changed. US public schools are more segregated now than they were during the civil rights movement, according to a 2013 report. And, that same year, a Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family generated so much racist abuse it made headlines.“Where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference,” Kirk told one of the evil aliens in Plato’s Stepchildren. That’s certainly not true now. Let’s hope things change sometime before the 2360s. Arwa MahdawiLandmark shows don’t have to be masterpieces. Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi is a piece of anarchic juvenilia but its Paris premiere in 1896 is accepted as the starting point of the theatre of the absurd. Similarly there may be better musicals than Hair but its opening at Shaftesbury theatre in London on 27 September 1968 (having been seen earlier that year on Broadway) was a political event for two closely connected reasons. The show not only built a popular musical out of protest. It was also the first production to capitalise on the abolition of theatrical censorship which had constricted the British stage since 1737.In those far-off days, all works had to be licensed for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, one of whose readers, in proposing a ban, reported of Hair: “It extols dirt, anti-Establishment views, homosexuality, free love, drug-taking and it inveighs against patriotism.” Actually, that’s a pretty accurate description of a show in which Claude, the son of uptight American parents, rejects the world of work and military induction to join a hippie tribe. Ultimately unable to dodge the draft, he ends up uniformed, hair-shorn and dead. The critic and director Charles Marowitz got it right when he wrote of Hair: “It is the most powerful piece of anti-war propaganda yet to come out of America. Without Vietnam and the American repugnance to that war, the show would never have come into being.”In Britain, there was a good deal of prurient interest in the show’s brief flash of nudity. But that was much less important than its rejection of the death-dealing values of the military-industrial complex and its celebration of life. Hair may have been prompted by anti-war feeling but the book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and the music by Galt MacDermot are joyous rather than jaded. The opening and closing choruses of Aquarius and Let the Sunshine In ring with jubilation. The best moment comes when Hamlet’s “what a piece of work is a man” is turned into an affirmative song for three voices.From today’s perspective, the show’s faith in flower power and chemical experiments may seem naive but no piece of theatre better captures the political mood of the late 60s than this “tribal, love-rock musical”. Michael Billington In 1970 the American choreographer Yvonne Rainer staged an elegant anti-war version of her signature work, Trio A, during which her dancers performed naked with just the United States flag draped ironically around their necks. Rainer’s protest against US involvement in Vietnam would be followed, over the next decade, by a spate of politically conscious dance-making on both sides of the Atlantic. But at the start of 1968, militant acts of choreography tended to focus on the artform itself, re-evaluating the language and conventions of dance.Many of those militants were former students of Merce Cunningham, who was dedicated to the possibilities of pure movement. Cunningham was, in theory, the least political of choreographers. Yet he was always intensely alive to the world outside his studio, and RainForest, created in the spring of 1968, remains a prime example of how dance can become so porous to the zeitgeist that it becomes expressive, even prophetic of history.Much about the work is evocative of its title. David Tudor’s semi-improvised score is a dark forest of buzzing, squawking sound there’s a feral strangeness to many of the dancers’ movements as they crouch, stretch and stalk the stage and overhead the silver balloons of Andy Warhol’s set design cluster like a canopy of light reflecting leaves. It’s those balloons that take RainForest out of its exotic habitat into the unruly party spirit of the late 60s. Some of them are free-floating, so they bob around the stage whenever the performers happen to nudge or brush against them some even fly into the audience. In RainForest there’s a spirit of transformative anarchy at work that not only liberates its dancers from the ordinary rules of human engagement but from the normal constraints of performance. No showing of the work can ever be the same: the sheer chanciness of its construction makes it an embodiment of perpetual possibility and change. Judith Mackrell If any one movie is saturated with the political spirit of 1968, it has to be Jean-Luc Godard’s bizarre, wayward, instructive documentary about the Rolling Stones, entitled One Plus One and later recut and released in a more commercial version (which Godard angrily disowned) named Sympathy for the Devil, in honour of the famous track from the album Beggars Banquet that the Stones are shown recording. When the London film festival attempted to show this version, Godard denounced it from the stage and stalked out, punching the producer on the way.The film is a time capsule. Break it open and an overpowering and unwholesome fume of radical chic and 1968-ness rises from it: fascinating, infuriating. Godard himself became the charismatic face of radicalism that year in March 1968 he led – along with François Truffaut – the anti-Gaullist demonstrations in Paris against the sacking of the Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois which ended in scuffles with the police, Godard’s glasses being smashed, and a combustible situation that materially led to the greater disturbances of May.That summer, he went to London and made his One Plus One: long, unedited real-time sequences of the Stones rehearsing and recording in the studio. No rows or disruptions, though at one stage poor old Charlie Watts gets it in the neck from Mick for his drumming sounding “a bit dead”. But these shots are interspersed and juxtaposed with other sequences: a group of Black Panthers hang out in a junkyard, reading revolutionary texts, passing around weapons and stagily humiliating various submissive women. (The casual misogyny of the era is on display).Godard’s wife Anne Wiazemsky, named “Eve Democracy”, is shown drifting through woodland, laconically answering yes or no to questions from a camera crew. (“Do you think the lower classes have more sexual vitality than the upper classes?” Answer: yes.) A lone figure is shown spraying graffiti in her room at the Park Lane Hilton and then around the streets of London, shown in all their social-realist bleakness: slogans like CINEMARXISM and SOVIETCONG. A weird voice reads from political, pulp and pornographic novels. In a comic book store people give each other Nazi salutes.And what of the Stones? Before the last scene, Godard flashes up the famous graffiti slogan: “Beneath the stones, the beach” punningly hinting that the Stones have the real spirit of 68. But his invocation of the Black Panthers is also a coded denunciation of their appropriating black music. The poses that Godard strikes in this film, and the longueurs between them, are exasperating, though like so many Godard films, this one now shows – I believe – his affinity with conceptual art, as much as cinema. It also shows the strange, tense moodiness of the times: the simmering sense of disorder: jittery, euphoric, but with an edge of bleary cynicism, like the voice of Jagger’s Lucifer.

Half of the money was to come from the taxpayer, with the rest matched by the private sector, according to an announcement in the autumn budget.However, nearly half a year later, it has emerged that the government has not even started the recruitment process for an official to raise the £200m of private investment – let alone begin the process of securing the funding. “We expect to launch the procurement for the private sector fund manager in summer 2018,” Robert Jenrick, a junior Treasury minister, said.In a written parliamentary answer, he said the government had been busy engaging with the private sector to ensure the fund was “set up in the most effective way”.Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “The government’s electric vehicles policy has run out of power before leaving the driveway. Ministers failed to admit they hadn’t secured a penny of investment and didn’t intend to raise anything in the near future. They have announced £200m that isn’t theirs and hasn’t been promised to them.”The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had called the support a “positive step to boost buyer confidence”.Electric vehicles are also a cornerstone of efforts to tackle dirty air in cities. Ministers have lost three legal battles over their failure to clean up air pollution as quickly as possible, as required under EU law.A delay to the government’s £400m electric charging plan could hamper efforts to reduce pollution from cars. There are about 16,000 charging points in the UK, for more than 130,000 plug-in hybrid and pure electric cars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1bb23224e08bb948029743b524333069647a348/0_136_4078_2447/master/4078.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e4d7707db8e46ede8dcf26b9a62ada","title":"juup heynckes denies real madrid complex but calls for bayern efficiency","story":"At the end of the final session at Bayern Munich’s Säbener Strasse training ground their players took penalties but Jupp Heynckes said it had nothing to do with the prospect of a shootout at the Bernabéu on Tuesday night.Instead, their manager claimed, the explanation was simpler than that: the practice match had finished in a draw. Heynckes said there was no way to recreate the pressure and tension of penalties and dismissed Franz Beckenbauer’s suggestion that Bayern have a “complex” when it comes to Real Madrid but he did appeal for his side to seek “inner peace” as they arrived in Spain looking to reach the Champions League final on 26\u0026nbspMay.Bayern were defeated 2-1 in Munich but Heynckes believes the first leg showed Madrid could be “hurt” and welcomed the prospect of the semi‑final being decided from 12 yards. Although he said there would be small changes, he insisted that above all his side needed to be more “efficient” than in the first leg, during which they racked up 18 shots but finished with a sixth successive defeat against their European rivals – a run that includes two in last season’s quarter-finals. Bayern lost 2-1 at home then as well but levelled the aggregate score in Madrid, taking the tie into extra time before being defeated 4-2.“Everyone saw we were defeated by two offside goals,” Thomas Müller said but the club’s honorary president had suggested there might be a different explanation. “There will never be a time when it’s so easy to beat them they weren’t brilliant,” Beckenbauer claimed three days ago. “I fear we have a complex with Madrid.”The other major problem they have is injuries: Jérôme Boateng, Arturo Vidal, Arjen Robben, Kingsley Coman and Manuel Neuer are absent.“Recent losses play no part, because I wasn’t the coach then and tomorrow is a different team from last year,” Heynckes said. “For all of us here, what other people say is irrelevant – even if it is our president. This season we have shown we can be successful in close games and tomorrow will be very difficult for us but I think it will be for Real Madrid, too.“I have a lot of players with experience, internationals who have had success, and we come here to take our chance. We face a team that has been champion two years in a row, three times in four years, and are used to big games, but we never surrender and we want to be in the final. Faith moves mountains. If you want to win the Champions League, you have to have talent, good players, luck in the draw and in certain moments the right referee.“We have to have balance between attack and defence. Even if it sounds comic, we have to find an inner peace, that balance we had in 2013. I think we have a better squad now but in these big games we need leaders, people who step forward. That’s the art of great players.”It was put to Müller that he had never scored against Madrid and that Robert Lewandowski’s failure to score in the first leg had cost Bayern. “If you don’t win, people always look for a scapegoat. If we don’t score, people look at Lewandowski. But he has 28 goals and he is undisputed, a great striker. Ronaldo didn’t score in the first game either,” he said. “I didn’t know I hadn’t scored against Madrid. Maybe that’s extra motivation but personal stats don’t interest me much if the result is good without me scoring, fine. Although it wouldn’t be bad to score.”Zinedine Zidane, meanwhile, vowed that Madrid would attack, not seek to protect the lead, even if Sergio Ramos did claim that the most important factor would be “defensive seriousness” and that the counterattack might be key. Despite the probable absence of Isco and injury to Dani Carvajal, Zidane said: “Bayern are a great team and will go for it. We have to go out there to win, to score as soon as we can, without dropping back at all, without trying to contain the game or doing anything odd.”Asked which opponent he would prevent from playing if he could, Bayern’s former Madrid midfielder James Rodríguez said: “I’d take all 11 out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d557062a207bfbf3765c71526f44992eb0b94828/0_44_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1ae86cb2ac1d9f0188b8510cc06410","title":"tottenham hotspur watford premier league match report","story":"If the result is all that matters at this late stage of the season, then Tottenham will reflect on this low-key victory with a measure of satisfaction. It did not bother Mauricio Pochettino that there were times when his bruised players tried too hard to extinguish their disappointment at failing to reach the FA Cup final. They still won with plenty left in the tank and, in the end, this was a timely reminder that the modern Tottenham possess more resolve than many of their predecessors.That is why Pochettino likes to speak about this young team’s development. The Argentinian has hardened their mentality and, while Tottenham’s wait for their first trophy since 2008 will not end this season, the bottom line is that they can guarantee a top-four finish by beating West Brom on Saturday and Newcastle next Wednesday.Dele Alli’s opener provided them with a springboard to move five points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea and Tottenham will pip Liverpool to third place if they win their final three matches. They endured some awkward moments here and Watford, who are still not arithmetically safe from relegation, felt aggrieved not to have won for the first time since 3 March. Harry Kane’s 38th goal of the season killed off Javi Gracia’s side, though, and left Pochettino praising his team’s response to losing their FA Cup semi-final to Manchester United last weekend.“It is important in the last few games that we win,” Pochettino said. “We were all disappointed. Our fans the same. You felt it. I am so proud of the mentality and commitment they showed.”The game was played in a subdued atmosphere, with plenty of empty seats dotted around the ground, and Spurs were often there for the taking. There was a slight air of edginess about their play and Pochettino frowned at his team’s tentativeness in the final third, especially when Kane spurned a decent shooting opportunity with an awkward piece of control in the 12th minute. Watford sensed an opportunity to exploit that unease, showing inventiveness on the break, and Spurs’ defenders were relieved to see Hugo Lloris deny Andre Gray in the 25th minute.The frustration for Watford, however, was that one defensive aberration had already undermined their enterprising approach by the time Gray saw his snapshot pushed away.A team with Tottenham’s attacking options rarely require a helping hand from their opponents and Orestis Karnezis will wince when he watches a replay of the mistake that handed the home team an undeserved lead.The threat looked minimal when Kieran Trippier whipped a cross towards the near post from the right flank. It should have been a routine catch for Karnezis. Instead, the Watford goalkeeper was distracted by Christian Kabasele ducking underneath the ball and his fumble presented Christian Eriksen with the chance to tee up Alli, who drove a low shot into the unguarded net.However, Pochettino was mistaken if he thought that isolated show of composure from Alli would settle his players. Watford targeted Tottenham’s unconvincing high line, forcing Lloris to race out of his area to beat Abdoulaye Doucouré to a through-ball, and all that was missing was a touch of ruthlessness.A lovely backheel from Will Hughes released Doucouré, who shot straight at Lloris, and Richarlison also had an effort pushed away after combining with Gray. “We conceded a few chances but Lloris showed fantastic skills in goal,” Pochettino said. His side would make Watford regret their generosity. “We conceded cheap goals,” Gracia said. “When we created chances we didn’t score.”Tottenham emerged with renewed focus at the start of the second half and normal service was resumed when Kane made it 2-0. The goal stemmed from one of those flowing moves that have made Spurs so enjoyable to watch under Pochettino, Eriksen shuffling a pass to Alli, who poked the ball through to Son Heung-min on the left. Son wasted no time turning the ball across goal and, although Kane slipped in the middle, the striker sprung back to his feet to meet Trippier’s centre with a crisp shot.Watford, winless on their travels since 25 November, had been put in their place. Richarlison contrived to fire over from close range and Gerard Deulofeu had a goal correctly ruled out for offside. But despite losing Mousa Dembélé to an ankle injury, Tottenham closed out the game after Kane’s goal.The striker has looked out of sorts since returning from an ankle injury and he is still playing himself back into form. Yet his importance to this team has never been in doubt and, with Gareth Southgate in the stands, this was a good time for England’s best hope at the World Cup to rediscover his scoring touch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c01e341f4d417e3dd5fbb10c9e237a8a4a7cea7/158_121_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a343110df8e86a131b31305428458618","title":"tottenham v watford premier league live","story":"Tottenham were unconvincing but managed to win all the same, as Watford gifted them an opening goal and missed a few chances of their ownAnd with that, I’m done. Bye!Mauricio Pochettino is pleased, but not too pleased. He’s about a six on the pleasedness scale.I think it was a good night for us, because the opportunity was to take the three points, which allows us to be in a good position in the table. Today was a must win game, so important for us. Maybe we didn’t play in the way we wanted to play. Our performance wasn’t great but most important was the three points.In 10 months of competition it’s difficult to keep playing good football. We tried. I think Watford was a very difficult opponent. They played well, created some great chances. Hugo Lloris was fantastic, there were a few situations that showed why he’s one of the best keepers in the world. The three points put us in a really strong position.It was Monday night, difficult to play. Of course the team came from a difficult week, very disappointed after Manchester. It was a difficult game. Watford had no pressure, because I think they are safe. Of course they tried to play with freedom and for us there was massive pressure to take the three points. Three points put us in a really strong situation. To finish in the top four for a third time in a row would be massive for the club.Watford’s Javi Gracia looks rueful. This is what he’s got to say. It may be helpful to know that Watford’s highest finishing position in the Premier League is 13th:Today it was frustrating because I think again we competed very well. In the first half we created many chances to score and Tottenham with their first chance score, and after that you are playing against a very good team. It was very difficult in the second half.I am surprised because we are not scoring goals in this moment, but we are creating many chances, in all the games. We are competing. We had good performances, but it is not enough to get points. We need to continue.We conceded cheaply, in our box. And we weren’t able to score goals in the other box. And then, if you don’t have the control of the boxes, it’s difficult to win.I’m focused on the next game, on trying if it’s possible to improve the best position in the Premier League the club ever got. It’s our target at the moment. Focus on the next game against Newcastle and try to take three points.Here’s a match report from Wembley:It was OK. Obviously it was important that we won the game. But we could have played better. We could have moved it quicker and we were lucky to be ahead at half-time. Second half we were better, but I still thought we could have been quicker between the lines.It feels like ages since we last played. Our run of form hasn’t been the best and when that happens you want to play straight away and make it right. We started a bit slow. But we won the game and that’s what we’re happy about. We’ve got three games left and if we win them all we can jump up to third. That’s the aim now.Chelsea were creeping up. Now we can look forward. It was important just to get the job done tonight, ease that pressure and now we can look forward to the next few games.I feel good. I’d have liked to have played better over the last few games, but the hwole team would have liked to do that. I feel good, I feel sharp. I’m looking forward to the last three games. Hopefully I can finish strong and go into a big summer.Good stat here, shamelessly stolen from Bill Edgar of the Times:Watford goal tallies in away games since late last season:Watford’s dismal away run continues, but that was a reasonably promising performance. They have a very decent midfield, with Chalobah still to come, and if they can totally reinvent their attack they’d be a pretty good side. Though by then, if rumours are to be believed, Doucouré will have gone, Richarlison might have followed, and they’ll need to rebuild that midfield again.Spurs are now five points ahead of Chelsea in the battle for a top four place, and if they can beat West Brom at the weekend they’re home and hosed.90+7 mins: Not vintage Tottenham, or anywhere near it, but it’ll do.90+5 mins: One final chance for Watford, and one final shot straight at Lloris. This time it’s from Carillo, who exchanges passes with Deulofeu, gets into the area, carries the ball until the angle is unpromisingly acute and then blasts at the nearest goalkeeper.90+2 mins: Mariappa’s long crossfield pass is headed by Trippier straight to Deeney, who chests down and, from 20 yards, shoots high. Watford haven’t worn their shooting boots tonight – every effort has been either straight at Lloris, or nowhere near him.90+1 mins: Carillo cuts in from the left, works space well and then sends a left-footed shot curling into the nearest defender.90+1 mins: There will be six more minutes of this.90 mins: Spurs miss a chance for a third! Kane comes in from the left and this time finds a fine pass that slices through the defence and finds Sissoko in the penalty area. He takes a touch and then shoots high and wide.89 mins: The introduction of Deeney and Deulofeu revitalised Watford, but they and the game faded a long while back.89 mins: Lamela runs into the area, loses the ball, wins it back again, is forced out wide and eventually runs out of pitch. Watford have a throw-in.87 mins: Kane cuts inside from the left and blooters a right-footed shot into Row X.86 mins: Watford keep the ball for a long while, though Spurs are working admirably hard to deprive of them of easy routes forward. They eventually get to the edge of the penalty area, but then give it away.83 mins: The night’s final substitution sees Will Hughes makes way for Andre Carillo.82 mins: Richarlison is back on the pitch, but Dele Alli is going off it – Lamela is coming on.80 mins: Now we know how many shots Watford have had away from home since they last scored. Sixty shots! Sixty! And counting!78 mins: Capoue is fouled, and Watford send the ball into the penalty area. It’s headed out but straight to Hughes, whose volleyed shot heads wide and spins wider, eventually staying iin play near the corner flag.77 mins: He’s up now, and he’s moving easily enough. Whether he’s seeing equally well is less clear – he’s got a nasty cut above his eye.77 mins: Trippier has recovered, but Richarlison is still on the ground.75 mins: Spurs make a second change, Sissoko coming on for Son. Seconds later Trippier and Richarlison leap for a high ball and head each other, and both require treatment.74 mins: Now Spurs have a goal disallowed, after Vertonghen, on the edge of the penalty area, pulls the ball down nicely and passes to the unmarked but offside Kane, who curls in.73 mins: Both of Tottenham’s goals have been assisted by poor defending andor calamitous goalkeeping. Watford meanwhile have created more than enough chances to have at least matched their goal tally.71 mins: Now Deulofeu is played in. He takes the ball past Lloris, turns the ball into the net and is given offside. Replays suggest the decision was very close, but correct.71 mins: Richarlison is a bright young talent, but really a professional footballer has to be scoring there.70 mins: Holebas crosses from the left, Deeney heads down and Richarlison, from the edge of the six-yard box, gets under the ball and blazes it way, way high.70 mins: Ridiculous, impossible miss from Richarlison!69 mins: Watford break well, but Deeney doesn’t see Hughes enjoying the freedom of the right half of the pitch and instead of setting up a clear chance turns back into traffic.68 mins: Spurs hit the post! From a free kick on the right Trippier crosses excellently, and Vertonghen rises at the far post to head back across goal but into the woodwork! It bounces back into play, but Watford hack clear.67 mins: Deulofeu gets into space on the left, but tries to cut back to Richarlison when a cross would have been a better idea, and Spurs intercept.66 mins: Watford win another free kick, Alli thumps the ball away in disappointment, and somehow he isn’t booked."},{"url":null,"title":"best new android iphone games 2018","story":"Be a neighbourhood god in The Sims Mobile, a Viking hero in Oddmar or start a craft beer empire in Brew Town. Along with Fortnite, Evoland 2, Trick Shot 2 and more new mobile games to tryThe first Evoland was essentially a megamix of the best bits from the history of role-playing games, from monochrome Game Boy questing to Final Fantasy-style battles. The sequel continues in that vein, packing in knowing references for long-time game and anime fans without bamboozling everyone else. From pixel-art platforming to 3D open-world exploring, Evoland 2 sends you through a montage of fun moments, both familiar and novel.A playground craze the likes of which we’ve not seen since Minecraft, Fortnite is a colourful, rather creative battle-royale shooter: 100 players begin a match, one remains at the end. Where Fortnite prevails over its rival PUBG, which also appeared on phones this month, is that it feels natural on a touchscreen, from the smart placement of the on-screen buttons to double-tap gestures that make aiming while running painless. You might download it for your kids, but you’ll want to play it yourself.Oddmar sounds like a standard action game about a Viking hero searching for his lost village while ridding the local forest of critters. What sets it apart is the sheer craft that’s gone into it, from its super-smooth animation as Oddmar leaps through the 24 beautiful (and visually varied) levels to its finely honed touch controls – often an Achilles heel for this genre on mobile. You can breeze through in a matter of hours, but the challenges on each level – from collecting coins to finishing as quickly as possible – give you more for your money.Building on the crafting’n’survival principles that Minecraft popularised and countless other games have refined and experimented with, The Bonfire: Forsaken Lands has you building a settlement in a snowy wasteland by day, then protecting it from monster attacks by night. This day-night cycle gives the game an enthralling rhythm, as you unlock new buildings to craft and uncover more of its story (which, although it falls into the “mysterious ancient civilisations” trope, isn’t too stale).Mobile gamers have been playing neighbourhood-god in The Sims: FreePlay, a cut-down version of the life-simulator Sims games on PC tuned for smartphone habits, since late 2011. It’s now been superseded by The Sims Mobile, which is much closer to the bigger, better PC games. It suits the rhythm of mobile play (short bursts rather than long sessions), letting you micromanage your Sim people and see their work, love lives and home decor evolve. There are energy meters and a timer that locks you out of the game, both designed to nudge you towards in-app purchases, but it nonetheless retains the magnetism of the PC games as your community develops.2015’s Trick Shot was a slow-burning hit: a set of minimalist physics puzzles created by one of the designers of Monument Valley. This sequel keeps the stripped-down “get the ball in the box” idea, with a think-test-repeat dynamic to making best use of the buttons, teleporters, levers and other items. The inclusion of a level editor is heartening too. The majority of players may not have the patience to create their own puzzles, but the ones that do can share them with the community – which should ensure a steady supply of new trick shots to master.“A dark world plagued by beasts and demons” is a setup we’ve seen before, but never quite in this context. Keep in Mind’s hero is Jonas, whose own darkness encompasses alcoholism and depression. His night-time “mirror” world is the key to confronting his issues. The developer created the game for playersfacing their own mental-health issues, and it deserves a wide audience. The exploration and monster interactions are relatively simple, but the message stays with you long after you’ve completed it.One of the first big App Store hits in 2008 was a novelty app to pour a virtual pint. 10 years later, we have games about brewing craft beer. This sits in an accessible spot between full business simulation and mobile-friendly “clicker” game, with a smooth path from your first brew to a thriving business. It’s impossible not to be enjoyably sidetracked by the game’s label-designer section, welding decals, shapes and lettering together for your own ugly-beautiful beer labels.Alto’s Adventure, from 2015, was a beautiful-looking, endless snowboarding game, but developer Snowman has swapped snow for sand for the sequel, with a desert theme providing plenty more scenery to gawp at. You’ll be swooping down slopes, flipping somersaults while airborne, and avoiding obstacles from rock-piles to chasms, taking in sunsets and storms. It’s calming and meditative, with a zen mode that strips out the scoring aspect for an even more relaxed experience.If you ’re familiar with Final Fantasy XV, it’s unlikely you’ll want to play it on a phone, but this edition is an excellent introduction for everyone else. It is a unique and endearing mix of road trip and Japanese fantasy, starring a boyband-esque group of friends who spend as much time tooling around in an open-topped sports car as they do battling monsters. It’s simplified well for touchscreens: the characters fight for themselves, with you influencing the action through well-timed taps to dodge, block and use special attacks. Final Fantasy is an acquired taste, but try the first episode for free to see if you like it. The next two cost 99p each, and the final seven cost £3.99 apiece.The fourth in a series of super-tactile puzzle-box games, Old Sins bucks the law of diminishing returns: it’s the best yet. Exploring a ghostly doll’s house, you solve a physical puzzles by manipulating the objects you find there, sliding open secret compartments, rotating statues and ringing bells. Experimental tapping will only get you so far: real progress (and intense satisfaction) comes once you tune in to The Room’s twisty logic.Kitty Powers is the drag alter ego of games developer Richard Franke and the star of 2014’s Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker, which saw her (and you) matching cartoon clients for a dating agency. This sequel is about those successfully matched couples, who are now falling in love – and you are a God-like figure in charge of their town. Getting up and running takes a while, but you’ll soon be learning your villagers’ likes and dislikes and enthusiastically barging in on their romantic lives. It’s a nice twist on Sims-style, life-management genre.This turn-based strategy game sits somewhere between Hearthstone and Clash Royale, because you battle with fantasy character cards. There’s a well-designed solo mode to teach you how to fight and build a decent deck, ready for taking on other players online. There’s a lot of scope to sculpt a deck for your preferred battling style, using archer- and spell-heavy ranged attack tactics to up-close brawny brutes, but the intricacies don’t feel overwhelming.More fantasy deck building here, but Meteorfall is focused on solo play, with elements of dungeon adventuring woven in to its card battling. You choose a character, get a basic deck of attack cards, then swipe your way through fights with monsters, stopping off to expand and upgrade your deck and level-up your hero. Deaths are unavoidable, but you can save the gems earned by playing to unlock some new cards for the next time round. It’s a tight, cleverly focused card battler which will likely have you missing your train or bus stop, such is its one-more-go factor.“You control the level, not the character” isn’t an original twist, but in the right hands it can be inventive, as developer Alike Studio proves here. Your job is to guide alien hero Polo through a host of platform levels to find his kidnapped pet. Swipe vertical sections of the level up or down to swap in different obstacles and items before sending Polo through to see how he fares. It’s a cross between a game and a children’s mix-and-match book: pretty tough, but rarely frustrating. Already popular on consoles, Death Squared has you sliding two miniature robots through more than 80 levels, manipulating mechanisms and avoiding triggering traps to ensure both reach their end markers. You can play alone but Death Squared’s main appeal is as a co-op game for two players, each controlling a robot with gestures on one half of the screen. It’s less fiddly on an iPad, and one of the better family games of 2018, even though it wasn’t especially designed for children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef3bf3139cf9f41d2237cb76a61783a4aa22255/0_0_3555_2133/master/3555.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98d3e245fed5c8981dbf2bdb98c2549a","title":"older people disabilities poor health aid study","story":"The older you get, the less likely you are to get lifesaving help in a crisis, says report, and people with disabilities are worst affected Millions of older people with disabilities are at risk of missing out on crucial humanitarian assistance because of physical barriers or discrimination, research suggests.Up to 14 million older people with disabilities are affected by crises globally, according to a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and HelpAge International. It found that organisations often require people to collect aid or social protection payments in person, which is impossible for those who cannot travel long distances to get to distribution points. Older people with disabilities had also encountered hostile attitudes when trying to access support.The study was based on interviews with older people affected by crises in Tanzania and Ukraine, as well as a review of academic research. In Ukraine, some were made to feel humiliated by health and social security staff, while in Tanzania, interviewees reported that they had been accused by younger people of faking their disability in order to get money. Interviewees told researchers they felt forgotten about because of their age.The report warned that disabled older people faced a range of threats in crisis settings, including being less able to escape dangers posed by conflict or natural disasters. One interviewee, now living in Tanzania, told researchers that she had stayed in a hole for three days without any food or drinking water, to hide from conflict in Burundi.Older people with disabilities were also at a greater risk of poverty, more likely to be affected by barriers to healthcare, such as a shortage of medicines, and more likely to be living in inadequate housing conditions. Interviewees described having a lack of dignity, living in overcrowded homes with inaccessible toilets, and being socially isolated. Such challenges, on top of prolonged exposure to conflict and insecurity, all contributed towards worsening mental health.The report recommended greater use of home visits, the distribution of fuel or transport subsidies, and suggested that older people with disabilities should be given priority at food distribution sites. Age International is also calling for donors, policymakers and humanitarian responders to adopt the humanitarian inclusion standards for older people and people with disabilities, a set of principles developed by a group of charities and donors. “The UK’s Department for International Development has pledged to put disability at the heart of its work, and this research shows a clear and urgent need for more to be done to ensure that older people with disabilities get the support they desperately need and deserve in emergencies,” said Chris Roles, managing director of Age International. The research calls on donors, policymakers and aid agencies to support older people’s associations and disabled people’s organisations to work together, and improve aid workers’ understanding of the risks facing older people with disabilities.

Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e2577555a6130b19b567a9d3b3df5e302d55231/184_384_4996_2997/master/4996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbc526dc8be4c3c37ca2538c64bf9693","title":"disappearing jobs around the world in pictures","story":"Before May Day, AFP’s video and photo teams spoke to men and women around the globe whose jobs are becoming increasingly rare as technology transforms societies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/71_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb43c929806bbd6ffaa84c3d196cc961","title":"fresh lords defeat for government makes no deal less likely","story":"Cross-party amendment, passed with support of 19 Tory rebels, is seventh Lords defeat for government on EU withdrawal billThe government has suffered a heavy defeat on a crucial Lords vote that could pave the way for parliament to send ministers back to the Brussels negotiations if MPs vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Labour said the amendment, which is the seventh Lords defeat for the government on the EU withdrawal bill, would effectively prevent Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal. The cross-party amendment was supported by 19 Tory rebels, winning by a majority of 91.Ministers have previously warned that should parliament vote down the deal agreed by negotiators, Britain would leave the bloc with no agreement. The amendment, led by former Tory minister Douglas Hogg, would change that scenario, meaning parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks. The measure is designed to enhance Conservative MP Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, guaranteeing MPs a vote on the final deal, which won a shock victory in the Commons in December.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the vote “a hugely significant moment in the fight to ensure parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and that we avoid a no-deal situation”.The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the amendment “puts parliament in the driving seat”.Rebel Tory sources have said they hope to attract cross-party support in the Commons for the plan, giving remainers the confidence to vote against a damaging Brexit deal without the fear that it will trigger a “no deal” outcome where the consequences would be worse.During the debate, Hogg told peers the clause was “designed to ensure that the future of our country is determined by parliament and not by ministers”.He said a choice between accepting the terms or crashing out of the EU would not be a genuine choice. “This is not regaining control. To act in such a manner would be to impose ministerial decisions on parliament by coercion,” he said, calling it “an elective dictatorship of a particularly flagrant kind”.Echoing Margaret Thatcher, under whom he said he was “privileged to serve”, Hogg said his response was: “No, no no!”He called the referendum vote “at the very best an interim decision” and said the public could not have predicted the terms of the UK’s departure.Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts said he was deeply concerned about the sweeping powers of the government, likening it to the 1933 Enabling Act conferring absolute power on Adolf Hitler. “Perhaps I’m seeing threats that do not exist, but they are there, they are possible,” he said. Later in the debate, the Brexit-backing Green party peer Jenny Jones said she had come to the House of Lords prepared to vote for the amendment on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, but said she had been put off by the speeches of pro-remain peers.“Quite honestly, the speeches in favour have turned me against them,” she said. “There is clearly more of an agenda than control of the process.”Speaking after the vote, Lord Callanan, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the amendment would “weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely”.The government also lost a vote on a cross-party amendment led by Labour peer John Monks, which would give parliament even greater powers over the Brexit negotiations, though Lords sources played down the significance of the victory. Peers voted to back the amendment by 270 to 233.The amendment calls on ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase two negotiating mandate – similar to the process that exists at the EU level, where leaders of the EU27 approve the mandate of Michel Barnier’s negotiating team.Brexiters have said it fundamentally undermines the government. Writing for the Sun, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said: “Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical – because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.“Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give parliament the power to micromanage the government on how to carry out these negotiations.”Davis said the change would give the EU commission “a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb413fa9479d4d4a226af8ed512738d47e6043b/0_8_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b305bc0ba61b290e8dcf460ad0900fef","title":"hes a classic arch thatcherite readers on sajid javid as home secretary","story":"After Amber Rudd resigned following the publication of a deportation targets letter, you’ve been sharing your reaction Javid is a classic arch-Thatcherite his ethnicity doesn’t enter into it. He voted for every policy that created the current disaster that is the Home Office. He will do absolutely nothing to improve the situation.Javid’s appointment was the obvious no brainer appointment as home secretary. It also puts him a very strong position to take over from May should she be pushed under the wheels of a bus by furious Brexiteers or when she eventually steps down voluntarily. It also opens up a whole new possible Tory voter demographic against Labour under Corbyn should the above happen. There is no way a Brexiteer (I totally discount Gove, Johnson, Fox, Leadsom or Davis as serious contenders) could unite the Tory party in the event of May’s political demise and must also be a set back for Hunt and Williamson’s leadership ambitions.No surprises there then - Sajid Javid certainly fits the image the Tories want to portray while being a loyal ally. The noose still needs to tighten around the neck of May though, but we all know that senior Tories need her in place to take the crap for Brexit. What political intrigue we have.Had to be Javid, not much choice out of the ghastly MPs on offer. I don’t have any time for him myself, I don’t think he has been a very successful minister for housing and I think he is more a stop gap until the next reshuffle.Well, that was all a bit embarrassing wasn’t it. No minister in the past would have carried on in the way Rudd has done, but at last she has done the right thing unlike many of her peers in the current Tory party that continue to cling on. Where does this leave May? Exposed, that’s where. She was the architect of the hostility to immigrants policy, the buck stops with her. And then there’s Brexit. How can the government carry on pretending it has the authority, and the backing from the British people, to carry on imposing Brexit on us?After reading about Windrush, why should anyone in the EU27 trust the UK Home Office to protect the rights of EU27 citizens living in the UK post-Brexit? Mr Barnier should insist on a strong role for the European Court of Justice regarding those rights post-Brexit.Oh look, Theresa May has thrown another person under the bus. At a point, this tactic of blaming somebody else for her own blunders will fail because there will be no more people left to throw under the bus. This policy was as much her baby’s as Rudd’s. I hope Rudd’s resignation will not be the end of it.Do strong and stable governments typically see four cabinet ministers resign in disgrace within six months?This week could be brilliant. We’ve had a ministerial resignation, next up the palaver over the new minister, then a massive kicking for the Tories at the local elections. I suspect Boris will see this as his opportunity and will strike with all his snake-like guile and May will go. Then all we need is for Boris to be Boris and this government will come crashing down.Tomorrow is the beginning of May. And also the end of May, hopefully."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733a4fc8c186efff312134a678e2d191f8a8be03/0_142_2347_1408/master/2347.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ccdfe1b3d84d852c4d8ba6c4e692ba","title":"rudds resignation and british attitudes to immigration","story":"The Windrush affair continues to expose the fault lines in British society and immigration policy (Rudd quits over Windrush scandal, 30 April). The government has defended the hostile environment policy as primarily targeted at “illegal immigrants”. A person as opposed to an action, however, cannot be illegal. And it is unwise to use harsh, derogatory language about people.To promote constructive dialogue among more than 700 people from 50-plus countries at the first World Congress on Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health being held in Edinburgh (17-19 May), we have recommended using “irregular migrant”, defined as: “A person who, owing to unauthorized entry, breach of a condition of entry, failure to gain asylum, or the expiry of his or her visa, lacks legal authorisation to reside in the country where they find themselves.”Such a change would be a step towards rebuilding the tarnished reputation of this country in relation to immigration policy and race relations.Professor Raj BhopalChairperson, First World Congress of Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health• So another piece of political theatre comes to its denouement with Amber Rudd’s resignation. Conservative Home Office scandals are as predictable as pantomimes and come with their own time-honoured tropes including: cruel heartless and usually racist Tories and their selfless Labour opponents championing the\u0026nbspunderdog.Behind the scenes the reality is rather different. The underlying driver of the Home Office’s enduring difficulties is that the views of our political, media and judicial establishments on crime and immigration are fundamentally at odds with those of the majority of the British people. The public want firm but fair control of immigration.In the case of the Windrush scandal, we expect a speedy and fair resolution for people who have long integrated into British life, whether they are technically citizens or not.It is time that all elements of the establishment grasped that control of immigration – the issue that determined the result of the Brexit referendum – really matters to the British public.Otto InglisEdinburgh• The Windrush generation are not the only immigrants who have fallen short of the increased hostility of the UK government to migrants. After I married a Japanese national in 1992, we moved to the UK. Within 12 months, she was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Similarly, in 1995 we returned to Japan for my work and I was soon granted indefinite leave to remain. However, when we came back to the UK in 2010 (in order for me to establish what has become a flourishing biotechnology company) the UK government’s attitude to foreigners had hardened to the extent that, despite 25 years of marriage, my wife still does not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK and we have paid thousands in exploitative visa fees and undergone numerous stressful tests.A British citizen should have the right to live with their long-term foreign spouse in either of their countries of birth. However, the government would rather hit its arbitrary immigration and deportation targets than see decent people treated decently.Michael JonesCEO, Cell Guidance SystemsRoyston, Hertfordshire• The elation among Labour party activists who helped bring down Amber Rudd will be short lived. It\u0026nbspwas obvious when the liberal media and Tory neoliberal globalists worked lock-step to ensure her resignation that the entire Windrush scandal was a well set up ploy designed to get rid of a home secretary who actually wanted to fulfil the wishes of the British public and control our borders, particularly after Brexit.Labour politicians will celebrate for now but in short order will face again the question of what immigration policy they will present to the public. They will be forced to explain why so many of them want continued open borders. Hopefully it will also become clear that the unknown number of Windrush deportees, plus all those Caribbean people now worrying about their citizenship status, were simply pawns in a much bigger game.Philip DuvalManchester• There is a correlation between the appalling treatment the Windrush generation has suffered and the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (Dubs children) promised safety and sanctuary but denied it by the Home Office. In May 2016 parliament voted to amend the immigration bill to allow some of the “most vulnerable” children already in Europe to come to the UK. But the implementation was at fault because this government did not honour parliament or our obligation as fellow humans.Earlier this month, Rudd said she was “worried the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”. Too right. These are children fleeing war with no adult to look out for them. They have no voice against the hostility of the UK towards immigration, and they need our help.Annabelle ZinovieffFaringdon, Oxfordshire • Green gone. Amber gone. Is the government at the crossroads?

Or rather, struck one familiar pose – the rather curious, legs-too-far-apart “power stance”.It has become a habit from leading Conservative politicians, dating back to 2015. George Osborne was the early adopter, photographed here after delivering his speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester that year.The spread soon spread. Future prime minister Theresa May took her turn following her speech at the same conference. And then Michael Gove was spotted by  writer Michael Deacon, appearing backstage interviewed by the BBC, in the very same pose.A few months later, then prime minister David Cameron was also doing it – on live TV – for his doomed TV debate attempts to get the country to vote remain in the 2016 referendum.But where does it come from?Back in 2015 the  asked Dr Connson Locke, a leadership and organisational behaviour lecturer at LSE. After she stopped laughing at Osborne’s picture, she told Homa Khaleeli: “All I can think is that he got the advice that you should take up space to demonstrate confidence and he’s taken that to a weird extreme … It doesn’t mean standing with your feet so out of place that you look unnatural.”One possible source is Amy Cuddy. She did a very popular TEDTalk in 2012 that suggested that people adopting “high-power poses” for a couple of minutes a day lead to a measurable difference in how confidently they felt and acted. One of the poses she claimed had this effect is a Lynda Carter Wonder Woman-style pose, very similar to the one that the Tories keep making.Others suggested the influence might be from a beloved TV programme closer to home.With the political demise of Cameron and Osborne in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, and May’s determination to put the remain-backing Conservative years behind the party, we thought the Tory power stance had disappeared.Could Javid’s resurrection of the pose be a coded message to backbench remainers?Meanwhile, with the news breaking late on Sunday night that Amber Rudd had resigned following the Windrush revelations, Labour MP David Lammy had a very different power stance in mind on his way to work on Monday morning.A vocal critic of both the prime minister and the ousted home secretary, Lammy used Twitter to suggest he’d entered the Houses of Parliament today with more than a little swagger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d16e1ba6b834ecadc07c18f4941923c889869af/0_89_3449_2069/master/3449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934733a6ee3fa133f0095074a9514184","title":"tories flounder in attempt to launch operation save theresa","story":"Amber Rudd made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her bossWith Operation Save Amber finally derailed after two weeks of fire-fighting the former home secretary’s failing memory – by the weekend she couldn’t even remember what targets she was meant to have forgotten – the Tory party’s attention turned to Operation Save Face. Aka Operation Save Theresa. With Amber Rudd out of a job, the prime minister has been left with no one else to take the blame for her hostile environment policy that caused the Windrush scandal.First out of the blocks on Radio 4’s Today programme was the former cabinet minister Damian Green, a zen master of never saying anything interesting. It took a while for Green to even admit that Rudd had been forced to resign and even then he restricted himself to a laconic: “She had to go.” Which made one wonder why he and so many other Conservatives had spent the previous week saying she had to stay.Next on the airwaves was Chris Grayling, which showed how much of a panic the government was in. The transport secretary is just about the only minister who makes David Davis look quick-witted and is the last person who should be sent out in a crisis.Sure enough, Grayling self-destructed in 10 seconds. After demonstrating he had no grasp of the situation by insisting a fourth cabinet resignation within six months was merely “unwanted noise”, he went on to say that May wouldn’t have known about the targets letter Rudd had sent her in 2017. After all, if the home secretary couldn’t remember writing the letter, then why on earth should the prime minister be expected to recall having read it? Over in Downing Street, May let out a shriek as Grayling inadvertently tried to get her the sack as well. The transport secretary pressed on. What it came down to was this: no one was really to blame for the Windrush debacle and Rudd was every bit as much a victim as the many thousands who had found themselves deprived of work and healthcare and threatened with deportation.More so, in fact. It had been a real advantage to have someone in charge of the Home Office who didn’t know what she was doing and it was a tragedy that she had resigned. Rudd’s tragedy was that she was just too good for this world. She had just made one teeny-weeny little mistake. The mistake of trying to protect her boss.Shortly after appointing Sajid Javid as her new home secretary, it was May’s turn to face the cameras. She looked and sounded terrible, as if she was featuring in a hostage video. Yes there had been targets when she had been home secretary, she mumbled, her eyes numb with terror. It was near enough a confession that she knew Rudd had misled parliament but hadn’t thought it important enough to mention to anyone. Amber could be very proud of her time as home secretary, she added. It’s not everyone who gets to preside over one of the department’s biggest failures in its history.Having posed with his legs thrust astride outside his new office – the department had needed a bit of manspreading to shake it up – Javid soon found himself inside the Commons to face his first urgent question as home secretary. Understandably, he chose to keep his opening remarks short and sweet. He was Windrush. Kiss the badge. Nobody cared about Windrush more than him and he would do whatever was necessary to put things right.Labour’s Diane Abbott wasn’t convinced. She had heard much the same from the last home secretary and what was required was actions not words. Would he reverse the 2014 immigration act and commit to making sure that no other Commonwealth citizens were treated in the same way?“She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger,” Javid snapped indignantly, before going on to show that he still hadn’t fully understood the nature of the problem by failing to acknowledge it had been the prime minister’s hostile environment policies that had resulted in British citizens being threatened with deportation.Several Labour MPs tried to put him right, but Javid wasn’t having any of it. He refused to recognise the term hostile environment. “It’s a compliant environment,” he protested. Compliant as in being as beastly as possible to anyone who looked foreign without being actively hostile. Words matter.Tory Nick Boles invited the new home secretary to distance himself from legacy policies that were fundamentally wrong. Sajid declined. He’d only just got the promotion and was not about to do anything that might get him sacked on the first day. He knew where his priorities lay. His job was to appear to be different. Not be different.

Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eabc48a25897572716803b7e780d29c6c251a43/0_89_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52c1bfac09480f9dee88157d20ea5108","title":"woman with aspergers ejected from cinema for laughing at western","story":"Tamsin Parker, 25, was removed for laughing during The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in LondonThe British Film Institute has apologised after staff forcibly removed a woman with Asperger syndrome from the cinema in what onlookers described as a “disgusting” sign of “naked intolerance”.Tamsin Parker, 25, an artist and animator, was watching a screening at the BFI’s cinema on London’s South Bank of her favourite film – the spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, directed by Sergio Leone – with two friends. She was asked to leave for laughing too loudly.Her mother added: “She was completely humiliated and it ruined her birthday.”The BFI released a statement saying it was sorry and had got it wrong in a “challenging and complex situation”.“We are taking this situation extremely seriously and this morning we have been investigating further ... We can and must do better in accommodating all the needs of our customers and we will be addressing what additional provisions and staff training we can put in place,” the institute said.Parker’s mother, who is speaking to a lawyer about what happened, said: “It would be nice to arrange a screening for Tamsin and her friends. The manager did not seem very apologetic at the time.” Parker was eager to see the BFI screening and has watched the film eight times, according to her mother, who went to collect her daughter after she was thrown out. “She was in floods of tears ... she was really scared,” her mother said.Lydia Parker, a theatre director, said it had been heartening to see messages of support on Twitter. The story has been shared widely on social media, with people voicing concern.One cinemagoer, Lloyd Shepherd, expressed his disgust after the incident. “She’d been laughing very loudly, but at moments which were supposed to be funny. Some people complained. She was dragged out shouting: ‘I’m sorry, I have Asperger’s.’ She was incredibly upset,” he said.He said some people applauded her removal while others were upset, with a large number leaving.“I am shaking with anger. That poor, poor woman. Just a little bit of empathy and everything would have been fine. Such naked intolerance. In the middle of London.

It’s her favourite movie and it was her 25th birthday celebration.”The National Autistic Society said many autistic people felt venues were not autism-friendly enough, which is why it runs the autism friendly award to encourage businesses to be more accessible. The charity added that it works with cinemas and theatres to hold autism-friendly screenings.Jane Harris, the NAS’s director of external affairs, said the incident was shocking and a colleague was at the screening, “along with others who were equally distressed by what they had witnessed”.“It’s great to hear that so many audience members were sympathetic, but this incident shows just how far we have to go for autistic people to get the understanding they deserve,” she added.Harris said the NAS would be reaching out to the BFI to discuss ways to improve its staff members’ understanding of autism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3212429511c0d322731047eaeed54e2589471c/0_445_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce46de4b47eb1855c5723d4ba9b8fb04","title":"philippa york macho culture cyclists coming out","story":"Philippa York has suggested the macho culture in professional cycling is preventing riders from coming out as gay.York was King of the Mountains on the 1984 Tour de France while competing as Robert Millar and later disappeared from public life before transitioning to become a woman.It is 30 years since York struggled with gender dysphoria while still competing but she believes there is still an absence of a support system to allow an active rider to be openly homosexual. York was speaking before the Giro d’Italia which begins in Jerusalem on Friday, the first time the Grande Partenza – or start of the race – has been held outside Europe. There will be 175 riders competing for 22 teams and hundreds more backroom staff but York said her information was that none of them is openly gay.“There’s certainly no back up in any of the teams which would allow you to show any kind of gayness, anywhere on that gay spectrum,” she said.“It’s that whole macho culture of everybody’s straight white male and that’s it. The crazy thing is that the cycling model is set up by sponsorships, and those big sponsors, they’re usually big companies, they have a whole system of dealing with what I call the gay spectrum and they have no issue with it at all.“You can’t show any kind of weakness because, being gay, anywhere on that gay spectrum is seen as a weakness. In the macho world you can’t show that, because you’ll get more abuse from the side of the road than you get already.”York believes it will take at least a generation for the culture to change.“That is going to change when the young riders who are coming through school nowadays who get taught differently,” she said.The massive logistical operation of the Giro d’Italia was already under way on Monday with a Boeing 747 aircraft transporting the equipment, including several hundred bikes, to Israel. The race begins with a 9.7km time trial in Jerusalem on Friday.There will be two more stages in the country before the plane is loaded up again and flown the 2,000km to Sicily next Sunday when the Giro d’Italia transfers from Israel to Catania for the remainder of the race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63dc81e5db76a184d70731d18dd572184a08dc46/0_47_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236e23e0b4a9f31a6745de7643a297ef","title":"david haye has one last chance to win back fans against tony bellew","story":"David Haye was once the most exciting heavyweight in the world. He was fast, powerful and smart in the ring, punching considerably above his weight, loud and controversial outside it, a charismatic magnet of controversy.Yet for all that he has achieved – world titles at cruiser and heavyweight and as much celebrity and money as any good-looking working-class south London boy could have asked for – there is little doubt that, at 37, he has fallen short of what he could have achieved in an era of flux.When the Hayemaker finally goaded his way into a showdown with Wladimir Klitschko in 2011, pulling off a masterpiece of aggressive marketing, he stubbed his toe. A string of injuries banjaxed two fights against Tyson Fury. His achilles gave up on him in the ring against Tony Bellew just over a year ago and he fell down some stairs on the eve of their scheduled rematch just before Christmas.Now he gets one more chance. He has stretched the patience of paying customers and opponents to the limit. At the 02 Arena in London on Saturday night – a few miles from where he grew up – Haye and Bellew go at it again.The Liverpudlian, a couple of years younger, will start a slight favourite, and that will suit Haye, who enjoys the added incentive of proving everyone wrong. He promises: “I’ve got something up my sleeve for Bellew.”He has been uncharacteristically quiet in the build-up this time, almost Zen-like in soaking up Bellew’s barbs. It is as if he is trying to con him into a sense of complacency. That probably will not happen, because he has annoyed Bellew to distraction in the past.Bellew (who has already starred in his own movie) is winning the battle for the gallery. On Twitter at the weekend he summed up the fighter’s code: “This time next week I’ll be punching someone in the face and be getting punched right back in the face! I’m actually excited at the thought of this! suppose what ever floats ya boat eh.” In that, at least, they have something in common. Haye loves a tear-up.Nevertheless, a trawl of social media reveals a lot of fans are sick and tired of Haye. Most of them have forgotten the good nights, the performances that thrilled, the crashing overhand rights that rendered opponents senseless and bewildered.Probably Haye’s last impressive display was stopping Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in five rounds. That was nearly six years ago. He said in his pomp he would retire on his 31st birthday. If fighters share a vice it is staying too long at the party. On Saturday night we’ll see if Haye has anything left to celebrate or is prepared finally to wander into the night.The dance has begun. But the tango boxing wants more than any other, the one that makes most sense and most cents – Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder – remains mired in online noise and baby-level exchanges across the ditch.The latest wheeze is that the American heavyweight who cannot fill a 19,000-seater in Brooklyn has gone straight to his British cash cow, bypassing Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, and put $50m on the table.Joshua – whose last three title defences have drawn more than a quarter of a million punters to Wembley and Cardiff – turns to Hearn, lifts an eyebrow, and the Matchroom boss says: “Leave it AJ, they’re not serious.”So the contest is still in round one: much positioning, the odd jab, nobody risking a big shot. It is like David Haye v Audley Harrison on a never-ending loop. Hearn is in New York pushing his middleweight Daniel Jacobs but reported that Wilder’s people failed to show for scheduled talks.Hearn, of course, is loving his name for one of Wilder’s representatives, Shelly Finkel: Shirley Winkle. Lou Di Bella, another of the American’s financial advisers, lashes out from his cot that this is just plain dumb. Meanwhile there is snarling in the cheap seats. Fans want some action.They are sucked into the ritual, believing nothing and everything, so long as the day of the big collision is drawn closer. They will complain that they cannot stand Hearn, or think that Wilder is dodging Joshua, or that no way can Deontay come up with the bucks he is said to have dangled in front of his rival.The only way to cope with the anxiety of such nonsense is to let it run out of steam. Sooner or later Hearn, perhaps with a nudge from his father, will corner the Americans in a hotel room somewhere and thrash out a deal that will make all of them millions they cannot afford to ignore.The problem is not the fighters. They want to get it on. And, understandably, they want to maximise their earnings. But their promoters, managers and lawyers, meanwhile, do not want any spare change leaking to the other side. And that, without exception, is always the story behind the story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef0acab79cc76eea6572628cb9021f39d09892e/13_146_5157_3094/master/5157.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d546719485da5360801e1d2f64f32f6f","title":"lewis hamilton mercedes ferrari sebastian vettel red bull f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton was absolutely honest after his unlikely victory in Baku. He knew he had inherited a win that with three laps to go was looking like a third place and a further deficit to Sebastian Vettel in the world championship. He came out of it on top and rightly did not opt to celebrate as he might have were it a harder won victory. He is four points ahead of Vettel but made it clear that relying on good fortune would not be enough in what is shaping up to be a highly contested season. The reality, Hamilton knows, is that with the exception of Melbourne, Mercedes have been unable to match Ferrari. The issue of unlocking performance from the car by working the tyres at the correct temperature is key and as things stand Ferrari do not face the same problem. How Mercedes fare at the next round in Barcelona, in a European climate similar to that we are likely to see at many summer meetings, will be telling. If they struggle at the Circuit de Catalunya it may be that far from last year’s a, this year they have created a monster.The stewards found both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen at fault for the accident that caused the crucial safety car in Azerbaijan. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, in public at least, said he held both drivers responsible and that both would be required to go to the factory in Milton Keynes and apologise to the workforce. Red Bull’s motorsport adviser Helmut Marko also blamed them both. “We let the drivers race and then they are doing that. Unbelievable. Both were wrong,” he said. Verstappen’s ill-advised moves against Hamilton and Vettel already this season have put him under more scrutiny than most but it is hard to ignore that moving as he did in Baku is always increasing the likelihood of contact. Red Bull do let their drivers race and until that moment it had been hugely entertaining. They insist they will continue to do so. It has proved costly but absolutely gripping for the sport. Let’s hope they stick to it.Azerbaijan is becoming a race of some import for the Monégasque rookie Charles Leclerc. Last year in Baku on his way to the F2 title, he won here just three days after the death of his father. An emotional weekend in which he wanted to deliver in his father’s honour. He repeated the feat this weekend. His sixth place in the Sauber was a magnificent drive and absolute confirmation of the exceptional promise he has previously displayed. The 20-year-old’s opening race weekends have been patchy at best as he comes to terms with an F1 car and his team do the same with a design that is completely new, conceptually brave and still in the process of being understood. However, on Sunday Leclerc looked absolutely in the groove, controlled, fluent and unafraid to attack. He described his first F1 points-scoring result as feeling like a win and with a few more performances like this Ferrari may consider promoting him to the Scuderia sooner rather than later.Vettel was insistent that he “had to try” his attempt to pass Bottas on the restart and from a psychological perspective, it is likely a claim as much to reassure himself as anyone else. But the move, which ultimately cost him an almost certain second place and potentially a win, could have been given greater consideration. There were three laps to go at that point, time still to close on Bottas and plan the overtake. Moreover, out of the pressure cooker of the restart he would likely have been able to take a calmer approach to it. Certainly Hamilton was harrying him on the restart but he could have gone defensive. Instead he committed to the attempt, did so clumsily and failed to pull it off. There were shades of the costly start in Singapore here, the bigger picture lost in a moment. Last season those moments were ultimately crucial in the championship he cannot afford to repeat them.Sergio Pérez’s third place was the culmination of a quite superb race. He had been hit by the Williams of Sergey Sirotkin on lap one, which pushed him into Kimi Räikkönen, breaking his front wing and requiring an immediate pit stop. He then took a five-second penalty at his second stop for a safety car line infringement. Yet he came back with remarkable resolve. Finally finding himself behind Vettel when the German flat-spotted his tyre on the final restart, Pérez spotted his chance and went for it, taking fourth. But he then had to hold the place – a huge task as Vettel came back at him. He did so brilliantly. “I had to give it everything in the last two laps,” he said. “My pace was unbelievable and I think they were the best two laps of my life.” His eighth podium is a new Mexican record, one more than Pedro Rodríguez scored with second place at the 1971 Dutch GP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a467a4da07dbc879f821b576b274e00f26122b1a/0_375_4093_2455/master/4093.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dccc8a0ec049777236edd19ce771e11","title":"frankie vah luke wright soho theatre london atiha sen gupta","story":"Delivered entirely in verse, Wright’s coming-of-age tale Frankie Vah is set in Thatcher’s Britain but the debate is as relevant as everWhat happens if you love your parents but loathe their politics? In Frankie Vah, the second verse play written and performed by Luke Wright, Frankie struggles to reconcile his father’s “Christian empathy” as a vicar with the fact that he puts a cross next to Margaret Thatcher’s name at the ballot box. Frankie abandons the vicarage for a life on the road as a radical left punk poet. The dog collar is traded in for a pair of DMs.Before the show begins, a spool of TV footage from the 1980s unfurls on the wall: flitting images of Spitting Image, Neil Kinnock falling into the sea and a post-Falklands Thatcher triumphant atop a tank. Frankie Vah is born Simon Mortimer in the life-sapping Dedham Vale (the part of Essex that John Constable used to paint). With his teenage years spent watching water mills, altar screens and ponds, our hero longs for university. There, he discovers himself both politically and poetically after chancing upon a gig by the Ranting Poets, “forged from punk and now at war in Thatcher’s Britain”. Deciding to become a performance poet, Mortimer metamorphoses into Frankie Vah less pen name, more nom-de-guerre. He finds love with fellow ally and artist Eve, flings his father’s faith back in his face, escapes to a “scabby flat” in London and joins a Red Wedge-inspired indie band on tour as a support act during the 1987 general election. Wright is a clever playwright and a charismatic performer he conjures minor characters to life with wit and verve in particular the boastful lisping Liverpudlian tour manager Petey. Delivered entirely in verse, Frankie flies between filling us in on where he’s at in life to performing his poems to the “paying” public we are cast as both his confidants and his audience. This creates an interesting tension particularly towards the end when his growing fame and self-destructive behaviour begin to unravel the persona he’s created for us. Throughout the piece, Frankie highlights how the left have to fight on two fronts – against not only Thatcher’s Tories but also against the centre of their own party. Debates rage on stage about the best way for Labour to gain the keys to Number 10 – how much principle should be lost for how much power gained? Times may have changed, but it seems the fundamental questions are eternal. Some argue that there’s no place for the political in plays – and I know of several playwrights who would reject that label – but drama and politics have much in common. They’re both fundamentally about a disruption to the status quo. Whereas most coming-of-age stories on the stage tend to focus solely on the personal, Frankie Vah is all the richer for its political and poetical layers. If the purpose of poetry is to make us bilingual in our own language, Wright succeeds in finding new and beautiful ways of expressing the everyday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bfa27efad28d741ff94c9124800edfe5decb204/589_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c6c91812e9a67782fce923bee7edeeb","title":"windows 10 april 2018 update microsoft task management cortana edge sharing","story":"Microsoft has released the latest version of Windows 10, adding improvements to task management, Cortana, Edge and sharingThe next version of Windows 10 is finally ready to download as a free update that adds some potentially game-changing new features as well as some welcome features that bring it up to par with what you might expect from a smartphone.Instead of adding tools for people creating media, as the previous two updates have, the latest version of Windows 10 is focused on time and task management.“We want to give you back some of your greatest currency, your time. Our hope is that you’ll have more time to do what matters most to you – create, play, work or simply do what you love,” said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group.That’s what was reported earlier in the year, but Microsoft has made the wise choice to simplify the name this time round. Instead of trying to work out which year the Fall or Spring might be in, now we’ve got month and year, which makes a lot more sense.It’s true. The update has only just squeaked in at the last minute to make it into April. It was scheduled to be released a couple of weeks ago, but a bug found at the last minute by testers had to be fixed before it was released beyond the early adopter “Windows Insider” community.Most people will probably get the update after April as it gradually rolls out.The easiest way is to wait for the notification from Windows Update, which lets the user know a feature update is ready to install, but you can also manually check for updates from the Settings app. Failing that you can manually download the latest version of Windows 10 direct from Microsoft and upgrade from that.In a word, yes. While there are ways to stop Windows 10 from downloading it, Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows 10 for two years or less from release.That means that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released in August 2016 is no longer supported and will not receive further bug fixes and security updates. The Creators Update, released in April 2017 will no longer be supported from 9 October this year, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows 10 is to keep upgrading.The biggest and most obvious change is the addition of a timeline feature to the task view. Essentially a history of the apps and files you had open earlier that day or week, Timeline allows you to see what you were doing on the PC you’re currently using and other devices, and resume from where you left off.As Microsoft’s apps on other platforms gain Timeline support their activities will show up on your PC. One of the first is Microsoft Edge for Android and iOS.Focus Assist is a beefed-up version of Do Not Disturb. You can turn it on manually or set it up on a schedule, and it’ll block notifications and other distractions until you’re done. At the end it’ll provide a summary of what happened while you were doing whatever it was you were doing.Like a DND mode you can whitelist certain people so that their emails and messages get through, even when you’re trying to concentrate.Microsoft is pushing improved dictation as a feature of the April 2018 update. In any text box you can now hit the Windows Key + H and start talking.Microsoft’s virtual assistant gets some new powers with the April 2018 update. It will now suggest tasks you might want to resume from previous devices, tapping into the Timeline feature. Support for some smart home appliances has also been rolled out, including Google’s Nest thermostat, and natural language voice control for third-party apps such as Spotify is also being added.Still seeking to convince people to use it over Chrome, Microsoft’s Edge browser gains the ability to strip out clutter when you print from a website, and the ability to mute audio from specific tabs. Some new Grammar Tools will also help break down complex words into syllables and highlight nouns, verbs and adjectives. That adds to several other ebook, design and gesture support improvements.Microsoft has implemented its own version of Apple’s AirDrop, sending files over Bluetooth and wifi without having to mess about with cables. You can limit it to just your devices or any Windows 10 device. How useful the feature turns out to be depends on how many Windows 10 devices you have around you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568e7dc1d1f66c2ffc6dc97eaac1da6373bda7b6/0_0_6314_3788/master/6314.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ceede9edce61b13b110046a9e5c9a04","title":"art on the bbc the genius of leonardo da vinci","story":"Kenneth (Civilisation) Clark, Henry Moore and other ghosts from the BBC Archives bring us a bargain-basement portrait of the renaissance manJanina Ramirez, the art historian, is walking purposefully towards me, along a corridor. It has become a television bugbear for me, the “approach” approach to presenting, walk and talk. Like the – worse still – camera whirling around the head thing, AKA helicoptering. I mind less if the walk is connected to what they are saying, if they are pointing things out as they go. But Ramirez is talking about the Mona Lisa and she is not in the Louvre, she is in Blenheim Palace. It is walking for the sake of walking and I find it a little unsettling. Ramirez is great and has lots of interesting things to say. She makes me want to sit and listen, not feel as if I am walking backwards and\u0026nbspworrying about tripping over.While I am moaning, here is another little one that is specific to art on TV and also on show here: the slow pan over a work. You don’t look at a picture in a gallery like that, do you, unless you are drunk? You look at the whole thing, then you might focus on areas or details. And that is fine, if the camera zooms in for the expert to point something out or explain something. But the slow\u0026nbsppan is meaningless.Both of the above, I think, are about television’s fear of stillness. Everything has to keep moving or, they seem to think, people will get bored. There is a similar fear about a different kind of stillness – a lack of noise – which is why silence must be filled with music. But stillness – both kinds – can be powerful and make you sit\u0026nbspup and listen.Moan over. Ramirez is talking about Leonardo, his insatiable curiosity, his quest for knowledge and his use of light and shade. There is time spent on his technical innovation and his revolutionary anatomical research. In short: his genius. “Genius, genius, genius …” echo a chorus of critics and art historians and presenters from the ghost of television past. Ramirez’s journey takes her not just along the corridors of Blenheim, but also deep into the BBC archive, to see how television has influenced our understanding of the man and his work.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspkind of TV history of L da V.So here is Kenneth Clark in the seminal series Civilisation talking about that curiosity, and timelessness (see, Clark’s not walking, but sitting, and I am listening). And Robert Hughes bringing some antipodean early-70s cool, and excellent hair, to the table.And, most tantalisingly, Henry Moore from a 1978 Arena programme – caressing what seems to be the leg bone of a large animal, but may be one of his own creations – talking about Leonardo’s unending childlike quest for knowledge and his desire to share what he felt\u0026nbspabout life through his work. I would like to have seen more of that one, artist on artist that is the problem with this hooked-on-snippets approach.Here is reconstructed Leonardo (did Mark Rylance really need to do flickery candlelit recon?) in 2003. And Fiona Bruce on the search for lost works. And Andrew Graham-Dixon being taken under the skin of the Mona Lisa by a man named Pascal and his magic wavelength machine, to find another woman ...The best things in this show have all been on other programmes, but that is the nature of it. And Ramirez turns it into something coherent and interesting that says something about the man himself, his timelessness, and about his TV career. To be honest I am surprised he didn’t pre-invent the television. I bet there is a sketch of something that looks very like one\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsplost notebook somewhere Bruce should get on the hunt.Another good thing about Ramirez: she is a she. Whereas everyone else, in all the past BBC art programmes, has either been a he\u0026nbspor Fiona Bruce. That is\u0026nbspprogress.Speaking of progress, she doesn’t do the walking thing too much. Why Blenheim, though? Is there a little-known Leonardo hanging in Oxfordshire? No, but there is\u0026nbspa James Thornhill ceiling, painted as the Renaissance in Europe was drawing to a close. That is a bit tenuous, isn’t it?I am wondering if, as my own painstaking research has\u0026nbspdiscovered, it might have something to do with the fact that Woodstock, the town outside Blenheim’s gates, is also Ramirez’s hometown? No travel, flights to\u0026nbspFlorence or Eurostar to Paris, even bus tickets required. Just a short – purposeful – walk. Coupled with\u0026nbspthe use of the corporation’s own archive, this must\u0026nbsphave been pretty cheap TV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8184cb1d1af8ab322c3ccc74f27e198528af8c/0_215_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3650c509a435673372cea6ea993a7d75","title":"sidelined china seeks to maintain influence as ties between north korea and us improve","story":"Improved relations between the former foes could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outsideDuring North and South Korea’s historic summit on Friday, China was notably quiet. Chinese officials and state media focused instead on president Xi Jinping’s meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and a visit by Xi to China’s Yangtze river. After the summit, China’s ministry of foreign affairs released a short statement saying Beijing “welcomed” the results of the talks. “China stands ready to continue to play its positive role to this end,” it added, according to Xinhua news agency. Then, on Monday, China’s foreign ministry announced it was sending its top diplomat, foreign minister Wang Yi, to visit North Korea this week.The visit comes as China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, moves to reassert itself in quickly moving peace talks with the formerly isolated Korean state. China has long said that North Korea’s nuclear programme is for Washington and Pyongyang to work out between themselves. But now warming ties between North Korea and the US could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outside.Kim said on Friday he is willing to give up nuclear weapons if the US promises not to invade and commits to a formal end to the Korean War that ended with an armistice in 1953. Kim and US president Donald Trump could meet within the next month.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“So now things are out of China’s control and it is no surprise that it is being excluded from the discussions.”While talks between North and South Korea and Washington fit China’s interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing is also worried about an unfavourable regional strategic balance unfolding.China will still be part of any discussions over a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice signed by China, the US and North Korea in 1953, ending more than three years of fighting between the North and the South. A trilateral summit in May between Japan, South Korea, and China will also provide Beijing another chance to exert influence, according to Kovrig. “Politically, I think China is being careful to give North and South Korea the space to advance the diplomatic process, because that’s in Beijing’s interest. Watching closely and working behind the scenes to position itself,” said Kovrig."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479592.1525120677!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mid life anxiety could lead to dementia researchers find","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced in the years preceding a dementia diagnosis and have been associated with cognitive impairment,” write researchers from the University of Southampton and University College London. Illustration: iStockPeople who suffer from moderate to severe anxiety during middle age could be more likely to develop dementia in later life, researchers in the UK have found.An in-depth study of research into anxiety diagnosis has found that mid-life mental illnesses may be associated with dementia, with a gap of at least 10 years between the diagnoses.However, researchers could not determine whether active treatment, including non-drug therapies such as mindfulness and meditation, could curb the risk of developing the disease.The researchers trawled studies looking at the association between mid-life anxiety, in isolation or combined with depression, and the development of dementia. Only four out of more than 3,500 studies met these criteria, but they involved a total of nearly 30,000 people.Dementia is a term used to describe a number of conditions that cause damage to brain cells. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common and well-known cause of dementia and occurs when a build-up of protein on the brain forms plaques and tangles that stop the brain from working as it should. Vascular dementia is another common form of dementia and occurs when the blood supply to the brain is damaged.The study, which was published by the BMJ Open online medical journal on Monday night, follows recent evidence which revealed a link between anxiety and mild cognitive impairment, and is also connected to the known association between depression and dementia.Researchers note that abnormal levels of stress can speed up brain cell ageing and degenerative changes in the central nervous system and thus make people more vulnerable to developing dementia later in life.“Anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced in the years preceding a dementia diagnosis and have been associated with cognitive impairment,” write researchers from the University of Southampton and University College London. Whether reducing anxiety in middle age would result in a reduced risk of dementia “remains an open question”, they write.The study recommends that GPs consider anxiety as well as depression as an indicator of risk for dementia and that “close monitoring of subtle cognitive decline in older adults with a history of anxiety, depression and cerebrovascular disease (conditions that affect blood supply to the brain) would be encouraged”.Research into the benefits of treating anxiety without the use of drugs should also be investigated, notes the study. “Non-pharmacological therapies, including talking therapies and mindfulness-based interventions and meditation practices, that are known to reduce anxiety in midlife, could have a risk-reducing effect, although this is yet to be thoroughly researched.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Living within 500 metres of a pig lessens the likelihood of an allergy, according to researchersVegetarians tend to go through the menopause earlier than meat eaters, study findsAbnormal levels of stress in middle-age can speed up brain cell ageing, says studyCourt criticises HSE for permitting doctors work as consultants without being on specialist registerHealth service chief apologises for \u0026lsquocompletely unacceptable\u0026rsquo practicesCurrent reporting model needs to be reformed due to errors, Minister saysTony O\u0026rsquoBrien says he had no knowledge of Vicky Phelan case until he read about it in mediaTax will see price of some sugar-sweetened drinks rise 60c for a two-litre bottleGroup says move is \u0026lsquomost important\u0026rsquo step yet in fight against childhood obesityFr Gerard Desmond hit with revolver butt and shot in legs during robbery in LimaEU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator responds to DUP leader by saying there is \u0026lsquono spirit of revenge\u0026rsquoLimerick woman\u0026rsquos comments come after revelation that 17 affected women have diedJohn and Tammy Stokes are currently living in a cabin on a halting site in ClondalkinEU chief Brexit negotiator eschews \u0026lsquoany kind of polemics\u0026rsquo with DUP leaderAurelijus Kizelavicius (22) punched his victim up to six times in face before raping her87-year-old Michael Culligan banned from driving for six years after crashTheresa Cullen told court she lived behind drawn blinds in her home for two yearsAuthorities seek information about deaths of Cathal O\u0026rsquoBrien and Kevin Ball 24 years ago"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479383.1525117139!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier told ni businesses have no interest in borders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn a visit to Newry, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he was aware of the challenges Brexit poses for manufacturing and agriculture in Northern Ireland.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479503.1525113370!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords inflicts brexit defeat on may s government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Peers voted by 335 votes to 244 in favour of an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill despite government warnings that the vote would put Britain at a disadvantage in negotiations with the EU. File photograph: PA WireTheresa May’s government has suffered a major defeat on Brexit in the House of Lords, which voted to allow parliament to reject a withdrawal agreement without triggering an exit from the European Union with no deal. Peers voted by 335 votes to 244 in favour of an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill despite government warnings that the vote would put Britain at a disadvantage in negotiations with the EU.“We are disappointed that the House of Lords has voted for this amendment in spite of the assurances we have provided,” Minister of state at the Brexit department Martin Callanan said after the vote.“What this amendment would do is weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.”The amendment, which will be considered by MPs when the Bill returns to the House of Commons, says the government can only conclude a withdrawal agreement if it has been approved in draft form by both houses of parliament. Such a vote should take place before the agreement is debated in the European Parliament, which must ratify any Brexit deal.Crucially, it gives parliament the authority to determine the government’s negotiating mandate, declaring that the government “must follow any direction in relation to the negotiations under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union which has been approved by a resolution of the House of Commons, and subject to the consideration of a motion in the House of Lords”.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer described the Lords’ vote as “a hugely significant moment” in the fight for parliament’s role in the Brexit negotiations and in avoiding a no-deal exit.“Labour won the argument at the end of last year for parliament to be given a meaningful vote on the terms of our withdrawal from the EU. And we are clear that it must be just that: a meaningful vote. If parliament votes down the article 50 deal, then parliament must decide what happens next. Under no circumstances can the prime minister be given a blank cheque to crash the UK out of the EU without a deal. I would urge the prime minister to accept this cross-party amendment and recognise that there is no majority in parliament or the country for a no-deal Brexit,” he said.Twelve Conservative MPs joined Labour, the Scottish National Party and other opposition parties last December to defy the government by giving parliament a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal. The government has promised to give MPs a vote but has insisted until now that a vote to reject the withdrawal agreement would lead to Britain leaving the EU with no deal at all.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

I\u0027m not happy. I want to die. It\u0027s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.My feeling is that an old person like myself should have full citizenship rights including the right of assisted suicide, he added.Prof Goodall made headlines in 2016 when his university tried to force him from his role on the grounds that, at the age of 102, he was no longer fit to be on campus.Prof Goodall with Carol O\u0026#39Neill of Exit International, which advocates for voluntary euthanasiaAssisted suicide is illegal in most countries around the world and was banned in Australia until the state of Victoria became the first to legalise the practice last year.But that legislation, which takes effect from June 2019, only applies to terminally ill patients of sound mind and a life expectancy of less than six months.Other states in Australia have debated euthanasia in the past, but the proposals have always been defeated, mostly recently in New South Wales state last year.Exit International, which is helping Mr Goodall make the trip, said it was unjust that one of Australia\u0027s oldest and most prominent citizens should be forced to travel to the other side of the world to die with dignity.A peaceful, dignified death is the entitlement of all who want it. And a person should not be forced to leave home to achieve it, it said on its website Monday.The group has launched a GoFundMe campaign to get plane tickets for Goodall and his helper upgraded to business class from economy and has so far raised more than Aus$17,000 (£9,000).Prof Goodall, an honorary research associate at Perth\u0027s Edith Cowan University, fought attempts to banish him from the campus two years ago.After an uproar and support from scientists globally, the decision was reversed.He has produced dozens of research papers and until recently continued to review and edit for different ecology journals.Israel\u0026#39s Benjamin Netanyahu says he has \u0026#39conclusive proof\u0026#39 Iran lied about its nuclear weapons programmeUK asthma death rates among the worst in EuropeTree crashes on to school softball game injuring 10 people in Pittsburgh suburbJohn Kelly denies calling Donald Trump an \u0026#39idiot\u0026#39 saying it is \u0026#39total BS\u0026#39Mindfulness could help to stave off dementia, research suggests Sotheby\u0026#39s accused of misleading Sultan to pay £725,000 for sculptureThe Woman in White, episode 3 review: a gripping study of domestic abuseRed Cross urges public to sign up as terror attack responders after one of charity\u0026#39s busiest post-war yearsTheresa May considering agreement with Brussels that Brexiteers fear would be \u0026#39EU Mark II\u0026#39 Comment: Israel\u0026#39s only aim is to persuade Donald Trump to scrap the Iran nuclear deal - and it could workWhat the Sainsbury\u0026#39s-Asda deal means for shoppers?Comment: On Iran and Korea, Donald Trump\u0026#39s ambition is the same: to get the world to look after itselfCalls for Spain\u0026#39s justice minister to quit for questioning judge in \u0026#39wolfpack\u0026#39 rape trial Roses could smell sweeter and last for longer after scientists crack genetic codeComment: A wider conflict is coming to the Middle East unless Iran mends its waysComment: Sajid Javid v Diane Abbott: the battle beginsSainsbury\u0026#39s CEO caught on film singing \u0026#39we\u0026#39re in the money\u0026#39Doctors won’t admit to mistakes after prosecution of paediatricianFour skiers dead and five left in critical condition after night stuck outside in Swiss AlpsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000142792471_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqoy0UijBRPlBgfQSD9mX1zUYMapKPjdhyLnv9ax6_too.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"roses could smell sweeter last longer scientists crack genetic","story":"Munstead Wood (Ausbernard) English Rose at David Austin RosesA rose by any other name would smell as sweet, so William Shakespeare’s Juliet famously declared.But a rose that has been genetically improved would smell even sweeter according to scientists who have cracked the DNA code of Britain’s favourite flower.Experts have created the first complete map of the popular flower, which they believe could help restore the heady scene that has dulled in recent years.Researchers said that by developing the blueprint - the first high-quality genome of the flower- they could engineer roses to be more fragrant, more colourful and longer lasting.Due to extensive cross-breeding, modern roses have complex DNA sequences that are difficult to reconstruct and previous attempts to fit together rose DNA molecules have resulted in fragmented and hard-to-read assemblages.But now they have found a way to edit the genes of roses, even if such bouquets are still a few years down the line.For the new work, researchers used advanced techniques to sequence the genome of the species Old Blush (Rosa chinensis). The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Israel\u0026#39s Benjamin Netanyahu says he has \u0026#39conclusive proof\u0026#39 Iran lied about its nuclear weapons programmeUK asthma death rates among the worst in EuropeTree crashes on to school softball game injuring 10 people in Pittsburgh suburbJohn Kelly denies calling Donald Trump an \u0026#39idiot\u0026#39 saying it is \u0026#39total BS\u0026#39Mindfulness could help to stave off dementia, research suggests Australia\u0026#39s oldest scientist, 104, plans to fly to Switzerland to end lifeSotheby\u0026#39s accused of misleading Sultan to pay £725,000 for sculptureThe Woman in White, episode 3 review: a gripping study of domestic abuseRed Cross urges public to sign up as terror attack responders after one of charity\u0026#39s busiest post-war yearsTheresa May considering agreement with Brussels that Brexiteers fear would be \u0026#39EU Mark II\u0026#39 Comment: Israel\u0026#39s only aim is to persuade Donald Trump to scrap the Iran nuclear deal - and it could workWhat the Sainsbury\u0026#39s-Asda deal means for shoppers?Comment: On Iran and Korea, Donald Trump\u0026#39s ambition is the same: to get the world to look after itselfCalls for Spain\u0026#39s justice minister to quit for questioning judge in \u0026#39wolfpack\u0026#39 rape trial Comment: A wider conflict is coming to the Middle East unless Iran mends its waysComment: Sajid Javid v Diane Abbott: the battle beginsSainsbury\u0026#39s CEO caught on film singing \u0026#39we\u0026#39re in the money\u0026#39Doctors won’t admit to mistakes after prosecution of paediatricianFour skiers dead and five left in critical condition after night stuck outside in Swiss AlpsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000161938198_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-fLBx2bsq5a1S3CGjPVQ4C9gK37-FtPvAMvEiDN4qaA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sothebys accused misleading sultan pay 725000 sculpture","story":"Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi has taken the auction house to courtAn Egyptian sculpture being sold through the mother of a Sotheby’s consultant has become the subject of a £725,000 court case, the  can reveal.The sculpture, Au Bord du Nil by Mahmoud Mokhtar, was sold in 2016 to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, who now claims he paid ten times over the odds for it after the date it was made was misrepresented in the auction house catalogue.In a High Court case, it has now emerged that the selling agent of the sculpture, art and antiques dealer Nesreen Farag, is related to a Sotheby’s consultant involved in the sale.The relationship, Al-Qassemi\u0027s legal representatives say, appears to be contrary to Sotheby’s Code of Business Conduct because it could have...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.The introduction does appear to be a test ahead of rolling it out on Facebook more broadly, however, and so the feature is expected to come to more people in the future.Facebook says that the button is for voting down comments that are abusive or disrespectful, so that they will not get promoted to the top of a discussion. As such, it mostly functions like the downvote button on Reddit, allowing people to express their dislike of a comment and offset any positive reactions it might be getting.MPs laugh at Facebook boss during intense grilling in parliamentIn doing so, the feature should be able to make conversations on the platform less centred around those comments that generate the most engagement – whether good or bad.Facebook has been struggling with how exactly to integrate a dislike button since at least 2015, when Mark Zuckerberg noted that not every moment is a good moment. He also noted that any feature would have to be carefully designed to avoid spreading negativity or to be used for bullying.To solve that, Facebook introduced its Reactions – allowing people to not only like something, but also to offer a range of other reactions, such as anger or laughter. But doing so introduced yet another problem: reacting angrily still counted as a reaction, and so content that made people upset was still being engaged with and promoted on the site.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It\u0027s clear that the government must develop a national alcohol strategy to address the harm they and their families face, and include treatment at its heart to reduce the suffering of the four in every five who currently do not access the services they need.This report shows very clearly what action is needed and we urge policy-makers, practitioners and service providers to join together to implement these recommendations to help the hundreds of thousands of people who are in desperate need of support.Press Association contributed to this report. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

It also helps both humans and animals to navigate, and protects our telecommunication and satellite systems.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field foundIf the two magnetic poles were to switch places, something that has happened periodically over the course of Earth’s history, all of this would be compromised.Since 1840, the year scientists began to measure such things, the global strength of the Earth’s magnetic field has been declining at a rate of around 5 per cent per century.This weakening, combined with the expansion of a particularly weak area in the planet’s magnetic field called the South Atlantic Anomaly, led to speculation that Earth’s magnetic fields were about to\u0026nbspreverse.The last time such a “geomagnetic reversal” or “excursion” happened was 780,000 years ago, but coverage of this phenomenon has suggested such an\u0026nbspevent is right around the corner.\u0026nbspAn extract from a book by journalist Alanna Mitchell was published on the science website Undark.The book was titled The Spinning Magnet: The Electromagnetic Force That Created the Modern World — and Could Destroy It, and the extract included a warning that it was “time to wake up to the dangers and start preparing” for a magnetic pole reversal.This warning was picked up with gusto and soon many other articles were popping up warning of the dangers of an imminent pole reversal.However, the new study suggests the worst of these fears may have been unwarranted.Based on the Earth’s history of flipping its magnetic field, something which can be calculated based on magnetics minerals in rocks, they think such an event is unlikely to happen any time soon.“There has been speculation that we are about to experience a magnetic polar reversal or excursion,” said Professor Richard Holme, a geomagnetism expert at the University of Liverpool.Why the Earth’s magnetic poles could be about to swap places – and how“However, by studying the two most recent excursion events, we show that neither bear resemblance to current changes in the geomagnetic field and therefore it is probably unlikely that such an event is about to happen.Our research suggests instead that the current weakened field will recover without such an extreme event, and therefore is unlikely to reverse.Instead, the scientists predict it may take thousands of years before Earth’s magnetic field reverses again.Scientists are certainly aware of the possibility that the Earth’s magnetic field will flip its polarity at some point in the future. As Nasa states in a post on its website from 2011: “Reversals are the rule, not the exception”.In the Undark extract, Ms Mitchell quotes physicist Dr Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, Boulder saying he fears parts of the planet will become uninhabitable during such a reversal.However, the consensus still seems to be that even if such an event did take place, its outcomes would not be as serious as some commentators have made out:“Many doomsday theorists have tried to take this natural geological occurrence and suggest it could lead to Earth\u0027s destruction,” Nasa continued in their post.“But would there be any dramatic effects? The answer, from the geologic and fossil records we have from hundreds of past magnetic polarity reversals, seems to be \u0027no.\u0027”Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped.

The MEPs also warn that EU data protection rules need to be followed during the process, even after the UK has left.The letter comes after a visit to Brussels by Home Office officials last week, who tried to assuage MEPs’ concerns about the registration system.The Brexit coordinator Mr Verhofstadt said: “In a spirit of collaboration, MEPs have today set out a number of proposals in order to ensure the registration of EU citizens in the UK is dealt with in an efficient, flexible, timely and sensitive manner. In light of the Windrush scandal and given the large numbers of citizens affected, both the EU and the UK must work together to get this right.“It is important that the registration process should, as a matter of principle, be cost-free for applicants. It is unacceptable that citizens who were never consulted on Brexit should have to pay large fees to retain their own rights.“The registration system must be responsive, proportionate and cater for vulnerable groups and those who do not use digital devices.“We look forward to knowing more about how the independent authority overseeing the system will operate, what its competence will be and how its independence will be ensured.“It remains a priority for the European Parliament to ensure that citizens, whether the UK citizens in the EU or EU citizens in the UK, can continue to lead their lives as they do now.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But critics cast doubt on whether his words meant an actual change of approach.It was shortly after 10am on Monday that Downing Street announced Mr Javid would take charge of the Home Office from Ms Rudd, who quit amid a row about deportation targets and the Windrush scandal.Critics claim both issues are underpinned by the single-minded drive to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in the UK – instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary.Theresa May admits there were deportation targets when she was home secretaryWith Mr Javid forced to confront anger over the “hostile environment” approach in the Commons by 4pm, he said: “I don’t like the phrase hostile.“So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a country.”I don’t like the phrase hostile. So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a countryBefore quitting, Ms Rudd was reported to have been livid that she was dealing with the fallout of a broad approach to immigration implemented by Ms May.She was quick to tweet praise for Mr Javid’s opening comments on Monday, calling his appearance an “outstanding debut”.It will not have gone unnoticed in Downing Street that the new home secretary suggested language used by the prime minister for years does not reflect British “values”.He also risked provoking anger at Number 10 by saying he would review the use of “internal migration targets” at the Home Office, before deciding whether they should be kept – just hours after the prime minister gave an interview defending them.Boris Johnson clashes with Theresa May after demanding amnesty for all long-standing Commonwealth immigrantsMs May had said: “When I was home secretary we did have targets, targets for ensuring we were dealing with illegal immigrants.“I think if you ask any member of the public they will say that they do want government making sure that people who are here illegally are removed.”Asked whether Ms May wanted targets to continue at the Home Office later in the day, a Downing Street spokesman said it is up to the secretary of state to set “priorities”.It is not the first sign that Ms May’s Cabinet is challenging her long-established approach to immigration, with foreign secretary Boris Johnson recently reported to have called for an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have resided in the country for 10 years or more.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesSajid Javid outside the Home Office in Westminster after he was appointed as the new Home Secretary.

If you talk to members of the public, they want to be reassured that we are dealing with people who are here illegally.”The revelation will sharpen the focus on the role of the prime minister, the architect of the “hostile environment” policy that ended up persecuting the Windrush generation.Crucially, it is believed that any members of the Windrush generation detained for deportation – or prevented from returning to the UK – would have counted towards the now-revealed forced removal target.Jeremy Corbyn said: “Amber Rudd has been a human shield for Theresa May – and now she has gone.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

This enthusiasm for them wanting to make a deal ...

You come back and you have travelled into the future.                Scientists discover evidence of \u0026lsquomental time travel\u0027                Back in time: Scientists see BEGINNING of stars in major breakthroughMoving forward in time IS possible\u0026ldquoIf you want to go into the next century, into the next millennium then it\u0026rsquos easy you just get enough money, go near a black hole, wait a little bit, come back and you are as much as you want in the future.This is because of the way time works.Dr Rovelli says: \u0026ldquoEarth is a big rock and mass slows time.Albert Einstein first proposed the idea that travelling at the speed of light away from Earth would slow down time for the traveller, while those back on Earth would experience time at the normal rate.Have we uncovered some proof that time travel actually exists? See women on mobile phones in the 1920s and uncanny celebrity doppelgangers from the 1800s.                    IG1 of 7At the reopening of South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge in the 1940s a man is seen wearing sunglasses and a modern printed t shirt, dressed differently to the surrounding crowdWhile you are travelling at the speed of light, time stays slow relative to the people who are standing still back on Earth.As a result, you would be going fast while your clocks back on Earth would still be going at the same rate.It is also due to the fact that time passes differently at different heights, with it being slower the higher in Earth\u0026rsquos atmosphere you go.Dr Rovelli quips: \u0026ldquoYour head lives longer than your feet.\u0026ldquoTime is far more complicated than the way we usually think about it. We have a simple idea about time time passes the same for everybody, clocks measure it, past is different from the future.\u0026ldquoBut as soon as we study nature more in general \u0026ndash the universe at large, galaxies, black holes \u0026ndash we realise that time works very differently in our daily experience.As for travelling backwards in time, Dr Rovelli says that is unlikely.He said: \u0026ldquoSorry, but that is harder.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.”Helen was diagnosed with a lung disorder in 2004 called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that forced her to leave her job as a college lecturer.In 2015 she made the decision to contact Dignitas and carried out all the research and payments herself.James, who was in a relationship with Helen for 33 years, said she was in a helpless situation and was in pain and suffering every day.He added: She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’.She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone.We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”When the couple boarded the train to Switzerland, Helens lung capacity was at 15 per cent and she had oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive.After spending their final hours together in a hotel, the pair made their way to the clinic in Zurich where Helen was giving life ending drugs to help her pass away incredibly peacefully.But in a devastating twist of fate, the couples home in West Bromwich in the West Midlands was ransacked by thieves while Helen was ending her life in November 2016.The callous raiders stole Helen’s computer containing cherished photos and wrapped the stolen items in “the last bed sheet she slept in”.Neighbours raised the alarm and told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen so she could end her life.James was then quizzed by cops within hours of arriving back in the UK without his long-term partner.He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”But two months later, he was interviewed under caution and was investigated for six months until the charges were dropped in June 2017 after cops got hold of Helens medical records.James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying and has been in contact with Julie Smith, 48, whose husband Paul died in September 2016.The 57-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer but died in agony as his GP said he could not provide medical records for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”.The disease, also known as AATD or A1AD, is a rare inherited condition that can cause liver and lung problems.Around 25,000 people in the UK have the genetic condition though most remain healthy so few have been diagnosed.Sufferers are much more vulnerable to the effects of inhaling smoke or other toxic materials like dust, fumes or chemicals.The condition increases the risk of lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It costs around £10,000 for a person to go to Dignitas to end their life with the sentence for assisting a suicide up to 14 years in jail.A West Midlands Police spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year.“That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brazilian surfer rodrigo koxa world record biggest wave 80ft","story":"Rodrigo Koxa risked his life when he decided to take on the wave on November 8, 2017, during a surf competition in Nazare, Portugal.In this incredible video, the Brazilian surfer appears as a tiny speck in comparison to the massive wave he’s surfing that crashes around him.Koxa surfed the wave last year, but the record was officially confirmed on Saturday night at the World Surf League’s Big Wave Awards in California.

She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger”.In a declaration that will sound alarm in Downing Street, Mr Javid was also swift to rubbish the ‘hostile environment’ mantra, a phrase used by Theresa May herself just last week.Instead, he would refer to policies to make it harder for illegal immigrants to prosper here as “compliant environment”, telling MPs: “I don’t like the phrase hostile. It’s not a phrase I’m going to use. It doesn’t represent the values of our country”.And hinting he is ready to make major changes to introduce a more liberal immigration policy, Mr Javid added: “It’s not just about a personnel change. It’s about action, and that’s why she’ll be seeing from my department”.But he said he is yet to decide on whether to continue with deportation targets, the controversial issue that Ms Rudd had to resign over after inadvertently misleading the Commons when she said last week they didn’t exist.Mr Javid immediately won the praise of his predecessor Ms Rudd, who tweeted: Outstanding debut by fantastic Sajid Javid in House of Commons today.But he risked angering his ageing mother by admitting he was yet to call her, but pledged: “I will do later”.Mr Javid’s elevation now makes him the boss of his younger brother Bas, who is a Chief Superintendent with West Midlands Police.Mr Javid has already ran for the Tory leadership once, on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb against Theresa May in 2016. But they were eliminated in the first round of voting.Ms Rudd’s Cabinet exit has slashed the number of women around Theresa May’s top table down to just 22% in a blow for one of her own personal goals.Just five out of the Cabinets 23 full members are now women, after the PM failed to replace the outgoing Home Secretary with another woman.A further four female ministers are allowed to attend Cabinet.Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt took over Rudd’s Women and Equalities brief yesterday in addition to her aid responsibilities. Despite it being just day one on the job, Mr Javid was bombarded with calls from many quarters to reform the government’s creaking immigration policy.He also inherits a huge in tray, from also drawing up tough new terrorism laws to conquering rising gun and knife crime, and devising a new post-Brexit immigration system for EU citizens. Yesterday MEPs gave the new Home Secretary one of his first headaches in office as they voiced concerns over the registration process for EU citizens.In a letter to Mr Javid, the EU parliament’s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt laid out a series of demands for the settled status scheme.MEPs also want applications to be cleared within 48 hours, with those who don’t receive a response within that time presumed to have been successful.Finally, in a sign of how low trust in the Home Office has sunk, the Parliament demanded to see evidence of how it will finance the scheme.The letter follows a presentation by Home Office officials in Brussels last week at which it emerged their flagship registration app doesn’t work properly on iPhones.Through hard graft and natural wit, he has gone from growing up on Britain’s most crime ridden street to the Home Office’s HQ on Marsham Street.On Bristol’s notorious Stapleton Road, he shared a cramped two bedroom flat with his parents and FOUR brothers until the age of 12.It was opposite a brothel, and a prostitute used to stand outside.“I didn’t know what a prostitute was at the time,” Sajid told me during the 2015 general election campaign. “For me, it was home”.Both parents were first generation Brits, immigrating from the Punjab in Pakistan – his father with just £1 in his pocket when he arrived.Dad Abdul eventually escaped the Rochdale cotton mill to realise his ambition of becoming a bus driver, before achieving his next one of owning his own clothes shop with a family move down south to Bristol.A childhood highlight for Sajid came twice a year when, as a special treat, the boys’ father would rent a VHS player for a weekend and leave them to binge on all the latest movies, until it went back to the shop on Monday.From being able to speak only Punjabi when he first went to nursery aged three, Sajid won a place at Exeter University.From there, he went into the City and made millions, becoming the youngest ever vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25.All his success he attributes to his mum and dad.The MP for Bromsgrove still lives by his father’s favourite mantra.“You get back what you put in, my dad would often say,” he also told me.It was the Falklands War two years on that “awoke my patriotism”, he said.“I wouldn’t miss a single night of the TV news and I bought all the newspapers, I had to follow every turn.”Sajid’s proud father saw his son elected to Parliament in 2010, but died of cancer a year later, and didn’t witness his elevation to the government as a junior Treasury minister in 2012, having caught the keen eye of then Chancellor George Osborne.He entered the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2014, going on to serve as Business Secretary in 2015, and Housing Secretary in 2016.A father of three himself now, the 48-year-old appears far from finished yet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this means London swings to Labour, then it’s also likely to mean much of the rest of England will swing to Conservative.”He added: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even those they have lost more seats in London.”The Strathcylde University Professor – Britain’s most famous so-called psephologist – received a knighthood in the Queen’s 2018 New Year’s honours list.He has accurately predicted the last four general elections, including last June’s surprise results where he correctly said the Conservatives would lose their majority.The forecast came as separate research claimed voters were “anxious” about the state of the country – led by fury over the housing crisis.Deborah Mattinson at Britain Thinks added that young 18-30 voters were “more gloomy than older voters” and felt a “strong sense of injustice”.She said: “Seven out of ten no longer think it pays to work hard.”Some 4,410 seats are being contested on Thursday across 150 councils. Just over 40 per cent are in London.Sir John said: “Because London accounts for 42 per cent of seats, there is a risk that the headline tally of seats won or lost will be misleading.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is taking Lexlaw to a tribunal alleging constructive dismissal, but is said to be “entirely sanguine” about airing details of his kinky activities.Sources close to Mr Jones insist the spanking was consensual and the couple did not have sex.But he is said to be keen to protect the “very junior employee” involved in a tryst that sent rumbles through London’s stuffy Inns of Court.Mr Jones told legal blog RollOnFriday that he was suspended last June just a day after he rejected a request from Lexlaw’s managing director to reconsider his resignation amid a salary dispute.The lawyer said the spanking session had happened long before he quit and claimed it was only raised so Lexlaw would not have to pay him for his notice period.Mr Jones studied at Cambridge from 1996 to 2000, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a special prize in astrophysics before studying law. He joined Lexlaw in October 2012 and specialised in corporate finance, before leaving last year to become a freelance barrister.On the row, Mr Jones said: “I had a consensual BDSM relationship with another employee, which included one brief incident in private on work premises several months before the disciplinary proceedings.“I was appalled to find out that my employer was monitoring my personal communications over a period of at least several months.”He claims the disciplinary action was in “retaliation” for him handing in his notice and “not a result of the much earlier incident”.A spokesman for Lexlaw confirmed “inappropriate workplace activities” had taken place last year involving a senior barrister.They declined to comment further other than to say: “The activities that took place are as unacceptable in our workplace as they would no doubt be in any workplace.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scientists claim animal fats raise levels of the hormone oestrogen, which may impact fertility.Eating oily fish and beans was also found to delay the menopause by more than three years, thanks to their high levels of antioxidants.But insulin spikes triggered by consumption of refined carbohydrates like pasta are believed to speed up a woman’s periods and earlier menopause.Researcher Professor Janet Cade, from the School of Food Science and Nutrition at Leeds University, said: The age at which menopause begins can have serious health implications for some women.A clear understanding of how diet affects the start of natural menopause will be very beneficial to those who may already be at risk or have a family history of certain complications related to menopause. A higher intake of vitamin B6 and zinc also appeared to delay the onset.Women who suffer later menopause are more likely to develop breast, womb, and ovarian cancers. The study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, followed 14,172 Brit women for four years.More than 900 experienced the start of menopause during the research.Lead author Yashvee Dunneram, of the School of Food Science and Nutrition, said: This study is the first to investigate the links between individual nutrients and a wide variety of food groups and age at natural menopause in a large cohort of British women.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But then I couldn’t have imagined the abuse the elephants suffer.“Now I know, and I think everyone else needs to see this and know too.”Arthur is one of 50 elephants kept in pain and terror at an “elephant temple” in Guruvayur, in Kerala, South India.It is a popular destination for thousands of the more than 850,000 Brits who visit India each year.Evanna, who is also an avid animal rights campaigner, continued: “I have been so shocked. We saw one elephant chained up — it couldn’t move at all.“It had a stick resting on its head so if it moved the stick would fall. If it did the trainer would give it a beating.“I asked the man standing there how long the elephant might have been there, and he told me probably his whole life. That is unfathomable.”India’s elephants are snatched from their mothers in the wild when they are babies and taken to secret “training camps”. Here they are beaten, starved and tortured into complete submission in a process called “pajan”.The first step is for the beasts to be forced into a kraal or “crushing cage”.This is a wooden structure designed to keep the elephant so tightly caged it cannot move — not even to turn around, nod its head or sit down.Trainers then starve the animal and keep it awake for days on end.Exhausted and on the brink of death, the elephants are then beaten with wooden weapons, specially designed to inflict as much pain as possible.This happens every day for at least six months, but can go on for years.When finally their spirit is so broken that they let their trainers ride them, they are deemed safe enough to be rented out or sold to tourist attractions and temples across India.Nearly half of the elephants die from this abuse, and of those who survive to be sold, another ten per cent die within a year due to stress. But their suffering is a tourism goldmine.Elephants can be rented out for rides, festivals or to temples for anything from £34 to £1,600 a day — in a country where the average labourer only makes £10 a day.While much of the most violent training takes place out of sight of tourists, the brutal reality of elephants’ lives is far from hidden.When we arrive at Kerala’s Kochi airport a giant elephant statue welcomes us, complete with chains around its feet.Within half an hour of being on the road we are overtaken on a motorway by a rusty truck carrying an elephant tied down by chains, wires and rope. Seconds later another passes.They are being transported from camps across the country to one of India’s famous elephant festivals, Thrissur Pooram, in Thrissur, Kerala.We are on our way to the same event, where we find more than 90 elephants have been shipped in. They are dressed up and forced to stand in front of huge crowds while cannons fire and drums are banged for hours.With the help of our guide we gain access to a backstage holding pen for the animals, out of sight of visitors.In this dark, corrugated-iron structure the animals are heavily chained, unable to move or access water. Each has at least one trainer guarding it with sticks, and every animal looks terrified.Many have gaping wounds on their feet and backs — not a problem for the trainers who simply paint the wounds grey to cover up the injuries from the tourists.In order to discover more about what these beasts have been through, Evanna and I travel two hours north into deep forest to the village of Kodanad, where our guide tells us there is a training camp. After some careful negotiations with guards we manage to enter, posing as tourists who “just want to see the elephants”. Inside we see the terrible, stark reality of their lives.Chained to tree stumps, they are in appalling condition.Autoor is 16 years old and we find her swaying her head from side to side, over and over again — a sign of huge distress.It is impossible not to want to comfort her, but before we get too close a trainer approaches and whacks her with a stick, she immediately stops swaying, instead standing completely still.We quickly move on until we find a clearing in the forest. It is here we find the saddest of sights — a lone elephant locked in a crushing cage.The wooden cell stands so tall at first it is almost impossible to make out the elephant stuck inside.Then the trainers arrive and begin hitting and stabbing the elephant through the cage with large sticks.It is too much to bear and, with our guide getting increasingly anxious about our pictures being discovered, we quickly leave.I ask our guide, is this how all elephants are trained, or are some tamed more humanely?His response is chilling: “This is every single tourist elephant’s fate. The only reason they obey is with fear. They have been broken.”Duncan McNair, founder of charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE) is campaigning for a law banning UK holiday firms and tour companies advertising trips for these sorts of encounters with animals.He says: “Elephants are some of the most intelligent, emotional creatures in the world and the abuse they suffer is unimaginable.“Those horrors ensure the rest of their life is lived in fear.“I’m confident that if any tourist ever saw this, or even a small aspect of it, they would be appalled.”With tears in her eyes, Evanna said: “When people who have ridden elephants in the past or visited these places see this article, I don’t want them to feel guilty — they were misled by the irresponsible tourist industry.“What we need to do is to put that guilt into action and not visit these places in future.“I’d read a lot about the abuse elephants suffer but seeing it up close has given me the ability to speak from my heart and tell others that we can make a change by not spending our money and posting these tourist images.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “This my Lords is a wrecker’s amendment. And I wish it ill.”Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts sparked uproar in the chamber by comparing the proposed Bill to something out of Nazi Germany.He said: “My mind went back to Berlin in March 1933, when the Enabling Bill was passed in the Reichstag.That transferred democratic rights of the parliament into the hands of one man. His name was Adolf Hitler.”Brexit Minister Steve Baker slammed the “disgraceful, irresponsible rhetoric”.Lib Dem peers said they were “in the driving seat” over Brexit. Lord Newby added it was “vital that Parliament, not the Government, decides whether or not any Brexit deal is acceptable”.MPs will now vote on the amendment. Crossbench peer Lord Malloch-Brown, chairman of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: “This feels like a turning point.This is a massive defeat for the Government.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evidence from health groups found that US companies are “particularly keen to gain access to the public health systems of Europe”.The International Trade committee recommends working across parties to achieve political consensus on its post-Brexit trade policy because trade deals are likely to take years to negotiate and could involve governments led by different parties over the coming years.SNP MP and chair of the International Trade committee Angus MacNeil said: “It would be a catastrophic error to rush into negotiations with the US without a comprehensive trade strategy.“The economic benefits of a US deal are presently unproven. The Government appears to be engaged in an exercise in doublethink: on the one hand telling us that new trade deals will be the pot of gold at the end of the Brexit rainbow, while simultaneously saying it’s too soon to offer a realistic estimate of the possible contents or benefits a deal with its highest-priority target.”“Even in ideal circumstances, trade-offs will have to be made to get a comprehensive US deal. Without a trade strategy, we have no idea what these may be. Will the Government, in their rush to secure the future of the UK services sector, sacrifice UK agriculture or manufacturing? What does the Government intend to do to help industries if they are negatively affected by this bargain?“It was clear in our inquiry that questions about trade with the EU and with the US cannot be answered in isolation. Will the UK align its regulations with the US, and risk erecting impenetrable trade barriers with our other global partners, particularly the EU?If there is a clash between the regulatory regimes of the EU and the US, which does the Government plan to prioritise? These issues need to be worked out, not just before negotiating a deal with the US, but also before we finalise our future trading relationship with the EU.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the application was eventually successful.Mr Brokenshire’s appointment as the new Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government comes just weeks after he had a cancerous tumour removed from his right lung.He quit as Northern Ireland Secretary in January ahead of the surgery.His embarrassing nimbyism came as housing groups piled on the pressure for Mr Brokenshire to get a grip of the “biggest housing emergency in decades”.Housing charity Shelter said: “With the lowest levels of social housebuilding since the second world war and rough sleeping is its highest for a decade, we hope the new Secretary of State will take the bold action needed to fix our broken housing market. We very much look forward to working with him to achieve this.”National Housing Federation chief David Orr said: “Genuinely affordable homes are desperately needed. Though housing associations are committed to delivering on the government’s rightly ambitious house-building targets, they urgently need government to make more affordable land available to achieve this.”Mr Brokenshire, 50, has been a close ally of the Prime Minister since serving under her from 2010-16 at the Home Office, where he was responsible for the crime prevention, security and immigration briefs.He led negotiations that secured the deportation of Islamist militant Abu Qatada in 2013 after an eight-year battle.The father-of-three was first appointed shadow minister for crime reduction by David Cameron in opposition in 2006.Born in Southend-on-Sea, Mr Brokenshire studied law at Exeter University and worked for 13 years at international law firm Jones Day, where he became a partner.He entered Parliament as MP for Hornchurch and Rainham in 2005, contesting his current seat at the next election after the constituency was abolished under boundary changes.Speaking shortly after his return to the Commons after cancer treatment, non-smoker Mr Brokenshire described how he was prompted to see his GP after coughing up a small amount of blood.“I trusted my instincts because deep down I knew something really wasn’t right,” he said.“I didn’t delay in going to see my GP, trusted his advice in seeing a consultant and followed things through.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
