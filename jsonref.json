Sir Elton, 72, opened up to Sharon Osbourne on her American chat show, The Talk         Sir Elton had called Sharon after George Michael died almost three years agoHe said the singer was ‘beset by confusion as a consequence of his sexuality’ and struggled to ‘define the reality beneath the public image’, causing a tension which ‘only seemed to play out more publicly later on.’‘Beyond the close inner circle nobody really had a clue, so while the reality of maintaining the façade wasn’t tearing George apart, some cracks were definitely starting to show,’ he wrote.He said that Michael’s ‘ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.’According to Ridgeley, the pop star struggled with the public persona he created so he didn’t have to reveal his true self.‘The persona which he constructed for public consumption hadn’t left George with a lot of space in which to develop his true self behind the scenes,’ he wrote.‘He was driven by an unstoppable desire to fulfil his potential, but that had come at a price. As a young man still trying to find himself, George’s ambition to succeed had taken priority over everything else and that included his ability to openly express his sexuality.’         Sharon Osbourne spoke to Sir Elton about his close friend George He said that his decision to stay silent about his private life ‘only fed the uncertainty about his public persona.‘What the real implications were for George, I can’t say, but I knew he was never comfortable with the added interest that came with Wham! hitting the big time.’He added: ‘While on tour, working with Wham!, George was presenting a public image that didn’t come naturally to him.’He said that George was ‘adamant his sexuality should be kept under wraps’ which ‘created a whole unwelcome extra level of stress for him to manage.’He added: ‘I had certainly never met any boyfriend that George might have had while we were together as a band.‘He thought coming out would scupper chances of competing with artists like Madonna and Michael Jackson in the States.’Michael refused to come out even after his boyfriend Anselmo Feleppa died from AIDs in 1993. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5010bf36815e28900ef773ca2262503c126bca5c/0_91_3749_2249/master/3749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82c64af5948f65c3fea80f80cc178373","title":"rihanna mobbed by french fans dennis leupold best photograph","story":"‘A huge crowd surrounded the car. It was quite eerie, almost scary. Even for her that moment was crazy’ Rihanna’s French fans are wild. They love her so much and they run for several blocks behind her car when she’s travelling through the city. This shot was taken at Paris fashion week in 2014. It was the first day she arrived in Paris and so things were especially intense.We’d just left the Balmain show and it was really hard to get through this huge crowd of people to the car. When we got inside we were instantly surrounded by people. If you look closely, one of the fans outside has their phone set to record mode – I don’t think you can actually see anything through the glass but they’re still trying. It was quite eerie, almost a little scary. Rihanna is more used to these kinds of situations than other people, but even for her that moment was kind of crazy.Before I met Rihanna I was fascinated by her as a pop star and as a person. She seemed very bold, very authentic and very fun. Before the Diamonds world tour in 2013 she asked me to come along and capture what happens between concerts. We got along well, so we kept working together. She already had a book in mind when we met, and that’s what we’ve spent the last six years doing. This shot was one of the key images for it. She didn’t want it to feature anything posed or set up – she wanted it to capture her life out of her eyes. So even on red carpets with a lot of paparazzi I would have to try to find a fresh angle – maybe include the photographers in the shot, or show a different perspective.Obviously, as a photographer, Rihanna is the best subject you can ask for. She’s very comfortable in front of the camera. The key thing was building a relationship with her. I can kind of feel her mood to know when it’s the right time to shoot, and what kind of pictures she would like. You don’t want to interrupt her workflow. She’s so dedicated to the cause, whatever she does: make up, music, styling. She will not ever do anything she doesn’t believe in. She works crazy hours. It’s awesome to witness.When you spend 24 hours a day with someone – on a jet, on a bus – you become very close. But it was always important that I knew my assignments and remained professional. I would go to an after party with her but maybe go home at 2am and start editing pictures.Rihanna’s very aware of the people around her and she helps them grow with her. Working with her has helped my career in every way. I’ve got to shoot people you would normally never get to shoot. I’ve got pictures of Rihanna and Karl Lagerfeld together – the access has been incredible. It’s also presented me with lots of challenges. When you’re shooting in a studio you get to dictate everything that’s going to happen on your set. But on tour, when you’re taking a picture at 4am with no light and you can’t use a flash, the situation dictates what sort of photo you can take. It really challenges you to get a good picture.Luckily, there is a trust between us. I think she felt OK to show a side to her that she might not show to other people or photographers.• Rihanna is published by Phaidon, £120.Training: I learned myself, from working with all kinds of amazing photographers.Influences: “Peter Lindbergh is the main one – he grew up in the same town and was always the person I look up to.”Low point: “When I started in 2007 there was a recession in the US. It was a very hard time to be a new photographer.”Top tip: “Be true to yourself. Don’t look at what trends are happening. Your perspective is unique to you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48ce4e47d7c5250256b33af03341edd2ce8bbd7/65_568_1094_656/master/1094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d874bfc9560475406b88e7e9ade56d7b","title":"down with god how the soviet union took on religion in pictures","story":"Marx said religion was the opium of the people – and in the Soviet Union, atheism became government policy, enforced by the state and encouraged by anti-religious posters and magazines.

It is written by Jean-Yves Ferri and drawn by Didier Conrad, the team behind the last three books. They have remained close to the original format started by the writer René Goscinny and cartoonist Albert Uderzo, who mentored both Conrad and Ferri.However, the creation of Adrenaline is a big leap away from the blonde, femme fatales who usually turn up in the Asterix comics.“We didn’t want to develop a character who would be based on her seductive side as we usually do with female characters in Asterix. Most of the time they are young attractive women who seduce Obelix and their role stops there,” Conrad said.In the latest book, Asterix and Obelix are tasked with protecting Adrenaline from the Romans, who have captured her father. However, this proves difficult for these two heroes, as her rebellious spirit disturbs the village’s day-to-day life.“In terms of the vocabulary it was quite amusing because I had to create a sort of teenage language for the time. We don’t have a lot of documentation about that. So the idea was to use certain expressions like teenagers do,” said Ferri.In reply to a reporter, Ferri and Conrad said the similarities between spirited Adrenaline and teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg were purely fortuitous.Set in 50BC in Roman-occupied Gaul, the Asterix books have become a mainstay in the publishing industry, with more than 370m copies sold worldwide.Five million copies of the French edition of Asterix and the Chieftain’s Daughter have been printed, with 2m of those remaining in France where new Asterix books frequently top the bestseller charts.As well as being translated into more than 100 languages, the books have inspired a dozen movies and cartoon series, making it a global phenomenon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec32ffb639d120a3848d7f1599ab6bc6c4c114c/0_162_3616_2170/master/3616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaa57b1a28a255db9a2a9af074d9e53f","title":"brussels allows uk to subsidise fossil fuel generators","story":"Controversial energy scheme had been halted by European court The UK’s largest fossil fuel generators may be back in line for almost £1bn in backup power subsidies this winter after the European commission approved the UK’s flagship energy scheme that was ruled illegal last year.A shock European court ruling brought the government’s “capacity market” to a standstill last November, triggering an in-depth investigation into whether the UK’s plan to pay power plants to stay open was compatible with EU state aid law.The commission’s green light is expected to clear the way for payments of around £990m to the owners of Britain’s gas, coal and nuclear power plants to guarantee they will keep the lights on this winter.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, said she expected that the capacity market would also pay back £1bn owed to generators for last winter when the capacity market was suspended.Leadsom said the commission’s approval should enable the capacity market to resume its role as the UK’s principal tool for assuring the UK’s electricity security of supply. The decision provided confidence that its design was fit for purpose, she said.Under the scheme, energy companies bid years in advance for billpayer-funded subsidies to provide backup power at crunch times during winter. It was approved by the European commission in 2014, but called into question last year after the energy startup Tempus Energy successfully appealed to the European court of justice against the approval.Tempus Energy said the scheme put energy-saving schemes at a disadvantage by overlooking the potential to balance the energy system using measures that reduced energy demand in favour of ramping up energy supplies.Sam Bright, an energy lawyer at ClientEarth, said: “The litigation brought by Tempus gave the UK government and the European commission breathing space to reconsider whether a scheme of this nature was really necessary. Sadly, rather than take this opportunity for a major rethink, which could have brought the British electricity market into the 21st century, the commission is allowing the government to keep pumping electricity consumers’ money into 20th-century infrastructure.”Coal company Drax said it expected to receive £75m from the government for generating electricity in the current financial year. The German energy firm RWE, which runs a string of UK gas plants and the Aberthaw coal plant in Wales, expects to receive €100m for last year and €180m for the current financial year.SSE is also expected to rake in strong returns from the capacity market for its gas power plants and EDF Energy is in line for a windfall for its existing nuclear power fleet.Roger Miesen, the chief executive officer of RWE Generation, said: “The capacity market has proven that it can successfully deliver security of supply at the lowest cost to consumers. The commission’s conclusion provides the necessary certainty to plant operators and is great news, because the capacity market is crucial for security of supply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc9366c10ccd91d504e49c98d8f380c5ca38f7de/0_88_3338_2002/master/3338.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=341b215e444a6108c3440f90426bb572","title":"mario draghi ecb eight years euro economics eurozone business live","story":"Mario Draghi warns that geopolitical risks are threatening the eurozone recovery, as he gives his final press conference as president of the European Central BankThe pound has fallen back to $1.281 amid rumours that Boris Johnson may push for a general election again today.That’s a loss of roughly one cent today.Our Politics Live blog has all the action:Not everyone in Germany dislikes Mario Draghi because of his expansive monetary policy.For the time being, Draghi will be the president who brought the ECB to new professional levels, in terms of communication, institutional set-up and toolkit of monetary policy instruments.And the ECB president who saved the eurozone from falling apart, only with words. Arrivederci, Mario.Draghi’s gloomy prognosis shows that his successor, Christine Lagarde, faces a tough task at the ECB.Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International, says she may need to unleash further stimulus measures of her own:With limited room for further manoeuvres, it will be all the ECB can manage to keep the eurozone economy on a stable, albeit very slow, growth path. Indeed, further asset purchases and even more negative interest rates may prove detrimental in the long run. Negative rates, in particular, place a heavy burden on banks’ profitability, challenging their traditional business models, while forcing savers to take additional risks in their search for a positive income stream. “As highlighted vigorously by Draghi at almost every press conference during his time in office, the ECB needs the support from governments and fiscal policy if things are really to change. However, for this to happen, circumstances may have to get a little worse before they get better, and markets may have to continue to rely on the ECB to provide a backstop for some time to come.”Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, says politicians should heed Draghi’s recommendation to raise spending (where possible):The man that perhaps embodied the superstar central banker more than any other can think about other things now.Investors wait to see which parts of his legacy Christine Lagarde takes forward and whether her much-vaunted political skills can find a way to help the Eurozone out of the current malaise. Meanwhile, investors need to keep an eye on the on-going debate on German fiscal stimulus. Fiscal easing represent a potentially more potent form of support for the economy as monetary policy appears to be reaching its limits.”We heard a familiar message from Mario Draghi today, says Andrew Wilson of Goldman Sachs Asset Management:He also continues to advocate for fiscal policy to play a more active role in supporting growth, a message echoed by policymakers during the Autumn IMFWorld Bank meetings, with monetary policy increasingly being perceived as insufficient to address growth challenges such as trade protectionism.Here’s some Twitter reaction to Draghi’s last press conference at the ECB - some highly complimentary, some less so....Mario Draghi has used his final appearance as Europe’s top central banker to warn that the eurozone economy remains weak.Sounding like a man spying clouds on the horizon, he declared:The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside.In particular, these risks pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.”The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in early September confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in the euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risk, and muted inflation pressures.” He also cited Brexit as a key geopolitical risk, even though a hard Brexit currently looks less likely:One has the sense that somehow the lower likelihood of a hard Brexit or a cliff edge has improved the overall situation. On the other, the uncertainty is still there.As he’s done so many times, Draghi warned that the eurozone needs to be strengthened -- with increased government spending where possible, and a stronger “fiscal capability”.Draghi also conducted a staunch defence of his legacy, insisting that the unorthodox monetary policy pushed through on his watch had worked.He cited to the fall in bond yields in Greece as proof, while acknowledging the policies were unpopular in Germany.And while he won’t reveal his next move (the presidency of Italy must come up eventually...), he apparently won’t be joining social media. Shame really.Q: You are credited with saving the euro with three words....but your policies are criticised across the region. One day, a country may decide that the euro is not irreversible ....Should you have done more to reach out to the public? And will Italy ever fix itself?Things have changed completely in Italy in recent years, Draghi replies. Everyone there agrees that the euro is irreversible.And on the broader point, Draghi says more can and should be done to reach out to the public. However, it’s hard across 19 countries, and it’s tricky to change your language for a different audience. Draghi insists that central bankers can’t get away with opaque language, declaringNo-one would ever say ‘if you understood me, you were stupid’. We all try to be transparent today.Well, he has given us a lot to write about over the years.....Q: When you started, Greece was in a bailout programme. Now, it just sold bonds at a negative yield - so was the Greek programme a successDraghi says that the policies implemented in Greece are paying off. But it also shows the dangers of ending these policies.It’s a good time for Greece, he adds.Q: How can the eurozone be improved?Draghe says it needs a “central fiscal capacity” -- perhaps a budget, or some insurance measures , that would kick in when economies hit trouble.He concedes, though, that concerns over ‘moral hazard’ have prevented it happening (the risk that a country borrows recklessly, and leaves its neighbours with the bill).Asked whether he might become president of Italy, Draghi insists that you’ll have to ask his wife!Obviously he’s just trying to deflect questions about his future. But Serena Draghi comes from a noble family (descended from the Grand Duke of Tuscany), so maybe she really is the power in the marriage.Q: What will you take from your time at the ECB?It was a very intense, profound, fascinating experience, but I won’t say more, Draghi replies.Q: What do you say to those who say you have stopped monetary policy from being boring?One should always attempt to be not boring, Draghi replies (it’s really not something he could be accused of, really).Draghi then turns to political issues.He agrees that there is more political pressure on central bankers, but rather less on the ECB than on other banks.He then reminds politicians that if they want higher interest rates, they need to take fiscal measures -- spending more, rather than relying on monetary policy.Q: Do you think politicians have heard your message about spending and structural reforms?Draghi says the issue is not simple. Countries with fiscal space should act, but those who don’t should create the conditions for “automatic stabilisers’ to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e8606fb48181f319e4082c825ab7053afc2115/0_0_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6961c7cdda321fa2e86888eba535176a","title":"tell us south african cities after apartheid","story":"We would like to speak to people about their views and experiences of city life in the country since the demise of the brutal political regimeThis year marks 25 years since the end of apartheid in South Africa, a brutal political system that enforced the segregation of people of different races.From 1948 to 1994 the ision was formalised by law, ensuring the minority white population controlled wealth and power, while black people were oppressed and stripped of basic rights, such as the right to vote.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially.

Here are some of the worst offendersWhen I was a kid, my dad stopped the car at every historical marker on our family vacations. He thought he was educating us. But too often these markers were telling us things that never happened and leaving out important things that did. Here’s a quick tour of 10 of the worst historic sites in the US.In Almo, Idaho, a slab of stone carved into the shape of Idaho memorializes a shocking incident in the history of the west: “Dedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives in a horrible Indian massacre, 1861. Three hundred immigrants west bound. Only five escaped.”The only problem with this marker is that 300 immigrants were not killed in 1861. Thirty were not three were not. It never happened at all. A fine western historian, Brigham Madsen, devoted years of research to showing that this event could not have happened. Why, then, does the marker stay up? Well, it’s the biggest thing that ever happened in Almo, even though it never happened!At the lower tip of Manhattan stands a granite portrayal of a nearly naked Native American, a clothed and befrocked Dutchman, and about $24 worth of beads. It marks the exact spot where this famous purchase of Manhattan never took place. A moment’s thought makes obvious that this story is absurd. Would you trade your village, gardens, your hunting rights on Manhattan, fishing rights around the island – for this paltry string of beads? And do what? Move to New Jersey? People already live across the Hudson, so you’d have to talk with them, perhaps fight with them, before simply moving in …Then consider the clothing. I have been in Manhattan in February, and if this purchase that never took place took place in February, that is one cold Native American person. I have also been in Manhattan in August, and if this purchase took place in August, then that Dutchman is about to suffer heat exhaustion. To put it another way, no two people were ever dressed so differently on the same spot on Earth on the same date. We miss noticing this because we are used to portraying Natives as “primitive” – nearly naked – and Europeans as “civilized” – elegantly clothed.Finally, consider the most famous street in America, Wall Street, named for the wall that the Dutch built at the northern edge of New Amsterdam to deter attacks from the indigenous owners of the island. Its name also exposes the ridiculousness of the $24 story.Overlooking the Atlantic in Newport, Rhode Island, stands two-thirds of a large granite globe, symbolizing the “two thirds of the earth” that Portuguese explorers “discovered”. Of course, from Goa to Angola to Brazil, people already lived there, but they didn’t really count they were not Europeans.In the last five years, especially since the white supremacist events in Charleston and Charlottesville, the celebrations of racism that used to dot our landscape from Boston to Seattle and San Diego to Key West have come under attack. The largest of these was the Jefferson Davis Highway, which stretched from Arlington, Virginia, to Richmond and Biloxi and on to San Diego before turning north and terminating at the Canadian border north of Bellingham, Washington. Just this year Arlington renamed its portion of the route, and markers signifying it have also been removed in California and Washington. The only reason this 4,300-mile highway was ever named for Davis was to tell Americans that he was great and we should honor him. And we did not do so because he had been a good senator in the 1840s or secretary of war in the 1850s – no, we honored him because he led a movement that committed treason on behalf of slavery and white supremacy.Lee’s surrender at Appomattox ended the larger part of the civil war. In 1926, the United Daughters of the Confederacy marked the end of the army with a plaque at Appomattox saying “Here … Lee surrendered 9000 men, the remnant of an army still unconquered in spirit, to 118,000 men under Grant.” (The last line has been removed but can still be read.) This plaque gets the numbers all wrong – not by accident, but as part of the “Lost Cause” narrative concocted to persuade white Americans that the southern cause was honorable and defeated only by the north’s vastly superior manpower.Historic houses usually tell heroic stories about their builders, leaving out any “bad parts”. Since we deemed homosexuality “bad” until the very recent past, our public history rarely acknowledged the sexual orientations of gays and lesbians. Surely the most outrageous of these sites is Wheatland, President James Buchanan’s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Visitors don’t learn that he was probably homosexual – or much else about him.There isn’t much doubt about Buchanan’s orientation. For years while serving in the US Senate he lived with William Rufus King, senator from Alabama. The two were inseparable writers referred to them as “the Siamese twins” and called King Buchanan’s “better half” and “his wife”. When in 1844 King was appointed minister to France, Buchanan wrote: “I am now ‘solitary and alone,’ having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them.”Wheatland denies all this, as well as denying that Buchanan, like King, was pro-slavery.Every year, the marker program in Texas puts up more than 250 markers, more than most states have ever put up. Some simply don’t merit a sign. Surely that’s true of the plaque for the Magale Building in downtown Galveston, which tells that it used to house “a well-known paint and hardware store”.Texas also announces that the Wright brothers were not the first to fly that honor goes to the “Baptist minister and inventor Burrell Cannon”, who in 1902 flew an airship inspired by “a craft described in the Biblical book of Ezekiel”. The only problem was, it was powered by four vertically mounted paddlewheels. A paddlewheel works fine on a river, because there’s a difference between water and air, but on an airplane, whatever lift the wheel generates from its downward motion is dissipated by its later upward motion. As the Rev Cannon admitted later: “God never willed that this airship should fly.”Deaf and blind since early childhood, no American struggled more mightily to be heard than Helen Keller. As every schoolchild knows, she learned to write and even to speak. But our public history has silenced her. In 2009, Alabama replaced an out-of-fashion Confederate with Keller in the US Capitol, but not the adult Keller, who became a supporter of the NAACP and a founder of the ACLU. Instead, Alabama installed a statue of her at age seven. All other representations in America’s “Hall of Fame” are of adults. Keller’s birthplace in Tuscumbia similarly freezes her in childhood.I don’t think that Alabama’s leaders fear that if Americans learned that Keller was a leftwing activist, we’d all follow suit. I suspect it’s mere manners: we aren’t supposed to say anything bad about the dead, and socialism is bad, right? For whatever reason, however, Keller has been hushed.If Alabama has quieted a woman who spoke, Wyoming has given voice to one who never said anything. Wyoming was first in the nation to let women vote, as early as 1869. Later, two Wyoming residents decided it would be nice to credit a woman for so doing and chose Esther Morris, who had served briefly as a justice of the peace in 1870. Unfortunately, historians today agree that Morris had nothing to do with the law. Nevertheless, her statues stand at the state capitol and in Washington DC, where she is credited merely with being “present at a dinner in Cheyenne given for Susan B Anthony” in 1895!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4d20c38cc36a2c03104a0bcb83897ca80c29ce5/0_161_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa18cbbc5a6d85b35c19849cc12d11d","title":"youth theatre booker prize acting creativity bernardine evaristo","story":"Acting onstage was how I discovered my creativity, away from class and racial isionAt the age of 12 I discovered Stage Centre, a former church in Plumstead, south-east London where a co-operative called Greenwich Young People’s Theatre put on drama workshops for children. I went with a friend who, horrified at being asked to prance around pretending to be an animal, spent the evening in the lavatory. I plunged in, loved it and the next week went back alone, continuing at least once a week until I was 16.Stage Centre was on a long residential hill that snaked down to Woolwich Arsenal. The church building, its altar serving as a stage and its original stained-glass windows, wooden beams and high ceilings intact, consisted of a large vestry, two spacious workshop areas, an upstairs costume room and several anterooms used for various purposes. It was a 10-minute walk from home and, this being suburbia in the 1970s, I made the journey alone, often returning home in the dark without a care in the world. There was only one incident in all those years – a flasher who dropped his pants when I passed by on the other side of the road.The youth theatre soon became the focus of my social life. I made friends quickly and looked forward to entering its creatively stimulating environment, where I took not only drama workshops but also dabbled in photography and design. It was affordable to attend, costing literally pennies. Middle-class kids from Blackheath and Greenwich mixed with the working-class kids from Plumstead and Woolwich, such as myself, without any snobbery or isions. Outside the arty bubble of the building, it wasn’t like that at all, and I was self-conscious at being a black child in a majority white society and all that entails.At the youth theatre, we learned to think independently and imaginatively while participating collaboratively in drama activities that developed our confidence and honed our performance skills. We put on plays, had major crushes on our workshop leader Rob Tiplady, and later on John Baraldi, who arrived as a blast of energy in 1974 with his exotic Canadian accent. He took us on a magical trip to Norway in the sweltering summer of 1976. For a girl from Woolwich whose only other trip abroad was a day boat trip to France at 13, it was incredibly exciting to be performing a play in castle ruins at sunset surrounded by Scandinavian fjords.I came to love acting so much I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Rather like the writer I eventually became, I relished inhabiting characters who were not myself, expanding my own character, personality and emotions beyond the limits of my teenage identity. I found the process fascinating, absorbing and deeply rewarding. I also liked the attention, possibly because I was a middle child in a family of eight children. I learned that the arts world cherished difference, unlike my predominantly white girls’ school where everyone wore the same haircut, which I could never achieve anyway. At school, my passion for acting continued, and my friend Hilary Smith and I became the leading light of the drama group, and once appeared in a professional production of a play with pop star Sandie Shaw who played a barefoot Saint Joan, but that’s another story.After the Friday workshops, from age 13 onwards a group of us who were tall and looked older would head off to the pub and enjoy half a pint of lager and lime or a small bottle of Babycham, while sharing a single cigarette. Those were the days.After school, I studied community theatre arts at college. I learned to stand for something larger than myself, to be the change I wanted to see in the world. I co-founded Theatre of Black Women with Patricia St Hilaire and Paulette Randall when we graduated in 1982, Britain’s first such company. There was little work for us out there. It was the logical thing to do.This year I am the inaugural Woolwich laureate, reconnecting to the home town I left when I was 18, and writing about it. I recently taught a series of writing workshops at my old youth theatre, now called Tramshed and based in the tram shed that opened as an arts venue when I was a teenager. It’s still going strong as an amazing, crucially, affordable resource offering all kinds of performance activities for young people.The converted church that was Stage Centre was long ago converted into flats. It was the incubator of my early creativity, a safe space to spend my childhood. I would never have won the Booker prize last week, alongside Margaret Atwood, if the youth theatre had not nurtured what would become a lifelong career in the arts. • Bernardine Evaristo won the 2019 Booker prize for her novel Girl, Woman, Other"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00acda3e2b9cfe958f5c32949fa306157f0e5dae/0_1438_2681_1607/master/2681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b31d2f626b9e67eae287a93f0cc651ee","title":"wow factors 10 unmissable experiences in and around canadas greatest cities","story":"Get your fill of adrenalin-rush activities across Canada, with cave exploration, axe throwing and rodeos all in the mixCanada’s 10 provinces and three territories cover nearly 10m square kilometers and extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, to the Arctic Ocean – meaning there’s a whole lot of country to explore. And its cities are as erse as its landscape, with enough to keep you coming back again and again.Add a pinch of serenity to your summer city break with a sunset stand-up paddle boarding tour through the calm waterways of the Toronto Islands. Set off with your guide just before sunset on a two-hour trip that not only includes spectacular views of the Toronto harbour skyline (photo opportunity level  high), but also an adventure through hidden passageway Turtle Alley, and an optional swim in the warm, shallow waters. Oh, and don’t worry about the dark: your illuminated torch paddle will help guide you on your way.Drive your own speedboat, VancouverAye, aye, captainOne of the best ways to see the stunning coastline of Vancouver and surrounding islands is by boat – especially when it’s a private boat. Granville Island Boat Rentals, located in the heart of downtown, allows locals and tourists alike to experience the magnificent waters of the Pacific Northwest in their own speedboat – and whether you want to zip around the harbour, cruise past Stanley Park and under the Lions Gate Bridge, head in search of the Granite waterfalls, or take a trip to the resident seal colony, the water is your oyster.Party in the Royal Ontario Museum, TorontoA night out at the museumSpice up your visit to the Royal Ontario Museum by attending one of the weekly Friday Night Live events – an after-hours extravaganza that sees visitors and locals alike drinking, dancing and discovering among the incredible collection of artefacts, including dinosaur bones, mummies and more. With different themes, live music acts and DJs each week, plus plenty of food and drink, it’s a night to remember.Explore the Canmore Caves, CalgaryNot one for the claustrophobicAn hour’s drive west of Calgary lies an underground adventure, in the form of the wild and relatively untouched Rat’s Nest Cave – one of the longest caves in Canada. Guided four- and six-hour tours begin with an 18-metre rappel into the depths of the cave, before you wiggle and slide along a route that includes passages and chambers such as the Laundry Chute, Five Way Chamber, Grand Gallery, and the Grotto – the latter featuring crystal-clear pools and walls covered in stalactites and stalagmites.

Along with tours of the bison prairie, the 260-hectare (640-acre) FortWhyte Alive nature park offers a host of other activities and attractions, including a freshwater aquarium, interpretive centre, 7km of forest trails, floating marsh boardwalks, several lakes, and more. An urban oasis!The Calgary Stampede, CalgaryLive that cowboy lifeCelebrating western heritage and tradition for more than a century, this is one of Canada’s most famous events for good reason, and the 10-day festival draws more than one million global visitors looking to experience rodeo culture at the annual stampede year after year. The daily rodeo – one of the largest outdoor rodeos in the world, no less – features the likes of bareback riding, barrel racing and steer wrestling. There’s also a city-wide celebration of events and activities, including chuckwagon races, live music, parades, First Nations exhibitions and a fireworks finale.Canoe in the city, EdmontonCity exploration, the river wayWho said city exploration has to be by foot? Give those feet a break from pounding pavement and take to the gorgeous North Saskatchewan River in a canoe instead. You’ll feel like you’ve escaped the urban jungle, while still discovering all that this vibrant city has to offer – from the iconic High Level Bridge streetcar and downtown skyscrapers to the glass pyramids of the Muttart Conservatory, home to a plethora of botanical delights.

But rather than opting for 10-pin bowling or the cinema, why not try some axe throwing on for size, at the Backyard Axe Throwing League? Exactly as it sounds, the activity involves hurling hatchets at a target similar to those used in archery, and it’s harder than the plaid-clad staff make it look. You get your own private space for throwing and work off some serious stress while having a good time.Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, HalifaxDiscover Canada’s originsUncover some history at the Canadian equivalent of Ellis Island – Pier 21 – which was the gateway for more than 1 million immigrants entering the country between 1928 and 1971. The Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 now marks the historic spot, showcasing the compelling stories of those who left their homelands behind to start a new life in North America. Permanent and visiting exhibitions featuring first-hand testimonies and artefacts make for a fascinating visit, while there are also interactive elements such as a period costume dress-up box and Customs Challenge.Cross-country skiing, TorontoThere’s no business like snow businessMix up your city break with some outside entertainment, in the form of cross-country skiing, or snowshoeing. There’s no shortage of options in and around the city for some winter exploration, including the Toronto Islands, which have a network of beautiful and expansive trails that keep people coming back year after year.

Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

But his greatest victory, he says, was securing the lead in David Chase’s big screen Sopranos prequel‘I would say a good percentage of the roles I’ve done have only come to me after somebody dropped out at the last minute,” says Alessandro Nivola. I assume he is being self-deprecating, but he assures me he is being honest. He is in London to talk about The Art of Self-Defense, a black comedy that holds toxic masculinity in its satirical crosshairs. “This one, I’m sure somebody did drop out because I was offered it a week before it started.”At 47, Nivola is in the midst of a particularly fruitful period of his career. He has been a working actor since he left Yale in the mid-90s, but the last few years have taken him to a new level. There was Selma, You Were Never Really Here and a remarkable turn in Disobedience. On television, he co-starred with Robert De Niro in the Bernie Madoff film The Wizard of Lies and played Lee Berger in Channel 4’s adaptation of Chimerica.If, as he says, he is usually the second choice, how is that for his ego? “I couldn’t give a shit, really. If I think it’s a great job, I’m only too happy that the other idiot decided he had better things to do.”Nivola is an excellent and effusive storyteller. In The Art of Self-Defense, Jesse Eisenberg plays Casey, a loner who is beaten up by a gang and takes refuge in a karate class run by Nivola’s absurdly macho, ultra-violent Sensei. “I had just put my bags down in the hotel room and there was this loud knock on my door,” Nivola says, of his last-minute arrival on the project. “I opened it up and this very strong woman just pushed me out of the way and marched into my room – and announced that she was there to make me a black belt in 24 hours.”He didn’t quite become a black belt, but it didn’t matter. “I mean, look, it was all for comic effect, the stuff that I had to do.” For a long time, the audience is not quite sure who or what Sensei is. “But I felt like the more convincing I could be, the more this particular deadpan style of humour would work. You’re not sure if you’re supposed to laugh or be horrified or both at the same time.”Nivola brings the conversation back to The Sopranos film at every turn. He loves to research a role, and The Many Saints of Newark, which begins in 1967 and moves through the early 70s, provided a banquet of opportunity. “A friend’s friend was a priest in Newark. He had grown up in that neighbourhood and introduced me to all kinds of people there. You know, the connection between the mob and the church is notorious,” he says, laughing.He starts to talk about the famous Newark mob boss, Richie “The Boot” Boiardo. “I think Coppola may have based some of Marlon Brando’s character in The Godfather on this guy,” he explains. The priest took Nivola to one of the Catholic churches that had been built by Italian immigrants. “He showed me this incredible stained glass window and said, ‘Go and look up close.’“I looked and it says, ‘Gift of Mr and Mrs Ruggiero Boiardo’.” He beams. “That’s Richie the Boot!”He flicks through photos on his phone. “The weirdest thing happened,” he begins. “The day I got offered this job, my brother sent me this screenshot from an episode of The Sopranos where Tony is in Naples, and he’s in these underground catacombs. In the back of this photo was this sculpture. And this sculpture turns out to be made by my grandfather.”Nivola’s grandfather was the sculptor Costantino Nivola, and there had been a travelling exhibition of his work when The Sopranos happened to be shooting in Naples. “I told David after they’d offered me the job and he just couldn’t believe it. He thought it was ine intervention or something.”Nivola also met some real-life mobsters. “Oh, yeah,” he says. “I mean, I don’t have any dirt on anybody, but I had the opportunity to talk to somebody who introduced me to somebody else, who introduced me to somebody else and, finally, I was sitting at a table with a bunch of guys who really were living this life. Trying to determine whether these guys are imitating the movies or the movies are imitating them is such a tricky thing.”In fact, the person who made the introduction told him not to mention The Sopranos because he was worried they would start to play to type. “They just thought I was a friend of his. But if those real guys had been in a movie, you would have thought it was a send-up of a mob movie.”I ask about James Gandolfini’s son, Michael, playing the young Tony Soprano, but Nivola starts to worry about how much he can say. “I just don’t want David to kill me,” he reasons. “I can maybe give you a little bit of a feel for it. Dickie was a kind of mentor figure to Tony as a young guy. I think Tony and everyone else in that neighbourhood saw this guy as a perfect man and the story of this movie really reveals otherwise.”There are “big Greek themes running through it”, and it is set against the backdrop of the late-60s race riots. “It’s a big part of the fabric of the story, the relations between the Italian-American community and the black community in Newark at that time. The main thing is that this character is, like all of David’s heroes, incredibly complex, morally complex, and just full of kind of every colour that you could imagine.” He sighs happily. “It was something I could have spent years working on.”Now he is thinking about what comes next. He is working on a film with Ethan Hawke, about the fractious relationship between the 1950s vocal duo, the Louvin Brothers. Phil Morrison, who directed Nivola in Junebug, is in line to direct. From an outside perspective, it looks as if his career is the best it has ever been. “Yeah,” he nods, smiling. Then he turns back to The Sopranos once again. “I had been feeling over these past several years that something was brewing, but I never could have guessed that whatever the thing was would be as great as that.”The Art of Self-Defense is released on download on 4 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae38aff1db63801a7f6a6c8df065174bfed035a/803_0_2520_1513/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14443b485f4f782b62be2c53f64db6ef","title":"countdown review halloween horror final destination","story":"Final Destination gets an unofficial smartphone reboot in a lazy and entirely unscary slab of schlock focused on an app that predicts your time of deathJust two weeks after audiences and critics shut down evil Siri comedy Jexi, the smartphone is back causing more trouble on the big screen in glitchy schlock horror Countdown, a Halloween release devoid of tricks, treats and anything even vaguely close to an original idea.With a plot that cribs from a great deal of other, better horror films, Countdown ultimately owes a staggering debt to 2000’s ferociously effective franchise starter Final Destination (in fact, the scariest thing about the entire endeavour could very well be a lawsuit directed at those involved). Almost two decades later, the conceit has been given a tech upgrade with an app that, once downloaded, will tell the user how long they have to live. After nurse Quinn (You’s Elizabeth Lail) is met with a patient who warns her of the app’s IRL consequences, she irrationally decides to download it, only to be informed that she has just three days left. Initially ignoring the app as a nasty prank, she’s soon plagued with visions, and starts to realise that the clock really is ticking.As dim on screen as it sounds on paper, Countdown is a wildly ineffective waste of a release date, a film out six days before Halloween yet likely to be forgotten within six hours. Given the endless influx of sub-par wide-releasing horror films, expectations should never be too high for one that might prove at least mildly entertaining, but there’s really no excuse for them to be this bad. Combining elements of Final Destination with Ring, Countdown manages to inelegantly avoid everything about those two films that made them so successful. One of the many terrifying elements of Final Destination was the decision not to personify death (an early iteration of the script actually did turn the grim reaper into a visible character). There was something so chilling about an unseen force constructing inescapable scenarios for those whose numbers were up, and the film revelled in making them as surprising and sadistic as possible. In Countdown, we get a cloaked demon so shoddily brought to life he’d be laughed out of a Halloween party, and with the film’s PG-13 rating, death is quick, merciful and awkwardly edited to appease the censors.While Ring sent its heroine on a compelling journey to find out the source of the film’s terror, with a plot that worked independently as a mystery, Countdown pairs Lail with Riverdale’s Jordan Calloway and lumbers them with an uninvolving and incoherent scramble from a phone repair shop all the way to a church. The specifics of the plot aren’t that specific, and the film isn’t able to back up its erting premise with much of an explanation, although in trying to do so, by going back through history, there is some unintentional hilarity (at one point, someone says “This app seems like a new version of what that old gypsy lady did!”).It’s a brief 90 minutes – but even that requires writer-director Justin Dec to pad the film out. The majority of characters who download the app are informed they have years to live, and so the film’s pool of victims is miniscule, and therefore death scenes are few and far between. To fill time, Dec decides to employ a misjudged #MeToo subplot involving a doctor at the hospital where Lail’s character works, played with extra ham by Peter Facinelli. Regrettably, the setting also finds space for an underused Tichina Arnold, so great in little-seen TV comedy Survivor’s Remorse and briefly this year in The Last Black Man in San Francisco. Lail is a cog within an engine and her character bears no characteristics other than “nurse”, while Calloway does manage to inject some charm into yet another thankless role.Even on its own very, very basic terms, there are just too many scenes where characters act with utterly illogical idiocy, especially in the final act. Rather than screaming for them to go the other way, you’ll be urging them to accept fate and die instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db5a0a77cbcee34caad8463d3810013ddbce60f/0_96_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15738fd3fa47c3c47af6cdf860c657ca","title":"on the road dennis hoppers 60s photography in pictures","story":"The Easy Rider actor-director picked up a camera in 1961 and began a parallel career as a photographer, taking shots on film sets, in diners and out in the landscape, before putting all of his pictures in a vault in the early 70s.

And that’s not to mention the rise of ‘hard coffee’It’s annoying when a meme arrives in your life before the product it is meming about is available in the country you live in. It is as though there is an inferior broadband connection on your material reality. I know, just from an ambient awareness of the US comedian Trevor Wallace – who gave birth to the meme “drinks White Claw once” – that the drink White Claw is very popular in the US. I also know – from the same source – that “there ain’t no laws when you’re drinking claws”. Yet I could only source a White Claw from the US. If you went into a pub asking for a “spiked seltzer”, they would most probably just get a soda water and put some vodka in it, at least if they had any initiative.Across a spectrum of zingy flavours – lime, grapefruit, cherry – White Claw is, as you may have guessed, a fizzy drink with booze in it. You can’t really taste the booze because your brain just shovels it into the category of fruity carbonation. I like it because it reminds me of my dad, who would put alcohol in just about anything: whisky in tea vodka in chocolate milk one time, with limited options in a car (not driving, I hope, although that would be a very my dad thing to do), he mixed grappa with Benylin to create a cocktail known as the “coughtail”. White Claw, incidentally, shot to prominence so quickly that it found itself inserted into the culture wars: what was later discovered to be a hoax account on Twitter published an image that appeared to show the White Claw account supporting Blue Lives Matter, a pro-police countermovement to Black Lives Matter. White Claw had nothing to do with it, and so the attempt to cancel the brand was diffused.You will be wondering how this differs from the alcopops of the 90s, violently coloured neon drinks that attracted peculiar amounts of moral opprobrium, back in the day when we didn’t have more important things to get puffed up about. The Co-op banned sales of alcopops in June 1997: five weeks after the Labour landslide, when things could only get better, when Britannia was finally cool, people were so worried about children getting hooked on alcohol because it was turquoise that there were supermarket wars over who was the most socially responsible, mediated through Hooch and Two Dogs lemonade. The arrival of alcohol-spiked milks Moo and Super Milch that year was also taken as a tilt towards the youth market, although presumably they weren’t intended for the classic milk consumer, the baby. One slightly half-hearted corporate defence at the time was that alcopops were intended for women, who wanted to drink without smelling of alcohol. I feel sure I heard someone on the radio use the word “housewife”.In the US during the same period, Zima was the alcopop, and even though it was marketed obsessively to men, only women drank it, hence “bitch beer”. There’s a lot of raw misogyny in the spiked-soft-drink culture.Anyway, with autumn upon us, enter canned “hard coffee”: a generic alcohol base mixed with cold brew or coffee extract, milk and sugar. Is it dangerous, concerned citizens ask, remembering their Red Bull-and-vodka disasters of last century? Not really, reply other citizens, who have been drinking irish coffee and espresso martinis since before Starbucks existed (yes, really). In case of category confusion, bear in mind: this is not a morning drink. There is no such thing as a morning drink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d114e92b86afd9a86a50e97f69b26724eb58a7da/0_1318_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c617350b2c21ce79bb3722ca17c643d","title":"not just for carving chefs on the twelve most delicious ways to cook pumpkin","story":"From chowders to sourdough, restaurateurs and cooks explain how to get the best from the orange gourdsThe statistics on Halloween food waste are suitably frightening. More than 8m pumpkins are expected to be binned uneaten this year, acccording to research by stock cube makers Knorr and the food-waste charity Hubbub. That’s more than 18,000 tonnes of edible flesh. Most of us do not even consider pumpkins food.That misunderstanding has been compounded by carving pumpkins occasionally being labelled “for ornamental use only”. But that is changing: Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, for example, do not use such labelling all of their carving pumpkins are edible.It can be hard work to hollow out these thin-walled but robust monsters, discard the toughest fibrous bits, separate the seeds and create something tasty from the watery flesh. But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin. Here are some ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers.The wet flesh in bigger pumpkins lends itself to pie fillings. Roast chunks with lots of garlic until caramelised and toss it in a blitzed dressing of sage, lemon zest and oil. Line a bread tin with shortcrust pastry (at home, I use all-butter Jus-Rol) and pack the mix in. After cooking – 45 minutes at 210C (190C fan)410Fgas mark 7 – the filling will still be juicy and the pastry perfect – and you get that mosaic effect of the dressing and its flavours running around the chunks and right through the pie. Calum Franklin, executive chef, Holborn Dining Rooms, LondonHalloween pumpkins can be watery, so once you’ve cooked the flesh, hang it in a colander overnight to get rid of as much liquid as possible. You want intense flavour. These tortelli come from Lombardy and they are basically pumpkin mixed with mostarda (mustard oil and fruit preserve) and parmesan, stuffed into pasta and served with sage butter. It isn’t measured exactly it’s down to taste. Puree the mixture if you like, too. I would recommend people make fresh pasta for this. Roll it out thinly in one long strip, dot your pumpkin mix on, fold it over, seal it, cut it – I use a square shape – and you have lovely tortelli. Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, LondonWhen you add roasted, liquidised pumpkin to sourdough (200g to 1kg of flour reduce the water slightly), you get a gorgeous loaf. It imparts a natural earthy flavour, as well as making the crumb noticeably softer. And you get a crisper crust. After removing any fibrous material around the seeds, gently dry them in a low oven and roast them with salt and olive oil – you can put them in the bread, too. The key thing to know when adding seeds is that they suck moisture from bread. Immediately after roasting them, pour a little water over the seeds and they will absorb it. You will get all the toasted flavour, but no dry seeds. Aidan Monks, owner-baker, Lovingly Artisan, CumbriaTechnically, because it contains seeds, pumpkin is a fruit – so why not treat it as one? Finely chop the flesh, add a little water and a handful of brown sugar and let it bubble until pulpy. Blitz with a hand blender, put it back on the stove and cook it until it is thick and spitting. Let it cool and thicken and there you go: pumpkin jam. It’s sweet, so stick it on dark rye sourdough. It needs that bitterness. Andrew Dargue, chef-owner, Vanilla Black, LondonLocro de zapallo is a classic Peruvian, originally Andean, dish, usually served with white rice. The quick, easy version is: sauté sliced onions, garlic and red chilli in olive oil, add pumpkin (250g per person, roughly cubed) and vegetable stock, and cook until the pumpkin breaks down but still retains some chunks. To finish, add cooked broad beans, tons of chopped parsley and a dash of cumin. It should be a vibrantly orange, garlicky, thick, sloppy stew, fresh with parsley. This is vegan but, if you want, add cream and crumbled feta. Martin Morales, chef-owner, Ceviche restaurants, LondonIdeally, choose a smaller, sweeter pumpkin for this tasty, simple Valencian dessert. Cover the pumpkin with foil and bake for about an hour at 190C (170C fan)gas mark 5. In a sieve, press out as much water as possible and then mash it until smooth. To make four portions, mix 400g of pumpkin with 50g ground almonds, 60g sugar, one egg yolk, half a teaspoon of cinnamon and lemon zest. Spoon it into inidual ramekins, top with blanched almonds and honey and bake until golden. We serve it with homemade turrón ice cream. Joe Wright, chef-owner, Porta, ChesterA light, vegan hug-in-a-bowl for autumn. Sauté onion, minced garlic and charred sweetcorn with four tablespoons of olive oil. Add a tablespoon of plain or gluten-free flour, followed by cubes of pumpkin – you can use any, from fibrous Halloween types to our favourite acorn squash. Then, adding veg stock slowly, cook until it is just soft. Finish with seasoning, chopped flat-leaf parsley and roasted pumpkin seeds. Samantha Evans, chef-owner, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry, WalesDry-fried pumpkin seeds – keep them moving in the pan so they don’t burn – are great in adventurous salads. They work especially well as a nutty complement to sweet-sour pops of fresh fruit. One of my favourites is our take on chana chaat. This sees toasted pumpkin seeds, couscous, chickpeas, raisins, a little fresh tomato and pomegranate seeds tossed together, seasoned and drizzled with coriander-mint dressing, made by blitzing fresh coriander, toasted coriander seeds, mint, sugar, pickled chillies, sunflower seeds, turmeric and lime juice. Naved Nasir, executive chef, DishoomThis pre-Hiic Mexican recipe uses pumpkin seeds, with the red coming from charred tomatoes and dried guajillo chilli. Roast 800g of tomatoes, 500g of onions and peeled garlic, turning occasionally. Toast 25g of chillies for about 30 seconds, then soften them in boiling water. In a blender, process all the ingredients and 380g of toasted pumpkin seeds until smooth. Pass the salsa through a strainer, season and serve with the roasted chicken or pumpkin. It’s a kiss of spiciness – but not overpowering. Martha Ortiz, chef-patron, Ella Canta, LondonThis is my take on a pumpkin spiced latte. To make six, put half a tablespoon of coffee granules in 300ml of milk – granules work best to get that proper coffee taste – and heat until infused. Then add 360ml of cooked pumpkin puree, 420ml of double cream, 120ml of caster sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix it together and bring it almost to the boil. Off the heat, add three sheets of pre-soaked bronze leaf gelatine. Whisk thoroughly and sieve it. Pour into moulds and allow six hours to set.

After a lacklustre first season, he joined England for their disastrous 2016 Euro campaign which saw them knocked out by Iceland in the last 16.A disappointing first year followed by a disastrous summer. Enter Pep. City’s football director, Txiki Begiristain, had signed Sterling specifically in anticipation of Pep taking over.“He had a spark, a capacity to shake off markers. He’s explosive and above all he’s got that burst of pace which takes effective wide players to the goalline. Even then, it was also clear that he was a guy who loved to cut in, too.”Begiristain’s football instincts were correct. Under the guidance of Pep and his team, Sterling has become a truly world-class player. In his first season under Manuel Pellegrini, Sterling managed only six league goals and by the second half of the campaign had lost his place as a regular starter.“The huge transfer fee was actually pretty detrimental in terms of his self-confidence, which is so important for any player. As things didn’t come off for him you could almost see Raz fading away,” explains Mikel Arteta, who was still playing for Arsenal at the time. The following year, Arteta joined Pep and Domènec Torrent at City and he began to work closely with Sterling.“We wanted him much closer to the penalty area. It was like he was a bit scared of the goal. We wanted him to become the kind of player who would get us a goal every game, or even just missing two or three big chances. We wanted him constantly generating goal threat. And we wanted him to lose the fear. He needed to believe in himself, to believe that he could be the best.”The new regime had an almost immediate impact. Suddenly his head was up, he was running more than ever and, by Pep’s second season, had formed one of the most lethal attacking forces in the history of the Premier League with Leroy Sané and Sergio Agüero, between them scoring 67 of the team’s total of 140 goals.First, however, the coaching team had to realign Sterling for his role on the right of Guardiola’s trident. Mikel Arteta: “He’d picked up a few bad habits along the way. He’d played on the inside a lot or out on the left wing. When you move to the right wing, the direction and angle of possession coming to you is very different. When the ball reached him he really had his gaze fixed on it – rather than half-touch instinctive control and the vision of what’s around him.”Sterling was static when he got the ball. Guardiola’s solution was to try to turn him into City’s version of Romário, the coach’s old Barcelona teammate and a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994.Pep Guardiola: “In that Dream Team era, whenever I saw Romário with his back to the centre-halves I’d never give him the ball. But the instant I saw him on the half-turn with his shoulder dipping as if he wanted the ball fed into his right or left foot, I knew he thought he could explode away from his marker. In that instance I always hit the pass immediately. Every time. I’d learned that his vision meant he’d had one eye on the distance between him and the opposition goal and the other eye on where the ball was. If he opened up his body shape like that and I fed him the ball, the defender was automatically done for.”The key to this strategy was Sterling’s acceleration. Guardiola’s analysis staff compare their forward’s explosive first steps to those of Leo Messi. While the Barcelona player doesn’t possess a sprinter’s speed over distance, his acceleration – combined with an intuitive sense of when to make his move – leaves defenders in his wake. Thus began the Romário-fication of Raheem.The plan was that Sterling should make a habit of dropping slightly further away from his marker, or nearest opponent, when looking to receive possession, his body turned towards the goal. In that position, if he then gunned his extraordinary accelerator, the sprint was always to the danger area. Arteta: “If he’s found a space about three metres off his defender but he’s half-turned towards the goal then his sprint takes him much more quickly to a space where he can shoot and that’s going to cause the rival much more damage. It’s also a tactic, dropping off a little, so that your defender gets drawn into a position he mightn’t want to be in. It leaves space behind him and Raheem can attack that space. If it’s close to, or in the penalty area, they also have to hesitate before putting in a challenge.”Arteta is drawing on facts with his assessment. For example, in the 1-0 Champions League victory over Feyenoord in November 2017, Sterling pulled all of this together. He dropped off at the edge of the box, drawing his defender, Renato Tapia, with him and, with his back to goal, shunted a quick pass backwards to Gundogan. The instant he released the ball, he swivelled and burst into one of his 0-60 sprints, into the space where Tapia had been. Gundogan read the move, slid the one-two pass into that space. One-v-one with the keeper, Sterling lofted it over Brad Jones for City’s winning goal.Sterling played increasingly on the left wing in season 2018-19, although Guardiola continued to move him around a lot. His partnership with Bernardo Silva went from strength to strength, meaning that Sané figured much less in the starting XI. The PFA Young Player of the Year won by Sané in 2018 went to Sterling in 2019, after he finished the season with a personal best of 25 goals and 18 assists from 51 games. By November 2018 City had seen enough to extend Sterling’s contract through season 2022-23.Yet Guardiola continues to see room for improvement. Take the coach’s critique of him after the home game against Watford on 9 March 2019, in which he had scored a hat-trick by the 64th minute. “Sterling could do better. He didn’t follow his full-back two times. He lost two, three or four balls which he has to avoid because he conceded counterattacks. Of course, I am so glad in terms of what he has done, scoring three goals. The first half was not the best Raheem has done this season and we will work on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19dfbdccdb56b51d673a4be23b5146b77c97f389/0_25_3750_2251/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c16e9bcb58ff812a0fd5806218d050e0","title":"stop and search up by almost a third in england and wales","story":"Police use tactic 370,454 times in year to March – up from 279,728 in previous 12 monthsIn the 12 months to March 2019 there were 370,454 stop and searches conducted by forces under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace), up from 279,728 in the previous 12 months.White people made up the largest ethnicity group searched under police powers, at 187,761, followed by black people, who were stopped 70,648 times. However, black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people were still over four times more likely to be stopped than white people.For those who identified as black or black British, the disparity was even greater – they were 9.7 times more likely to be stopped and searched by an officer than a white person.After the Home Office rolled back restrictions to the controversial tactic in August as part of an attempt to curb knife crime, an equality impact assessment warned that more people from BAME backgrounds were likely to be targeted despite not having committed crimes.The government report also warned that relaxed conditions could create “broader issues” among the public in terms of their trust in the police.Under the act, an officer can remove someone suffering from mental ill health from a public place to a place of safety if in their judgment the person requires immediate care or control in the interests of their safety or others.A further 13,175 stop and searches were carried out under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act in anticipation of violence – more than five times the number of searches made under this power the year before.In March this year Sajid Javid, the then home secretary, enhanced section 60 powers, giving police officers more scope to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion.The move came after official statistics showed fatal stabbings were at their highest level since records began.Then in August, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the current home secretary, Priti Patel, loosened restrictions on the use of the tactic even further.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said the time had arrived to “come down hard on crime”, while Patel told the Sun on Sunday she would ensure police had “the resources and the powers they need” to protect people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa85a6dad91f58c952bcb88e1c03914075cecc4/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c56663c5dc1ea3c230289af213759967","title":"guess which royal story excites myopic media","story":"Jeffrey Epstein continues to cast his shadow over Prince Andrew, but somehow it’s Meghan’s choice of decor that gets the press in a frothWill it all just end up going away for Prince Andrew? You’d be mad to rule it out. On Monday night, Channel 4’s Dispatches broadcast a programme that aired claims by Virginia Roberts Giuffre – who alleges she was kept as Jeffrey Epstein’s sex slave while a minor and beyond – that she had been required to have sex with Epstein’s friend Andrew three times. Once was in London, she alleged, shortly after the infamous picture was taken of Andrew with his arm round the waist of the 17-year-old Roberts Giuffre. Once was in New York, she also claimed, and once was in an orgy with other young women on the billionaire financier’s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as “Paedophile Island”.Prince Andrew absolutely denies all these accusations, which were struck from Florida court records in 2015, having recently said he was “appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes”. Even though he continued to be friends with Epstein after the latter had served more than a year in prison for procuring an underage girl for prostitution. Only a discredited plea deal prevented multiple further accusers, whose existence was publicly known, from being part of the case.So, yes, Dispatches was Monday night. On Tuesday, the Duke of York was unusually accompanied on a formal engagement by his eldest daughter Beatrice, who is not a working member of the royal family, having a separate career. She is to be married next year, as her sister Princess Eugenie was last October. The taxpayer dropped a couple of million on security for the latter event at Windsor, with the local council stumping up a further undisclosed sum for services such as stewarding and parking facilities. Eugenie’s wedding was televised on ITV, although it remains to be seen whether the family will decide that it’s worth going down that route again. Perhaps it depends where the whole investigation-into-Andrew’s-dead-underage-sex-trafficker-friend thing is at that particular moment.Either way, there is some speculation that her father feels the need of the protective charm of family members at this time. Certainly, anonymous friends have been working hard on his behalf for a couple of months. These friends began by addressing the aforementioned photo of Andrew with Roberts Giuffre, his hand resting on the teenager’s bare hip as the duke and Epstein’s mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell smile away. According to these “sources close to the duke”, the picture may be a fake, because Prince Andrew has “much chubbier” fingers.If you’ve never heard such rubbish, you will likely boggle even more at the close sources’ more recent tack. Namely, that Andrew only flew to stay with Epstein in New York in 2010 in order to tell him they could no longer be friends. This was the same trip that took place after Epstein had been released from an 18-month jail sentence. This was the same trip where he and Andrew were photographed strolling and chatting together in Central Park, and where Andrew was photographed and filmed grinningly answering the door of Epstein’s mansion to a young woman. Was this the same trip where literary agent John Brockman reported being in the same room as Andrew and Epstein as they received simultaneous foot massages from two young, attractive Russian women? It’s not clear. Even without that, though, you have to think it’s EXACTLY how you too would end a friendship with a Tier-1 sex offender who you knew had recently got out of jail.Then again, for all the radioactive horror of the Epstein story, the bizarre reality is that Andrew barely needs to bother coming up with weird or absurd explanations that keep making it worse. Because, once more, people are looking in quite another direction. Despite airing a full 24 hours later, the Dispatches details were almost entirely drowned in the continuing tide of media coverage of the documentary the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had participated in the night previously, in which they spoke of their struggle to deal with their media coverage.Given the sheer volume of stuff already punditted about this, I won’t add much to the pile. Personally, I’d resign from being sixth in line to the throne or whatever Harry is, and do one to Hollywood, where Meghan can be the biggest movie star in the world for her 40s, and he can be wheeled shyly out at her premieres, like Hugh Grant at the end of Notting Hill. But I’m willing to accept it might be more complicated than that.Ultimately, though, we should be more interested in what happened to the courage, moral and otherwise, of those who continue to regard the decor of their baby’s nursery or whatever as a bigger story than persistent allegations of Andrew’s relationship with Epstein, which has been very far from satisfactorily resolved.Alas, there does come a point where we have to consider what kind of hive mind reckons the one story is so much more worthwhile than the other, despite the obvious misery of Harry and Meghan and the enduring misery of the likes of Roberts Giuffre. As part of this column’s tireless – tireless! – commitment to public service journalism, this feels like the time to psychologically profile the most dedicated and virulent Meghan-haters, who somehow haven’t a word to say about Prince Andrew’s extensive links to a massive, raging, paedophile sex-case. To wit: GUYS, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? DON’T LOOK THERE! LOOK OVER HERE INSTEAD!Listen, no one’s saying that you’re a paedo if you have spent at least 30 times more broadcast energycolumn inches on condemning Meghan for such things as etiquette infractions in the royal box at Wimbledon than you have on Prince Andrew being repeatedly linked to a huge international underage sex-trafficking scandal involving his deceased close friend Jeffrey Epstein (denied, as above).Or wait – am I saying that? Of course not! Well, pretty sure. But seriously: if that’s you, you DO have a problem. And you DO have to go on a kind of register that I am compiling, with the working title “The Meghan Offenders Register”. Don’t worry, I’ll sign it for you. At present, you don’t have to go door-to-door in your neighbourhood and tell people who you are. Namely, a person who has tipped all over a new mother for relatively minuscule things, while not really thinking Prince Andrew being accused of being embroiled in something so much bigger is worth your timeword count.As I say: at present, you don’t have to go house-to-house. Ultimately, though, we kind of know what you are. And that thing is pretty hideous. Something has gone very badly wrong. And listen, I’m a liberal. If it were up to me, society would set aside a lot more money for research into how people like you get to be people like you. You could then be helped via state-of-the-art treatment programmes, because, in a lot of ways, it is a mental deficiency. Unfortunately, people are so grossed out and incensed by how you are that they don’t want to rationally deal with the problem, put money into it and begin the difficult work of trying to fix you for the greater good. So, yeah, it’s a cycle. Others will offend because of you.In conclusion, then, what follows can only be a cut-price care plan. But here goes: every time you hear Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now a mother of three herself, telling her story, but decide there’s something about it that makes her not worth listening to … please try to chemically castrate those thoughts. Please don’t act on your perverse urges to attack Meghan and Harry instead for things that just aren’t that big of a deal. And once more, please, in the name of basic decency: DON’T LOOK THERE! LOOK OVER HERE INSTEAD!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019a761714c550ee7d1cacc9e2742a4994b18d01/1147_308_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389ed8c5f1174389698302f4f73756cf","title":"john humphrys returns to radio classic fm","story":"Ex-Today presenter takes temporary role filling in on Classic FM breakfast showWhen he retired from Radio 4’s Today programme last month, John Humphrys might have been expected to take the opportunity to have a lie-in after 32 years of early morning starts.Instead, he has already announced his return to the radio with a stint filling in as host of Classic FM’s breakfast show, swapping heated interviews with leading politicians for a job introducing pieces of calming classical music.Humphrys will present the programme for a week from Monday 28 October between 6am and 9am, filling in for usual presenter Tim Lihoreau.He said: “I’m struggling to think of a greater contrast with my old job: the bliss of Beethoven and Brahms instead of Brexit and backstops!

Behind the surge in saving is auto-enrolment, the scheme set up by the government in 2012 to make sure everyone, whether they work for a supermarket or a corner shop, has a private pension to add to their state pension.In its first year, around 1 million workers from big companies were brought into the scheme, and there were fears that as smaller workplaces were drawn into the net, more and more people would opt out.But the pensions regulator said the numbers enrolled rose to 6.2 million in 2016 and had now hit 10 million.Critics had warned that forcing small employers such as hairdressing salons to offer a pension would create unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy. But the Pensions Regulator said that between 2016 and 2018 there was a surge in small and “micro” employers joining the scheme, with 1.5 million employers now fully enrolled.There is one group that has been left in the cold by auto-enrolment – the self-employed, who are not required to join the scheme, and whose numbers have increased sharply in recent years.Tom Selby, a pensions expert at AJ Bell, said: “While the government is justified to some extent in lauding the success of automatic enrolment, the reforms are by no means a silver bullet to solve the UK’s retirement problems.“The fact over 10 million people, many of whom are young and women, have been automatically enrolled into a pension since 2012 is to be celebrated, but average contributions remain painfully low.”However, Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, cautioned against pushing up contribution rates too soon. “Politicians shouldn’t rush to ratchet up the minimum contributions. The current auto-enrolment rates are a good starting point and given other pressing financial concerns, such as problem debt and lack of cash reserves for many households, a rush to mandate higher pension savings rates now could be damaging to household financial resilience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345d31e6d55e053c7a0ac376576cbeed4b4417ef/0_0_5201_3120/master/5201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f512f8b03b026eaf10f08121c95a70e2","title":"martin scorsese on lou reed he spoke the language of people with nothing","story":"The director hails a songwriter who, like him, brought the wild side of New York to life, recalls the collaborations that got away, and tells what it’s like to be immortalised in one of his songsI met Lou Reed for the first time at the restaurant at L’Ermitage Hotel in LA. I was a great admirer of his solo work, Street Hassle in particular (I came later to the Velvet Underground), so I went over and introduced myself. I was in Los Angeles working on the post-production of Raging Bull and I invited Lou to join us as we played back the final mix, the only time we actually screened the film on the west coast. When the lights came up, he seemed fairly overwhelmed. I remember that he was even impressed with the use of music, from Mascagni to Louis Prima.After the screening, I happened to mention to Lou that I wanted to make a film out of a short story called In Dreams Begin Responsibilities by Delmore Schwartz, which I had read the year before when Bob De Niro and I were working on the script. I was amazed when he told me that he’d been a student of Schwartz’s at Syracuse University, and he was just as amazed that I knew this autobiographical story by his mentor, the man who gave him a foundation in poetry, and that it had resonated so deeply for me. Later, I thought about adapting In Dreams for my contribution to New York Stories. I’d still like to make that film one day.Lou’s lyrics have two lives: as they are sung and heard, and as they are read on the printed page. And I think that they could only have come from someone who grew up in the New York area and came of age in Manhattan, who moved and wrote and sang from the pulse of life in this city. They describe the city as it was but they also incarnate it. You feel it in the rhythms (for instance, the driving rhythm of Street Hassle set by the string section, or the propulsive guitars on the live version of Sweet Jane, to name two favourites), you feel it in Lou’s voice, and you feel it in those words – really, they’re all one and the same. It’s essential New York speech, and it feels so close to what I was always trying to do in my own pictures, in the way the characters speak to each other and express themselves. You read or listen to the words and you see those people, hanging out or waiting or hustling on street corners or talking in tenement halls or going out on the boulevard.Take this section of Street Hassle, about a woman who’s OD’d and the hustler she picked up who’s stuck trying to get rid of her body:You know, some people got no choice And they can never find a voice To talk with that they can even call their own So the first thing they seeThat allows them the right to beWhy they follow it, you know, it’s called bad luck.Lou and I got to know each other over the years. I was so touched when he wrote a song about me and Sam Shepard on his 1984 album New Sensations – actually, it was about our work and how much it meant to him. In 1987, he auditioned for the role of Pontius Pilate in my film The Last Temptation of Christ, but his old friend David Bowie ended up playing the part. In the 90s, we tried to get a film made based on Dirty Boulevard from Lou’s album New York, from a script by Reinaldo Povod, who had written a play called Cuba and His Teddy Bear with Bob De Niro and who later passed away at a very young age. We were never able to get that picture into production.When I got the news that Lou had died, I was absolutely shocked. We had lost touch and I had no idea that he had been so sick. He was a great singer, a great writer, a great New York artist … a great artist, period. He actually spoke and sang in the voice of the lowest of the low, the dregs, the “least among us” – the people looking to follow the first thing that gives them the right to be. He spoke the language of people with nothing but their own humanity, and he elevated them. His words and his music – sometimes as close to everyday life as breathing – inspired many, many people over the years. I’m one of them.Taken from an updated edition of I’ll Be Your Mirror by Lou Reed, published 7 November by Faber."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67aa1933545e3bd6716428c0ab6927642e6ead7/0_25_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e082e1e8535e85c187033c889e86683e","title":"neil young and crazy horse colorado album review","story":"(Reprise)Deeply personal ballads and the incredible potency of his band elevate Young’s 39th album above his painfully on-the-nose political messagingIt’s hard to know where to level your expectations of Neil Young’s 39th album. On the one hand, it’s a long time since Young made a genuinely great album of original material – the Daniel Lanois-produced Le Noise, which came out nearly a decade ago – and longer still since he managed to reach anything like the skyscraping artistic heights he attained as a matter of course in the 1970s: the charts are full of people who weren’t even born when Sleeps With Angels was released in 1994.On the other hand, Colorado is an album recorded amid personal turmoil – his ex-wife Pegi died of cancer in January Elliot Roberts, his manager and co-conspirator for half a century, passed away in June – and, unfortunately for him, Young has a tendency to make his best albums amid personal turmoil and loss: On the Beach, Tonight’s the Night, Sleeps With Angels, even Le Noise, which was haunted by the loss of longtime collaborators Ben Keith and Larry Johnson.Then again, Colorado arrives with an accompanying film, Mountaintop, and there are few phrases more likely to sink the spirits of the long-term Young fan than “Neil’s made another film”. Young has persisted in making films since the early 70s without ever getting any better at it his filmography is a now-bulging file of evidence to suggest he should step away from the director’s chair for the good of humanity. As it turns out, Mountaintop is merely boring, rather than excruciating: anyone who wants to spend 90 minutes watching Neil Young arguing about the volume of his amplifier and inhaling oxygen to combat the altitude of the Colorado studio where he’s recording is in for a treat, but better that than one of his arthouse films, which can leave you wondering if the more repressive Middle East theocracies didn’t have a point when it came to banning cinema altogether.The album itself, meanwhile, reunites Young with Crazy Horse, his most dependable backing band. Like Young’s film-making, Crazy Horse have somehow contrived to get no better at all over 50 years. Unlike Young’s film-making, they didn’t need to improve: from the moment they lumbered into view, horrifying Young’s peers with their rudimentary abilities, Crazy Horse sounded amazing, like some hulking, rusty bit of farm machinery that barely works but somehow generates incredible power. You can hear it on Colorado’s centrepiece, She Showed Me Love: there’s an astonishing moment halfway through when drummer Ralph Molina just stops playing, as though he mistakenly thinks the song’s over, before sheepishly starting up again a couple of beats later. But the potency of the grinding din they create is inarguable, elevating Young’s hokey lyrics – Mother Nature pushing Earth around in a pram, etc – adding an unmistakeable edge. They do the same on Shut It Down: the contrast between the sweetness of their harmonies and the corrosive noise of their guitars is enough to distract you from their leader wailing: “What about the animals? What about the birds and bees?”The problem with Colorado is that Young doesn’t want you to be distracted from his lyrics: the pretty Green Is Blue aside, the melodies are largely perfunctory and Young talks as much as he sings. He’s never been more politically and socially engaged than in recent years, which has led him to toss off screeds of songs in the all-the-news-that’s-fit-to-sing style of an old protest folkie. It’s a mode that served him well on 1970’s livid Ohio, but in truth, most of his great sociopolitical songs are oblique: the hallucinatory After the Gold Rush Campaigner’s complex meditation on Richard Nixon’s demise Rockin’ in the Free World’s equivocal response to the collapse of communism. Of late, his political songs have been almost painfully on the nose. As one critic rightly noted of 2015’s The Monsanto Years, the lyrics were so prosaic, it frequently felt like reading an article about the dangers of GMO it was more effective as protest – Monsanto considered suing him – than it was as music. Here, the focus is once more on politics – Roberts’s passing is alluded to in the touching ballad Olden Days, and there are a couple of songs clearly inspired by new wife Daryl Hannah, but other than that, it’s the horrors of climate change, Trump and the alt-right all the way. You never doubt Young’s sincerity, but he expresses his message via cliches and sloganeering.In fairness, maybe he feels he has to be as direct as possible. Most artists who essay this kind of stuff do so expecting their audience to nod in agreement, but Young’s fans don’t necessarily cleave to any liberal consensus, as evidenced by the bedlam caused among their ranks by 2006’s anti-Bush Living With War. But the end result is another Neil Young album to add to the pile of the not-bad and the OK he’s amassed over the last decade, while a steady stream of archive releases highlight how great Neil Young can be at his best: as good as any artist in rock history, and certainly better than this.Floating Points – BiasThe greatness of Sam Shepherd’s second album distilled into one track: starts out as pensive and haunting home listening, explodes into dancefloor life midway through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1782e916768b06b90372556a89bb22bff739225/0_73_3649_2190/master/3649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13d4b7026d6f460e065378f4451d600a","title":"is this the end of the road for remainers podcast","story":"Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss how the pro-EU movement has grown in numbers and developed its own political identity based around opposing Brexit.

On Wednesday morning, shoppers in Winsford’s precinct were split on whether it was the right move.Eileen Barnabas, 82, voted remain and supports her MP’s call for a second referendum. “There’s so many people who will be affected if we do come out,” she says, and in the event of no deal, “it would be worse again”.She thinks the parliamentary shenanigans have been “ludicrous”, and is unsure how she’d vote in a general election: “I used to vote Labour but I’m not too happy with them, but I certainly wouldn’t vote Conservative.”Leanne Dickinson, 55, was not eligible to vote in the referendum because she’s a Dutch citizen. However, she’s grateful for her MP’s actions on behalf of her children, who she says are staunch remainers, and is also hoping for a second referendum.“Lots of people have an idea that the UK can go back to the good old days and this belief that everything in the UK is really, really great … and it isn’t,” she says. “When people voted for leaving, they weren’t voting against the EU, but more about issues within the UK.”Vernon adds: “To be honest, I just want it over and done with … and take the consequences.” He says he would probably vote for Boris Johnson in a general election, although Moss says she’d vote with the rest of her Labour-supporting family.Dilip Solanki-Koli, 64, groaned when Brexit was mentioned. A refugee from Uganda in the 70s, the army veteran was selling poppies in the shopping centre when the  spoke to him. He served in Northern Ireland and says he doesn’t want anything to threaten peace in the region but says he’s “sick of it”.He adds: “The country voted to come out and the politicians are just playing games.” He won’t say how he voted in the referendum but says he won’t take part in an election. “Parliament is not doing what it’s supposed to,” he says. “They’re supposed to represent the people, but they’re not at the moment. I’m not going to vote at all.”Sandbach says her office runs regular surveys asking constituents what they think and is confident she continues to represent those views in Westminster. She objects to her depiction in some of the press as an “arch-remoaner”, pointing out that she has voted in favour of a deal to leave at “every single opportunity”. She says: “I’ve rebelled on process and I believe that parliament should have a say. I’m protecting parliamentary sovereignty against the executive.”She says she is appealing against the withdrawal of the Conservative whip and won’t be drawn on whether she’ll stand as an independent MP if she is not accepted back into the party. She thinks Brexit has “broken down the old party loyalties” and her “principled stance” has earned her respect. “People have genuinely seen that I’ve been willing to put my job on the line for their interests. And there aren’t many MPs that do that.”One of those is Steve Connor, CEO of a communications agency. He lives in a village outside Malpas, where some of Sandbach’s relatives’ names are displayed on the war memorial. Connor, 50, is a lifelong Labour voter and ardent remainer, but admires the “bravery” and “leadership” the MP has shown. He feels “totally disenfranchised” and admits he would feel torn in a general election. “If I was faced with a choice of a strongly anti no-deal, anti-Brexit rebel Tory v a Labour Brexiteer, I’d have no choice. I’d be voting, for the first time in my life, not Labour but for an ex-Tory.”Although he disagrees politically with many of his neighbours, he says “there is no culture war going on”. “My neighbours are still my neighbours, we still have our kids in the same swim team and we have so many values in common.”Sandbach says she is exhausted by the vitriol and “the hate”. She adds: “Frankly, whatever happens in the election, I know that I will have left my mark on Eddisbury, because I got some really major projects through that will change people’s lives locally. And that’s why I do my job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f98d50e894f96771901c8355dddf2bc626b5157/0_566_6604_3962/master/6604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db0d583bc5e1bd42ec3b3f42fb080eb","title":"people revolted mooncup bust period taboos","story":"The makers of the silicone menstrual cup had to overcome disgust and suspicion when they launched the company two decades ago. Now they are busy breaking new barriersThere was a time in the early 2000s when it felt as though no public toilet was safe from the guerrilla stickering of Mooncup fans. Festivals, university loos, clubs and pubs – if someone could be sat with their knickers down, then the chances are there would be a little white sticker in front of them offering a “safer, greener, cheaper” period.Except they didn’t use the word period back then. In 2002, when Mooncup – the world’s first reusable silicone menstrual cup – was launched by two women in Brighton, the word was still taboo. “People were revolted by what we were doing,” says Eileen Greene, one of the founders and directors of the company. “People really weren’t talking about periods at all. We were quite radical. We would do stalls at festivals and trade shows and we would call it the ‘repulsion zone’ – this semicircle around the stall where people wouldn’t even want to come near us.”What a difference 17 years make. I meet Greene and Kath Clements – another of Mooncup’s directors, who joined in 2005, in their Brighton offices. They have outgrown the bedroom in the Whitehawk estate where the company was founded, when a team of two were cramped between piles of leaflets, cups and stickers. Now a 40-strong outfit, Mooncup has a proper office and a kitchen with a long wooden table, which is where the staff cook and eat a vegan lunch together every day. They do yoga here, too, and meditation. “It’s just what we’ve always done,” says Greene.If you are unfamiliar with the Mooncup, think of it as a bendy silicone eggcup, that, when inserted into the vagina, collects menstrual blood. You can leave it in for around eight hours, because it holds about three times as much fluid as a regular tampon. When you take it out, you just tip the blood away, give it a rinse (a water bottle will do if you don’t want to use the public sink) and reinsert it. Each Mooncup lasts for about 10 years, so the £22 price tag should recoup itself after six months of saving on other sanitary products. I have a friend who has been using one since her teens and, now in her mid 30s, has only ever spent about £40 on her period in her whole life. Then, of course, there is the environmental benefit of ridding the world of the estimated 200,000 tonnes of sanitary waste that ends up in landfill in the UK each year.This month marks a major turning point, too: for the first time since the product’s launch, the packaging has been redesigned to show the cup on the front of the box. “We’ve always had a white box with a flower on it,” says Greene. “Which was a way of saying: ‘Look, this isn’t a scary thing.’ Now, we feel able to be more up front.”In the past decade there has been a dramatic cultural shift away from the hushed tones and euphemisms used for anything related to a woman’s menstrual cycle. “In 2015, you could really see the taboo around periods starting to break,” says Clements. She points to the tennis player Heather Watson saying that she performed poorly in the Australian Open because of her period and the musician Kiran Gandhi, who ran the London Marathon free bleeding, as key moments in changing public discourse around menstruation that year. “And we’d played our part in that – very committedly trying to shift the conversation around periods,” she says. But she emphasises that this is a shift restricted to the UK: “Because in many countries, it is not the case at all.” The first menstrual cup was invented by an American actor, Leona Chalmers, who patented her runner cup in 1937. Greene stumbled on the idea in the late 1990s, when a woman on a Critical Mass bike ride through London told her about them. “I was like: ‘Wow, I’ve never heard of anything like that.’” A year later, Greene went travelling around Australia. “I was camping in Boonoo Boonoo national park and opposite me was this British family. There was a woman washing reusable nappies in a bucket – which you really didn’t see very often back then, and I was intrigued.” That woman was Su Hardy, whom Greene would tell about the menstrual cup. Hardy was so enthralled that, when she got back to the UK, she managed to track one down in the US. “At that time, they were fairly rudimentary rubber cups. She started importing them on a small scale, and selling then to friends of friends. They were OK, but some people had a reaction to the latex, so that got her thinking: ‘How can I improve this? And she came up with the idea of making it from medical-grade silicone instead. She made it a 21st-century product.” By this point, Hardy had moved to Brighton and the fledgling business operated out of her house. “It was so chaotic,” says Clements. “You couldn’t even move your chair.” The stickers were Hardy’s idea. “Su’s one-woman crusade,” laughs Clements. “She was going around stickering public toilets. Every day, she’d run off to the post office with this wicker basket full of orders. Each Mooncup would come with a sticker, so our users started stickering, too. “It’s such a different concept to the tampons and pads that we’ve all been used to using. People really need to hear it from someone else.”There was a natural hesitance among consumers, whose relationship with tampon brands is often embedded in their school years. “I remember the Tampax lady coming into our school really fondly – which shows how clever they are about it,” says Clements. It must be galling, then, to see rival menstrual cups flooding a market that they created. How do they feel about Tampax launching its own menstrual cup? “They have clearly seen a commercial opportunity, that times are changing, and they’ve jumped on the bandwagon,” says Greene. Tampax’s product, however, not only comes in a plastic container, but plastic packaging, too. “You would have hoped they would focus on eliminating single-use plastic. That would be a diligent environmental approach, rather than just adding another product to the range.”As for the other brands, Clements thinks it is worth cautiously celebrating that their efforts have “transformed the feminine hygiene aisle”. Yet she warns that companies should also be thinking about “where it’s being manufactured and if colours are being added to it. Also, I’ve seen some brands saying they need replacing every year, and some that come in plastic packaging.”This distaste for waste is the reason Mooncup will not be expanding its range, says Greene. “We won’t make wipes or washes – those paraphernalia of consumerism – because they are simply not needed.”When Hardy retired in 2014, she transferred ownership of the business to the employees. Even the salaries are shared openly. “I sometimes forget that this is quite radical practice,” says Clements. Has it even been fraught? It can, she admits, be challenging at times. “People bring a lot of personal feeling to conversations around money.”I wonder if there was any disharmony about the decision to sell via Asos, given the criticism of the company’s record on workers’ rights and its warehouses, which have been described as “dark satanic mills” by unions. “They are clearly striving to improve,” says Greene. “From our perspective, it felt like an opportunity to reach a whole new demographic.”Aside from the fact some women may still feel squeamish about the idea of such close contact with menstrual blood (which users say is minimal), there are few criticisms of Mooncup. But it is not advisable for use in places where there is no clean water to sterilise it, or if an internal product is not suitable, says Greene.In recent years, the company has ventured into advertising (working with an advertising agency that had been run as a workers’ cooperative) but the directors are wary of pushing their ethical credentials too far. “There are so many voices claiming that they believe in a cause,” says Clements. So they took a different approach. Firstly, it was the Love Your Vagina posters – which got them into hot water after people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the word “vagina” being on a poster. Then there was 2015’s “Period Drama” – which poked fun at Poldark, by featuring a weak maiden on the back of a horse with a man, galloping to find her the right tampons when all she really needs is her Mooncup. “The aim was to allow space for the more complex feminist conversations to happen within advertising,” says Clements.In fact, the filming of the advert turned into a feminist drama in itself. “When the trainer of the horse realised the job was for a sanitary product advert, he pulled out at the last minute. Because he thought the reputation of his horse would be sullied,” Clements says with a laugh.I can’t leave without telling the founders the only negative story I managed to extract from the dozens of Mooncup users I spoke to (who were all evangelical about its benefits). It was from a friend who said that, in 10 years, she had only “had one leak,” but described it as “apocalyptic”. “With a tampon,” she pointed out “you might get a dribble with a Mooncup it’s a small cupful.”“Hmm,” says Clements, thoughtfully. “Leakage usually happens at the beginning. That’s why we have the phone support service to help people who are new to using the cup. Often people place it too high up the vagina, because it’s instinctively where you would put your tampon. Instead, you wear it lower to form a seal with the vaginal wall.” She seems genuinely perplexed and promises to look into the matter.As for the future, what is next for Mooncup is flaunting the new packaging, and trying to reach as many people as possible. Do Clements and Greene ever get bored of talking about periods all day long? “It’s funny if you’ve been working at a festival for a few days,” says Clements. “At the end of the week, you often don’t know people’s names. But you know everybody’s gynaecological history.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4ebe4368a1c08ca44d3ccfad6b0d0149a047ec/74_77_3652_2190/master/3652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbd97e75ea07478b288348136f2ea576","title":"great britain jon bateman canberra raiders rugby league","story":"Bradford-born forward has just enjoyed a fine debut season with Canberra Raiders and now he is focused on winning four Tests from four with Great BritainAuckland is about as far away from Bradford as you can get in every sense, but early on Saturday morning a small corner of the West Yorkshire city will be shunning a lie-in to meet up and watch one of their own fulfil a childhood dream on the other side of the world when Great Britain face Tonga. This has been a year to remember for John Bateman but even while establishing himself as one of the world’s best rugby league players, the forward has never forgotten his humble roots.“It’s all pretty mad for a lad from Bradford,” laughs Bateman on the eve of his Great Britain debut. The 26-year-old had been tipped for the top ever since he emerged as a teenager at his hometown club eight years ago, but even by those standards this has been some rise.Having become one of the best talents in the British game with Wigan, Bateman’s form earned him a move to the NRL with Canberra this season. “I just wanted to go there and play some games – I had no idea how I’d do,” he admits. “We’ve had a couple of weeks since the season finished and it’s just about started to sink in.”With Bateman impressing throughout his first season in Australia, Canberra reached the Grand Final for the first time in 25 years. They ultimately fell just short of the title, losing to Sydney Roosters, but Bateman has become a sensation in the country. It is a far cry not only from his upbringing in England, but also his first impressions of life 12,000 miles away. “I won’t lie, when I first got here I thought I wanted to go home,” he reflects. “But I’ve really settled, and Canberra now feels like home.“The benefit of playing so well this year means I now get the chance to play for Great Britain, which is something you dream of doing as a kid when you’re getting up early to watch the tour games on television.” There will be plenty of support for Bateman back at home this time too. “They opened up my amateur club, Dudley Hill, early in the morning for the Grand Final … maybe they’ll do the same again for this,” he says. “Loads of the lads I grew up with have sent me messages this week saying they’re all tuning in. That’s nice to hear and makes me proud of where I’m from.”Bateman’s upbringing, which saw him raised in a working-class area of Bradford, has never been far from his thinking, even after the fame and fortune Australian rugby league has now provided him with.“It’s one thing I’ve always stood by, that no matter where I go and what I do, I always go back home,” Bateman adds. “You look at the big teams I’ve been lucky to play for like Wigan and Bradford, but it’s Dudley Hill that I give the most credit to. They’ve made me the person I am and the player I am. There’s already a get-together arranged for when I go home after the tour. They’re the people that have helped get me to where I am today.”But before the Christmas celebrations can begin in Bradford, there is a job to do with Great Britain. Two Tests against New Zealand and a visit to Papua New Guinea follow Saturday’s match with Tonga, two years on from England’s dramatic 20-18 victory in the semi-finals of the World Cup in Auckland.“It was a crazy day,” Bateman, who will start in the back row, recalls. “It’s one of those days you’ll never forget for lots of reasons, and hopefully Saturday is the same. They’re a big, powerful side and they’ve got a number of world-class players in there, so it’s going to be tough. But this group backs itself against any side in the world.”“We have expectation now rather than hope. Our aim is literally nothing else but winning four games out of four over the next month. We know we’re a great side and it’s going to be an honour to pull that Great Britain jersey on. Not just for me but for my grandparents, my mum, my daughter and everyone back in Bradford, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a566dda42fc0ed73cfe898934058ce29cda94daa/0_241_4818_2890/master/4818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d48cefcb0d09505bf113db4b04f3ef9","title":"cyrano review bristol old vic","story":"Bristol Old VicA strong poetic lead and fine support can’t make this meandering new adaptation anything more than a slog‘That was mercifully short,” one actor jokingly sneers, after the audience are awkwardly and inexplicably cajoled into singing. After slogging through almost three hours of meandering plot and muted laughter, it is a shame the same can’t be said of this new adaptation of Edmond Rostand’s French dramedy.Tom Morris’s uneven production pulls from the Bristol Old Vic bag of tricks: the makeshift aesthetic, the self-aware on-stage band, the foul-mouthed cast in period dress apologising as they clamber over the audience. But the playfulness here is scrappy rather than thoughtful, clutching at ways to try and make us laugh during the too-long, too-tangential script. Translator Peter Oswald keeps the play in verse, with some exquisitely romantic lines about theatre, love and self-reliance, but the script leans heavily on incongruence. (Giving a 17th character a swear word is not a substitute for giving them a personality.)Our protagonist, Cyrano, is the only character who feels full-blooded, played with verve by Tristan Sturrock. He is a witty wordsmith, though women are repulsed by his larger-than-average nose. With a classic theatrical blind eye towards casual incest, Cyrano is hopelessly in love with his (distant) cousin Roxane (Sara Powell), who is distracted by the cocky Christian (Patrycja Kujawska). While Christian has the looks, he lacks the wit to woo Roxane. As they head off to war, Cyrano agrees to write letters as if sent from Christian, his only reward being the satisfaction of witnessing the effect of his words on the woman he loves.As misunderstanding and mourning ensue, the production falls short of the heights of heroic comedy and the depths of romantic tragedy, plodding along flatly somewhere in between. Though the ensemble are strong – Miltos Yerolemou is effortlessly hilarious – the physical comedy is flaccid and the chemistry flat, undermining the play’s emotional impact.Rostand’s original introduced the word panache, suggesting flamboyance and reckless courage, into English in 1897. Despite a strong poetic lead and a hard-working cast, this production is sorely lacking in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad176da02b238b9bc99ebbc4029f9bc5ed0e69a2/455_73_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c98fe883f6528c750f38836544c1303","title":"whoopi goldberg returns to sister act musical in west end","story":"Star will reprise role she played in two hit films on London stage alongside Jennifer SaundersWhoopi Goldberg is set to reprise her role in Sister Act when the hit musical returns to the West End next year.The musical is based on the 1992 film of the same name, which earned Goldberg her third Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Deloris Van Cartier, a singer who hides in a convent after witnessing a murder.The stage production, which opens at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith for a limited run next July, will see Goldberg star opposite Jennifer Saunders as Mother Superior.“Yes, the original Deloris is back,” Goldberg said in a promotional video. “A little older, a little seasoned, but really still kind of out there.”Saunders, best known as the star of Absolutely Fabulous and one half of comedy duo French and Saunders, said she thought the show “could be the event of the century”.The musical will feature an original score by eight time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken, best known for his work on Disney films including The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.While fans expressed excitement online, many criticised the high cost of tickets, which range from £29 to almost ten times that, with top prices hitting £249.Rachel Gilbey, 35, said she was an avid musical theatre fan and excited about the casting, but said that ticket prices made the show inaccessible.Gilbey, who is short-sighted and not very tall, said she books tickets on the first few rows of theatres to avoid her view being blocked. Theses seats cost more than £170 for Sister Act.“It seems incredibly expensive,” she said. “This summer I saw the new production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, with Jason Donovan and should have been Sheridan Smith, and that was Row B stalls for only £85.”Theatre blogger Beyond the Curtain described the announcement as “wonderful”, but said that ticket prices were “so disappointing”. “£41.25 alone for the back row (row Z) of the circle. Pricing audiences out. Makes me sad,” he tweeted.Charles Thomson, a 31-year-old freelance writer, said that he and his friends are reconsidering their plans to attend the show because of the “exorbitant price”.“This is sadly part of a growing trend in London theatre,” he said. “A lot of fans are being priced out of shows and the inevitable result will be that theatre is increasingly only accessible to the elite, which is a travesty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0056c2faf6d5e76f92629adb7db9d0a03c5679fb/154_86_2084_1250/master/2084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24d42a56b585b6e08c737cc1d8c4d71b","title":"which is best ipad air or ipad pro 11","story":"Len wants to replace a Samsung Tab S2. Should he buy the 11in iPad Pro or an iPad Air with extra storage?I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7.I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can’t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? LenThe challenge for anyone designing a computing device – whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone – is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user’s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory andor storage space.This is the problem with both the iPad Pro 11 and 12.9, and why you are stuck with a choice you should not have to face.It’s not hard to read the trends in the technology market, and two obvious ones apply here.First, people need more storage to handle both apps and digital content that is now cheap or free, and, thanks to higher broadband speeds, easy to download. We’re no longer listening to 64kbps MP3 files or watching 640 x 480-pixel movies, and file sizes are much bigger than they used to be. So are web pages.Under the circumstances, 64GB is only fit for smartphones, Chromebooks and netbook-type Windows laptops. Shipping a high-end £769 tablet such as the iPad Pro with only 64GB is insane. It should have 128GB, which would be a rational fit with companion models that have 256GB (£919), 512GB (£1,119) and 1TB (£1,319). Then, each step up would double the storage.There’s another way to look at this. If you buy a 64GB iPad Pro 11 then you are paying £12 per gigabyte of storage. If you buy the 256GB version, the price drops to £3.59 per gigabyte, and at 1TB it’s only £1.29. Putting 128GB in the entry-level model – £6 per gigabyte – wouldn’t make it a bargain, but it would be in line with the rest of the range. And the extra cost of fitting 128GB would be peanuts at retail prices, without even considering the massive discounts Apple must get for buying them by the million.In short, I don’t think you, or anyone, should buy a 64GB iPad Pro. Either bust your budget and buy an iPad Pro 11 with 256GB of storage space, or get an Air with the same amount.Alternatively, wait for Apple to release new versions of the iPad Pro that start at 128GB. This could happen in November – the current models were released in November last year – or perhaps in March 2020, or later. Your Tab S2 isn’t dead yet …You’re already an experienced tablet user with 160GB of storage, so you should have a good idea how much space you will need. My own rule of thumb is to try to double everything with each new device, because you will always need more of everything in the future, and less-than-doubling rarely feels like a real advance.Unfortunately, tablets, smartphones and ultra-thin laptops don’t let you upgrade the processor. You’ll be stuck with it for the next five or more years. It’s a good idea to aim high.The Apple-approved method is to store as much as possible online in its iCloud rather than on the device, and to stream content such as music and movies rather than playing it locally. Streaming often depends on having a usable broadband or mobile connection, which can lead to buffering. It may also consume bandwidth and server resources, so it isn’t very green.In the case of cloud storage and streaming, remember that you can use any cloud – Dropbox, Microsoft’s OneDrive, Google One etc – not just iCloud. Also, you can stream music and movies wirelessly from a local PC or NAS server, if available.Perhaps you could manage with only 64GB of storage, if you put up with the extra cost of add-ons, and the extra inconvenience. It’s not too hard if you have a PC to do the heavy lifting. But if you are paying £769 and it’s your main device, as this seems to be, you shouldn’t have to.The 10.5in iPad Air (2019) is pretty much the same as the 10.5in iPad Pro (2017), only faster, so naturally the iPad Pro 11 (2018) has several advantages. These include the slightly larger screen, which is brighter (600 v 500 nits) and supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which Apple calls ProMotion. It also has an eight-core A12X Bionic chip, where the Air has the smaller six-core A12 version used in the iPhone XR and XS. Both include embedded M12 motion coprocessors, plus the eight-core “Neural Engine” that the entry-level iPad’s A10 Fusion chip lacks.The extra power of the A12X supports the doubling of the screen refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz, which should make a difference when playing games or using the Pencil, but it’s not a dealbreaker for most purposes. In fact, the two chips are so similar that pundits are expecting new versions of the iPad Pro with improved A13 processors, like those in the new iPhone 11.The question is whether you would derive any significant benefits from the iPad Pro 11’s better features. It seems to me that unless you plan to get into gaming or drawing, you’d be paying for things you don’t really need. You’d be better off spending your budget on accessories for the iPad Air. The options include a keyboard (£159), Apple Pencil (£89), and AppleCare (£69) from Apple, as well as all kinds of products from other suppliers.Have you got a question?

Up Helly Aa is a wild, torchlit party with costumed Norse revellers, all-night dancing and drinking, bonfires, processions and blazing ships which celebrate the island’s connections with Scandinavia. The main theme is who can be the Lord of Lerwick, apparently by being the last person standing as the festivities end. Many of the characters portrayed were real vikings with fascinating stories attached to them.

Over the course of one fortnight in November one of the biggest illuminated parades in the world travels around the county, warming chilly high streets with a procession of floats bearing thousands of lights, banging pop tunes, and sulky tweenagers dressed in masquerade costumes. The route takes in towns such as Bridgwater, Shepton Mallet and Weston-super-Mare, but my favourite venue is Glastonbury, if only for the conjunction of stoned hippies, drunk locals, and bemused-looking visitors.

The theme changes each year, but the carnival always includes enormous sculptures made from oranges and lemons (entry costs €10). There are also multiple parades filled with citrus floats and dancers (tickets cost €25 seated, €12 standing).

Aside from a brisk trade in whole white truffles and stalls selling truffle-flavoured everything, there were exhibitions, crafts and a huge pop-up restaurant tent serving a truffle-heavy menu. There was even a workshop where you could take your dog to test its truffling potential. Our highlight was the candlelit evening truffle hunting expedition (€10 adults) which took us through farmland with a truffle-hunter and his dog, finishing in woodland where the dog excitedly dug up a few truffles, though it ate half of them before we had a chance to catch a glimpse!

The festival is held all over Spain, but we really enjoyed the one held in Valderrobres village, where on the night of the 16th there is a spectacular bonfire at which cakes and drinks are passed around. Early the following morning everyone is invited to participate in a community breakfast – mainly local sausages and chorizo roasted in the embers of the fire.

It wasn’t even her first viral moment that dayIt isn’t often that you hear someone rave about a great congressional hearing they’ve seen online. Heck, outside of big national events, I’m going to bet you have never willingly watched C-Span.But less than one year since she entered Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has represented New York’s 14th congressional district since January, has changed that.AOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energizing viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle.This is exactly what happened on Wednesday during her questioning of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg about his early awareness of the disgraced political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested millions of Facebook users’ personal information to influence the 2016 US election. The confrontation is uncomfortable to watch, with Ocasio-Cortez grilling Zuckerberg on key details about his knowledge back then – he denies having any – and then ending on the zinger:“You don’t know? This was the largest data scandal with respect to your company, that had catastrophic impacts on the 2016 election. You don’t know?”She is met with a squirming Zuckerberg and therein, a viral moment is made.This wasn’t her first time capturing people’s attention with her line of questioning. In fact, it wasn’t even her first time that day.Just hours before she made Zuckerberg eat his own words, AOC attended a hearing with the oil giant ExxonMobil.In the video, she shows Martin Hoffert, a consultant for the company, a graph he worked on from 1982 and asks him to describe it. Thus she gets him to explain how the company knew about climate change before she was even born – predicting its levels accurately until the present day.The stinger comes at the end, when Hoffert testifies: “We were excellent scientists,” and she adds: “Yes. You were: so they knew.”During this hearing, Ocasio-Cortez exposes an American double standard: that white supremacist acts of violence are treated as hate crimes, while similar violence committed by Muslims is treated as terrorism.Her cunning ability to use the FBI’s own rhetoric against it is what makes it so watchable. She gets the bureau’s assistant director for counter-terrorism to describe terrorism in his own terms, and then repeatedly uses his own definitions as a stick to beat him with.Ocasio-Cortez achieves the seemingly impossible: turning a discussion about the intricacies of campaign finance into a clear and immensely watchable three-minute video. The clip, which was uploaded by the leftwing channel NowThis news, has been viewed more than 37m times, making it the most watched political video ever posted to Twitter.She starts out with the proposition “let’s play a game” – and off she goes.In this game, she is the self-interested bad guy, trying to make as much money as possible. She checks in every now and then with the panel of government watchdogs, to see how much she can get away with. The answer? Pretty much everything – playing into her point that of course the system is broken.After Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal failed to pass the Senate, she gave the GOP a supreme telling off by tearing down the presumption that only elites care about the environment. In the clip, she asks:“You want to tell people that their desire for clean air and water is elitist? … I don’t think so.”If she has already proven that she can act as a great game-show host and detective – here is proof that she excels in giving a lecture, too:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/717068f4c10761bd5d4881902ee7b28977b75044/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b402941b47093ba999da5773ee6625e5","title":"us elections 2020 richest zip codes fundraising","story":" fundraising analysis reveals wealthy areas’ fondness for moderate Democrats The town of Atherton, California has only 7,000 residents, but it’s home to enough titans of the tech industry to field a polo team: Sheryl Sandberg, Eric Schmidt, Meg Whitman, Tim Draper and Marc Andreessen are just some of the Silicon Valley suburb’s rich and famous. When the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg decamped from British public life to Facebook public relations, he traded a townhouse in Putney for a $9m estate in the exclusive enclave.Americans who live in the country’s 20 wealthiest zip codes have donated the most to the moderate Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Booker and Joe Biden, a  analysis of presidential campaign finance filings for the first nine months of 2019 found. The vast majority of the fundraising from the 20 wealthy areas went to Democrats. Residents of these bastions of actual limousine liberals – including Westchester, New York, Beverly Hills, and Greenwich, Connecticut – have ponied up nearly $880,000 for Senator Harris and nearly $600,000 for Mayor Buttigieg. Booker and the former vice-president Biden raised more than half a million dollars each.Donald Trump cashed his share of checks, too. The president raised more than $500,000 in total across the 20 locales, and was the top recipient in three: Palm Beach, Florida Newport Beach, California and Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump spends significant time at his private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach and his golf club in Bedminster.Meanwhile, the senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are among the frontrunners nationally, have amassed the largest campaign war chests of all the Democratic candidates while refusing to hold high-dollar fundraisers and calling for higher taxes on the wealthy. Their aversion to the rich appears to be reciprocal.Sanders, who has raised the most of all Democratic candidates this cycle, has received just $59,130.05 from donors in these areas. Warren brought in slightly more than $160,000.The ’s analysis does not include every donor because campaigns are not required to report contributions from those who gave less than $200 in total. We used data from the Internal Revenue Service to identify those zip codes with at least 1,000 tax-filing households and the highest average adjusted gross income.Booker’s haul in Atherton – $95,650 – tops Sanders’ total across all 20 zip codes. The former mayor of Newark also topped the list just north of San Francisco in Marin, and in a number of wealthy suburbs of New York City – Westchester, New York Short Hills, New Jersey and Old Westbury, New York.Harris was a close second in Atherton, and the California senator also came out first in other elite neighborhoods in her home state: Palo Alto downtown San Francisco Century City, Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. She also topped the list for Tribeca in New York City.Though Buttigieg brought in the second-highest amount of total fundraising from the 20 wealthiest zip codes, he only topped the list in Greenwich, Connecticut – a bastion of New England blue blood and the childhood home of George HW Bush.Of course, political donors in these zip codes only represent a tiny fraction of the American public – and account for less than $4m of the hundreds of millions of dollars that have already been donated to 2020 presidential candidates.We did the same analysis of the poorest 20 zip codes with at least 1,000 tax filers – a list that includes poor neighborhoods in cities such as St Louis, Missouri Erie, Pennsylvania Tallahassee, Florida and Cincinnati, Ohio. Across all 20 areas, campaigns have reported just 28 donors, for a total of $7,113.31.Sanders was the clear favorite, bringing in nearly $3,200 from 12 donors, followed by Trump ($965) and Andrew Yang ($894).We also looked at political fundraising by residents of major metropolitan areas – where the majority of Americans live.These results demonstrate a distinct home-field advantage. Harris, of California, wins out in San Francisco and Los Angeles, while Warren, of Massachusetts, takes the prize in Boston and New Jersey. New Jersey’s Booker tops the list in neighboring New York City. Buttigieg, a midwestern mayor, performed best in Chicago.Trump swept a number of major cities across the southern half of the US, racking up the most money in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, Arizona. Beto O’Rourke was the top Democratic fundraiser in both Dallas and Houston, while Biden led Democrats in Atlanta and Miami and Sanders won the most Democratic support in Phoenix.

The rally had been billed as a discussion of government’s role in society, and was held in the downstairs room of a public library in Peterborough, south-east New Hampshire.It was an inauspicious start to the two days the  spent with Sestak, 67, who is spending three weeks campaigning in New Hampshire – including walking 105 miles (169km) across the state – as he seeks to build momentum for his little-known campaign to take on Donald Trump in the race for the White House in 2020.But it was also an insight into the difficulty that even seemingly well-qualified candidates have in breaking through the noise of a densely populated Democratic field, and the money and effort spent on campaigning that runs under the radar.Sestak, 67, spent four years in the House of Representatives, representing a traditionally Republican Pennsylvania district, until 2010. He announced his run for the presidency on 23 June. Before this New Hampshire sojourn, he had spent three months in Iowa, holding 235 events, driving 17,000 miles (27,000km) and, according to his campaign, “shaking nearly 30,000 hands”. He started his ramble across New Hampshire on 13 October, and is planning to cover 105 miles (169km) in eight days.On the same day, Sestak met Allen in Peterborough, the 12 leading Democratic candidates were debating in Ohio on CNN. The audience was 8.3 million: disappointing for CNN, but priceless exposure to someone like Sestak.Yet, to his credit, Sestak persevered with his one-person crowd in Peterborough. He’d walked there, after all – seven miles, from Dublin. Sestak’s staff will pick him up and drive him to some of his farther-flung New Hampshire events, but he plonks a stick in the ground at the end of each walk, and starts there again the next day.That same persistence was eventually rewarded at his Peterborough event, when, after speaking to Kath Allen and three journalists for half an hour, a second person showed up. And after listening to Sestak, Allen was impressed.He had answered her questions about senior care, and healthcare – he prefers the centrist Medicare-for-all-who-want-it-style plan, rather than the more progressive, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders proposal of Medicare for All. He had confidently fielded queries from the latecomer, about nuclear power. (He is in favor, but wants to use thorium reactors, not uranium.) But Allen wasn’t planning to vote for him, and she was skeptical about whether he will be the Democratic nominee.“I don’t think he can get it,” Allen said. “People want the flamboyant. And he’s not well-known.”“I like other candidates, I like Tulsi, I like Joe. I really like what Joe has to say on most of the things,” Allen said. “But I don’t know. I’m gonna see how this plays out.”By the time Sestak entered the race, most of the other candidates had been running for months. (John Delaney, a businessman and three-term congressman, had been running for almost two years.)Sestak announced his candidacy late because he was caring for his daughter, who had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time. Happily, she is now in recovery, but his late entry means other candidates have pulled ahead. It goes without saying that his rivals have drawn larger crowds. Some 15,000 people attended an Elizabeth Warren rally in Seattle in August, and her campaign said 20,000 came out to an event in New York City in September.As the 12 leading candidates prepped to go onstage, Sestak attended his third event of the day: a local Democratic party meeting in Goffstown, 40 minutes north-east of Peterborough.It was 6.30pm before Sestak arrived and started speaking – 10 people had shown up – and he had another event in Windham, 35 minutes away, at 7.30pm. He promised to keep it short, and started with a joke.“I’m actually in the debate tonight,” Sestak told the crowd.“Online,” Sestak said. “We’re doing a live stream, in a Dunkin’ Donuts.”Sestak had used the same gag at the Peterborough library, where Allen had been halfway out of her chair going for a high five before he dropped the punchline.As promised, that night Sestak held his own online debate. He answered the same questions posed to the candidates on stage, live from a Dunkin’. Sestak was sitting quite far away from the camera and it was difficult to hear him. At 9.57pm, just three people were watching the live stream on Sestak’s Facebook page, and the  was one of them.Part of Sestak’s problem may be that he is a centrist, white, older man, in a field with plenty of centrist, white, older men. Sestak’s USP, though, is his foreign policy experience and, given the chance, he ties it well to other aspects of the presidency.“We need someone who can unite this country and convene the world,” Sestak says, promising to bring the country together in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidency. met Sestak again the day after the debate, in Peterborough, where he had planted his stick on Tuesday. He had 18 miles (29km) to walk on Wednesday, and he expected to be on the road until 11pm. We set off walking east, uphill, at a fast pace, Sestak wearing black hiking boots. He walked across Pennsylvania in 2015, when he campaigned for the Senate – he lost in the primary – and believes the benefits outweigh any potential pain.“It seems to be catching a little bit,” he said of his campaign. As well as walking and meeting people, Sestak is running a TV ad campaign in New Hampshire.“We see people who are seeing our ads. It’s coming to a point of once you know I’m out here serving, trying to serve you, and they’re interested.”Sestak doesn’t regret entering the race late. But he agrees he missed out on early exposure.“Would my position have been enhanced if I had got in earlier? With the town halls happening, I think it would be a bit easier,” Sestak said. With his lower profile, his campaign has been told by some of the main networks that they won’t book him for interviews – even on foreign policy, despite his experience.That fundraising total, combined with his polling, means he is highly unlikely to meet the threshold for the next televised Democratic debate in November. But, marching uphill in New Hampshire, Sestak told the  he had no plans to drop out.“I wouldn’t go through this if I didn’t think we have a possibility of winning,” he said.He had an additional 16 miles (26km) to go that day – a long way, but nothing compared with the distance he has to make up if he is to be the Democrat’s choice in the race for the White House."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779f820d6c2e1915c6cd2798ff6b6268069169fd/0_157_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=793307bbecf4a1fda9921978a1516853","title":"five conflict photographers on some of the hardest images theyve taken","story":"The new book Conversations on Conflict Photography delves into the stories behind some of the most critical images photographers have had to takeby Lauren Walsh, compiled by  Jehan Jillani in New YorkIn the newly published Conversations on Conflict Photography, Lauren Walsh, a professor at New York University and the New School, discusses the visual documentation of suffering with award-winning photographers, photo editors and representatives of major humanitarian organizations.The excerpts below delve into the stories behind some of the most critical images these photographers have had to take during the course of their profession.Shahidul Alam is a Bangladeshi photographer and the founder of Drik Picture Library, a Bangladesh-based photo agency. Alam has documented a wide range of events, including the movement for democracy in Bangladesh, natural disasters, human rights and social issues like class inequality and murders by the “death squads” in Bangladesh. As a result of his work, Alam has received death threats, and in 2018, he was arrested after publicly criticizing the government’s violent response to student protests.Her entire family had died, her home was gone, and there she was. Of course, I was very concerned about her.What happened afterwards, for me, is more relevant to the picture than the picture itself. Pretty soon after I took that photo, the girl found a home. There was another family, just as destitute, who took her on as their child. And that is really what the story is about. Horrendous things will happen to people it’s what happens afterwards that teaches you about a people and a place. To me, it’s remarkable that the poorest people I’ve ever come across are also the most generous. That overwhelms me.Susan Meiselas, an American photographer who has documented conflict and human rights issues, has been active in the field of photography for four decades. Some of her photos from the insurrection in Nicaragua in the late 1970s are widely considered iconic, and her subsequent documentation of the Salvadoran civil war, including the El Mozote massacre in the early 1980s, has received broad acclaim.“Context is so important. For example, for the image I took of the body on the hillside, I made a book to create a context for it. The photo had not been published in any news media. But it was an image central to understanding the violence happening at that time. The idea of someone being ‘disappeared’ – meaning executed and dumped on the side of a road – was not an American experience, and hence the vital need to present it in a fuller context. The level of repression in Nicaragua, when the photo was taken, had already unleashed a militant response and eventually the popular insurrection erupted. The intention of this image, especially its value then, was to help show a part of that story in a raw, evocative way. So I don’t think such graphic images should be considered gratuitous. And I do think they have to be contextualized.That photo, which was taken at Cuesta del Plomo, is from four decades ago, and if I were thinking about a more contemporary setting, let’s say witnessing one of the Isis beheadings, I’d ask, ‘What would I do now? Would I not make an image? If I make an image, what do I do with the image?’ Obviously, Isis has used images, which they make themselves, to shock us, and they have achieved that very effectively. But if you were the documentarian witness, right there on site, what would your responsibility be? And if you make the picture, what would you be trying to communicate? Are we implicated when it is a live execution? That is, is it inherently a performance for us? Alternatively, what would it mean to decide right then not to make it? Or to be forcefully prevented from making it? Or to never have the evidence that such things happened? I don’t know all the answers.And if you can only get access with the permission of Isis, what does that imply? When I was in Central America, the conditions were that you could be independent of any single force or faction, so you could move across borders and not be aligned, and that is rarely possible now.”Ron Haviv, an award-winning American photojournalist and Emmy-nominated film-maker, is a co-founder of the photo agency VII, which is dedicated to documenting conflict and increasing awareness of human rights issues around the world.“This appears to have been a room for executions. It’s in a hospital in Tripoli, and this image is a bit mysterious. So while I did speak about the universality of the ‘language’ of photography, there are also times when photographs can be enhanced with text. I don’t think there’s any way to know from this picture exactly what has happened. But what I hope comes across is that this is sinister something really bad happened here. You may not know immediately that somebody was executed, but you have a certain sensibility in response to this image.All this said, I try to balance between aesthetics and content. I don’t want content overshadowed by style. In other words, I don’t want my aesthetic to go past a point where you really don’t understand what’s going on. For example, I won’t give you a picture of a bird flying over a massacre that’s just a beautiful picture of a bird. That achieves something, but it’s not what I’m trying to achieve with my work. So I’m endeavoring to find that balance: there’ll be a picture of a bird flying over a massacre, but you’re still going to know the massacre happened right there.And then of course, the caption puts you over to the next level. So take the picture from the hospital – you know something really bad happened here. There’s what is presumably blood dripping down the wall, and there are holes in the wall. They look like bullet holes. The caption will then fill in the blanks: ‘Hospital workers clean up after numerous bodies were found abandoned in a hospital where executions appeared to take place.’”Eman Helal is an Egyptian photographer based in Cairo. She covered the 2011 Egyptian revolution and its aftermath, including a project on injured protesters as well as work on sectarian violence against Christians, especially after the 2013 military coup. She also focuses on social issues, such as the physical and sexual harassment of women in Egypt, and efforts to empower women there.“This is from the big Muslim Brotherhood camp at a mosque called Rabaa al-Adawiya. The day before this, police killed a huge number of people, trying to break up the camp. Some from the Muslim Brotherhood escaped with these bodies because they were afraid the police would take them. They brought the bodies to another nearby mosque. Hundreds of people died in this attack, and the people who managed this other mosque wrote down and posted the names of the dead. Everyone who had relatives in that camp went to this other mosque for information about their family members. They went to see if they could find the bodies of their relatives. This particular photo shows a woman crying by the body of her son.A young woman with the Muslim Brotherhood came over because she heard me screaming. I hugged her and told her, ‘My life is in your hands. Please don’t leave me.’ I told her that I came to tell the true story, not to put a spin on my coverage. She asked to see my photos, so I showed her – pictures of dead bodies, injured people. There was nothing that made the Muslim Brotherhood look bad. She tried to convince the other people of this, but they didn’t want to listen to her. After negotiations, they said I could take my camera with me if I left the memory card. So I had to leave without any pictures. That was really hard.The next day, I went to the mosque where the bodies had been moved. I was afraid that someone from the day before might remember me, so I worked quickly.”Alexander Joe worked for over three decades as a wire photographer.

The strike will disrupt waste collection and trains, buses and trams, as well as schools, museums and pharmacies.Raggi urged the unions on Tuesday to cancel the strike “for the good of the city”, arguing that its citizens did not deserve the ensuing mayhem.With opposition politicians and residents calling for her to resign, as well as criticism from members of her own party, frustration over the city’s management is mounting.Massimo Tabacchiera, president of the Lazio unit of Confapi, the union representing small and medium industrial companies, said the strike originated from “a city that is tired and lacks perspective”. He added: “There has never been a plan for Rome and this administration continues to navigate only by undertaking small measures and neglecting every long-term infrastructure project.”Both the Democratic party and the far-right League have launched separate petitions seeking Raggi’s resignation. The League’s leader, Matteo Salvini, said 10,000 people had signed its petition within a few days.Rome’s residents have organised a “passive march” along the Tiber river on Saturday morning under the slogan “enough of Raggi”. The protest comes exactly a year after thousands demonstrated outside the local authority to decry the city’s scruffy condition. “Raggi’s administration has transformed the city into one to escape from instead of one that enables us to live with dignity,” the organisers wrote on a flyer advertising the protest.Some of Raggi’s initiatives have had a positive response, including introducing an Uber bike-sharing scheme, and recycling machines at three underground stations that people can use to exchange plastic bottles for metro tickets.Until recently, she continued to be backed by the party, but Vincenzo Spadafora, M5S’s minister of sport, admitted this week the administration of Rome had been “difficult” and that the whole party should take responsibility. Barbara Lezzi, an M5S senator, defended Raggi, arguing that she had “inherited the destruction that all other parties had committed over the course of decades”.Neither Raggi or her spokesperson were available for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d38c951d6cd88fa783d0ea8700da18a01ea95d4/0_399_5954_3573/master/5954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e535e14cc37223b74a69a6127155b40d","title":"venice tourist kidnaps currency exchange worker rates","story":"Woman reportedly held hostage in latest incident involving visitors to Italian cityA tourist is facing charges of kidnapping after allegedly holding a worker hostage at a bureau de change in Venice in a row over exchange rates.The man is reported to have been unhappy with the amount in euros he received in exchange for $100.The 46-year-old, believed to be from Israel, tried to cancel the exchange at the agency close to Rialto Bridge before allegedly closing the shutters and preventing the woman from leaving her booth.The woman’s ordeal lasted about half an hour. She managed to call the police who arrested the customer. The woman was reported to be “dismayed and frightened”.The incident is the latest claim of a tourist behaving badly in the lagoon city. In September a gondolier was headbutted and punched in the face by a man from South America after clashing over a selfie. The tourist had boarded a moored vessel to take a selfie with his family and became aggressive after the gondolier told him to either get out of the boat or pay for a ride.Venice authorities are imposing much harsher penalties on delinquent tourists, with two Czech visitors recently fined €3,000 for “obscene acts” when they were caught skinny-dipping in a canal close to St Mark’s Square.In June, two German tourists were fined €1,000 and asked to leave the city after being caught preparing coffee with a camping stove on Rialto Bridge. The pair had violated one of the city’s “urban decorum” rules, which include bans on snacking on bridges and the steps of monuments and swimming or dipping toes in canals."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot understand how they can say I am at fault.

Once the HSE is satisfied with the water quality, the notice will be lifted.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is due to audit the plant on Thursday afternoon. Problems were detected at around 11am on Tuesday. After hours of testing by the EPA and the HSE, a decision was eventually taken at 4.40pm to issue a boil water notice.The Leixlip plant supplies water to homes, schools and businesses across most of north Dublin city and the Fingal administrative area of north county Dublin, parts of southwest Dublin and parts of counties Meath and Kildare.“This morning, during a meeting with the HSE we reviewed the test results and the impact of the boil water notice. At the forefront of all discussions was the need to protect human health and that is why the boil water notice will stay in place for now,” Irish Water customer strategy manager Yvonne Harris said on Wednesday.Leixlip Treatment plantIrish Water said the initial problem that compromised the disinfectant process of water at the Leixlip Treatment plant on Tuesday has been repaired.However, the utility said untreated water probably remained in some 20 per cent of the network.The HSE said there was a danger that untreated water in the network may contain cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia. These may cause gastrointestinal infections with symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It advised people who develop such symptoms to consult their general practitioners for testing and treatment.Irish Water warned there may be “residual” untreated water in the network for several days, as treated water flushes the system.Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by a microscopic parasite (Cryptosporidium). Once an animal or person is infected, the parasite lives in the intestine and passes in the stool.Giardiasis is a form of gastroenteritis, characterised by diarrhoeal illness that is caused by a microscopic parasite, Giardia lamblia.Irish Water said it was contacting all registered vulnerable customers who are affected by this boil-water notice to advise them.It has asked anyone with queries to contact Irish Water on its helpline (1850 278 278) or to check its website (water.ie) for updates."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergObjections by French president Emmanuel Macron have delayed efforts by Donald Tusk, who heads the European Council of European Union leaders, to secure agreement on a three-month Brexit extension for the UK.Mr Tusk spoke to EU leaders in recent days – including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday – in an effort to secure unanimous agreement to grant the UK an extension until January 31st.However, sources in Brussels and Dublin say Mr Macron is unwilling to wave through the extension.EU ambassadors met last night in Brussels but did not agree to the UK’s request. It is believed that the French government does not favour a three-month extension unless the UK commits to an election or a second referendum. However, it would be willing to agree a short extension of a few weeks to enable the British parliament to complete ratification of the treaty.StatementIn a statement to The , the Elysée Palace said the British parliament “should examine the withdrawal agreement as quickly as possible”.“We will see at the end of the week if a purely technical extension of a few days is necessary, to complete this parliamentary procedure,” it said. “Apart from these circumstances, an extension that is intended to gain time or to rediscuss the accord is excluded. We concluded an agreement and now it must be carried out without delay.”Other EU states, including Ireland, are worried that a short extension could result in the UK crashing out without a deal. In the Dáil yesterday, Mr Varadkar said he favoured a long extension that would also allow the UK to leave as soon as the withdrawal agreement is ratified.If there is no agreement in the coming days among EU leaders, they are likely to be summoned to Brussels for an emergency summit next week. Mr Varadkar said yesterday that his “bags are . . . packed” for such a gathering.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRelatives carry the coffin bearing the remains of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco at the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum near El Escorial, Spain, on Thursday. Photograph: Juan Carlos HidalgoAPCries of “long live Franco!” accompanied the coffin of Francisco Franco on Thursday as Spain removed the remains of its former dictator from the state mausoleum where he was buried in 1975.His exhumation and reburial is the most significant move in years by Spanish authorities to lay the ghost of the general whose legacy still ides the country he dominated for nearly four decades.The ruling Socialist Party, which faces a national election next month, has long sought to move Franco’s remains from the huge monument, built on his orders and containing the remains of combatants from both sides of the 1936-39 civil war.As crowds of media and onlookers gathered outside, Franco’s coffin was extracted from its tomb in the Valley of the Fallen in a ceremony witnessed only by relatives and a small group of officials.The coffin was carried to a waiting hearse and then transferred to a helicopter for the short fight to a private family vault in the Mingorrubio cemetery north of Madrid, where Franco will be reburied next to his wife.Members of his family had sought a court order to try to prevent the exhumation.The reburial “should make us reflect on what it means for our country’s own image and for democracy,” said acting deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo. “Young people should understand that we can never again be without democracy.”About 500,000 people were killed in the war between Franco’s nationalist rebels, backed by Hitler and Mussolini, and left-wing Republicans. Franco then ruled Spain as an autocrat until his death.Media blackoutSeeking to play down its repercussions, the government had enforced a media blackout and forbidden Franco’s family from draping his coffin in the Spanish flag.But in a gesture of solidarity with his ancestor, his eldest grandson and namesake Francis\u0026nbspFranco carried a Franco-era nationalist flag into the valley mausoleum for a ceremony that highlighted deep political and social isions.A poll in newspaper El Mundo this month showed 43 per cent of Spaniards favoured the transfer of Franco’s remains while 32.5 per cent opposed it.In an interview on Wednesday, Francis Franco accused the government of engineering the exhumation “as propaganda and political publicity to win a handful of votes before an election”.Albert Rivera, whose centre-right Ciudadanos party abstained in the parliamentary vote to ratify the coffin’s transfer, said on Thursday that almost two-thirds of Spaniards had not lived or suffered under Franco.But the dictator’s burial alongside his victims has long raised critical questions among historians and campaigners, including 93-year-old Nicolas Sánchez-Albornoz."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

His grandfather had pulled his ­Toyota Yaris on to the hard shoulder in search of safety shortly before the ­devastating impact.However, his company, part-owned by the Government, had not investigated the dangers of removing the hard shoulder, before then dodging a question about whether he would feel safer in an emergency pulling up on a live lane or on a hard shoulder. His staff had worked out that more than 26 motorists a day stop in live lanes.Earlier this year, the  established that four stranded motorists were killed in just 10 months on just a 16-miles stretch of the M1 where the hard shoulder had been turned into a fourth lane. They were all forced to pull over on the former hard shoulder having failed to reach an emergency refuge area, a layby shielded from traffic, before being hit by oncoming traffic. A number of relatives of those who died spoke to the  about their concerns that the rising death toll was being ignored. Claire Mercer is demanding a judicial review to try establish whether smart motorways are safe or notYesterday, Claire Mercer, 43, whose husband, Jason, was among those killed on the M1, said Mr Shapp’s intervention was a “step in the right direction”.“But the government must not fall into the same trap as Highways England by burying their heads in the sand,” she said.“Mr Shapps must ensure he puts an end to this madness.” Dynamic smart motorways | How they workMeera Naran, whose eight-year-old son, Dev, was killed when the car he was in had to stop on a M6 live lane hard shoulder, said: “Highways England needs to be more open and transparent about fatalities. “Lives and safety should always come before cost. It is tragic that people have been dying on these motorways and Highways has not been reviewing fatalities to see what lessons can be learned.”Dilesh Naran and his wife, Meera, lost their son, Dev, when the car he was in pulled over on the hard shoulder being hit by a lorryEdmund King, the AA President, said “We are delighted that the Transport Secretary has listened to us and agreed to review the safety of ‘smart’ motorways.“We have been raising concerns for more than six years about the dangers of the 38 per cent who breakdown in a live lane on smart motorways. We hope the review will stop a further rollout unless more Emergency Refuge Areas are planned and retrofitted.“We trust that the review will not get overtaken by misleading or partial statistical analysis about what type of road is safer but will concentrate on avoidable deaths. We know there are real situations where lives would have saved if drivers on smart motorways had somewhere safe to stop. We owe it to all drivers to give them a safe harbour to stop if their vehicle develops problems.”Dynamic smart motorways | How they workTracey Crouch, a Conservative MP who has questioned whether smart motorways are safer than conventional ones, said she she delighted the Transport Secretary had listed to concerns about smart motorways.It is important that he drills down into some of the statistics so that stop comparing fatalities from those who have broken down on a smart motorway with those caused by other factors on a normal motorway.This news will be welcome not just by the families of those who have lost loved ones on a smart motorway but everyone who has ever broken down and feared for their safety.Department for TransportThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Only British Gas would be larger.Any interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) watchdog said on Thursday.Ovo, founded a decade ago, has consistently been rated the best energy supplier by comparison site uSwitch. It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.Energy firms face crackdown after string of suppliers go bustEnergy firms ordered to pay £15m green taxes or face losing licencesThe acquisition of SSE’s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.Competition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.However, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.The latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto’s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.Despite the greater competition – as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 – more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.gas and electricity\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.Tesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new “gigafactory” in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.Following the news on Wednesday, Tesla’s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.“Tesla nails it at last,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.Tesla’s cheapest electric car wins top prize at industry awardsPolice abandon chase after Tesla electric patrol car runs out of powerElon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberBut Mr Wilson added: “In one sense, we shouldn’t get too excited”, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.Tesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.SUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.Tesla’s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its “Smart Summon” feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.US federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.Mr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.The company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s.

Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery.

The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean.

Though quantum computing could bring profound new processing power to the world, it is also incredibly complicated both to understand and to test.The milestone is revealed in a new paper that has been long-rumoured but is now finally published in the prestigious journal\u0026nbspNature. And the world is finally scrutinising what exactly Google means by quantum supremacy, whether its claim stand up – and what happens now.Here is everything you need to know about the breakthrough.The phrase, first coined in 2012, refers to something very specific but a little complicated to define. It is the moment at which a quantum computer is able to do something that a classical computer could not.Reaching that point would be significant because it would seem to prove the promise that scientists have been making for decades: that an entirely new kind of computer could be created that would allow for wholly fresh – and vastly improved – ways of dealing with data. That, in turn, could revolutionise the world.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.\u0026nbspBut it is important to note that it is also only a milestone: the real journey is much longer, and there is an awful lot left to do. Scientists are excited about the possibility of achieving quantum supremacy because of what it means about the process of creating really useful quantum computers, not necessarily as an end in itself.The phrase is also disputed for many reasons. Researchers including John Preskill, who first coined the phrase, have noted that it can give unnecessary hype around our understanding of quantum computers, and that it has an unfortunate echo of white supremacy.What\u0027s more, the very importance of the test is disputed, too. That\u0027s in part because it is difficult\u0026nbspto say exactly when quantum supremacy has been reached, because researchers could discover that any given process was actually possible to complete on a classical computer all along.To understand how a quantum computer works, it\u0027s important first to understand how a traditional one works. Everything from the phone in your pocket to the computer in your desk – and all the other places that computers appear – do so using the paradigm of classic computing, which has stayed strong for years but which quantum computers could compete with, if not displace.In a traditional computer, everything in the memory is represented as a series of bits, which work as a binary system: they are either 1 or 0, on or off. Those bits can be assembled into the vast and complex information processing systems that we use every day, by stringing them together and analysing the data they together represent.A quantum computer works instead with qubits, not bits – they are no longer binary, but instead can be in a number of different states. By exploiting the unusual behaviour described in quantum mechanics, scientists are able to build quantum computers, which operate at that more complex and therefore more powerful level.Just as in a traditional computer, those qubits can be assembled into a system and used to carry out operations. In a quantum computer, that is made up of a series of quantum gates, which can in turn be assembled into a quantum circuit.That – or a vastly longer, almost impossibly more complex version of that –\u0026nbspis how we get to a quantum computer, which is able to exploit those various strange phenomena and use them to run operations.Theoretically, those quantum computers and their entirely new paradigm should allow scientists to conduct those operations more quickly and in new ways. It\u0027s that which leads us to quantum superiority – and to the variety of other possibilities that lie after it.Google\u0027s great achievement – and it is certainly not the only company to try – is to boil down that complexity into a functioning quantum computer. The successful chip wasn\u0027t the first of Google\u0027s experiments, and there are more likely to come or probably already being used already, but it is the one that will go down in history as perhaps achieving the first great landmark in quantum computing.The Sycamore chip is a 54-qubit processor. That is relatively limited, and is one of the many reasons that the discovery is not practically useful – researchers want a 100-qubit or even 200-qubit system before they are really able to put it to the test, and see whether the dreams of quantum computing are realised.But the big breakthrough is just how high-fidelity and fast the gates that make up the computer are. Scientists have lauded the precision with which the system works, and it is that which allowed Google to make its announcement.The actual process that it did to prove its quantum supremacy was relatively simple in output: it just gave out random numbers. But it was the workings behind it that were such a breakthrough, since it used an algorithm that would take 10,000 years to give a similar output on a classical computer, but only 200 seconds on Google\u0027s Sycamore.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They went on to find the places in the universe where these are found – with the exception of one.This is the final stage of a decades-long chase to pin down the origin of the elements, said\u0026nbspthe study\u0027s lead author Darach Watson from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.We know now that the processes that created the elements happened mostly in ordinary stars, in supernova explosions, or in the outer layers of old stars. But, until now, we did not know the location of the final, undiscovered process, known as rapid neutron capture, that created the heavier elements in the periodic table.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe element that researchers saw being formed, strontium, is found naturally in the soil.

When they did, telescopes around the world turned towards its source: named\u0026nbspGW170817, it was a neutron star merger deep in space.If heavier elements were created when neutron stars collided, scientists thought they would be able to see evidence of them in\u0026nbspkilonovae, which are left behind from those mergers.It was looking in data taken at that time that researchers spotted the elements that were left behind.By reanalysing the 2017 data from the merger, we have now identified the signature of one heavy element in this fireball, strontium, proving that the collision of neutron stars creates this element in the Universe, said Watson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only British Gas would be larger.Any interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) watchdog said on Thursday.Ovo, founded a decade ago, has consistently been rated the best energy supplier by comparison site uSwitch. It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.Energy firms face crackdown after string of suppliers go bustEnergy firms ordered to pay £15m green taxes or face losing licencesThe acquisition of SSE’s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.Competition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.However, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.The latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto’s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.Despite the greater competition – as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 – more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.gas and electricity\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.Tesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new “gigafactory” in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.Following the news on Wednesday, Tesla’s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.“Tesla nails it at last,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.Tesla’s cheapest electric car wins top prize at industry awardsPolice abandon chase after Tesla electric patrol car runs out of powerElon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberBut Mr Wilson added: “In one sense, we shouldn’t get too excited”, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.Tesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.SUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.Tesla’s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its “Smart Summon” feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.US federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.Mr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.The company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Repeated measurements come out with a variety of different answers, puzzling the researchers who take them.Now the latest measurement has once again suggested that our understanding of the expansion of the universe is wrong. It used new methods to prove that the speed – known as the Hubble constant – is perhaps even more unusual than we had expected.The astronomers kept the results of the study secret even from themselves during the research, to ensure that they would not be swayed by just how strange their measurements could prove.In order to understand the expansion rate of the universe, astronomers led by\u0026nbspUniversity of California, Davis used Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspHubble Space Telescope alongside technologies on the ground. It was the first time that the latter equipment – the\u0026nbspWM\u0026nbspKeck Observatory’s Adaptive Optics (AO) system – has been used to mesure the Hubble constant.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 September“When I first started working on this problem more than 20 years ago, the available instrumentation limited the amount of useful data that you could get out of the observations,” said co-author Chris Fassnacht, Professor of Physics at UC Davis. “In this project, we are using Keck Observatory’s AO for the first time in the full analysis. I have felt for many years that AO observations could contribute a lot to this effort.”The results have been published in the latest issue of\u0026nbspthe Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.To ensure that the results were reliable, the researchers went into the research blind: ensuring that they kept the final conclusions hidden as they worked to ensure their measurement was as accurate as possible. That meant that the researchers could avoid the worry that they would unconsciously adjust the findings to ensure that they lined up with expectations.“When we thought that we had taken care of all possible problems with the analysis, we\u0026nbspunblind\u0026nbspthe answer with the rule that we have to publish whatever value that we find, even if it’s crazy. It’s always a tense and exciting moment,” said\u0026nbsplead author Geoff Chen, a graduate student at the UC Davis Physics Department.When they finally looked at the result, they found that the numbers showed the universe is expanding more quickly than they had thought.That in turn could complicate our understanding of the universe under the standard model of cosmology. Researchers generally think that the expansion of the universe was very quick when it first formed, then slowed down as dark matter pulled on it, and is now getting faster because of dark energy.That was created by looking at very distant objects, looking into the cosmic microwave background or the radiation that is leftover from the Big Bang whent he universe began.But the new study looks at more local objects. Numerous studies have found that there is an unexplained difference between the speed measured from those local objects and the results found when examining distant ones.“Therein lies the crisis in cosmology,” says\u0026nbspFassnacht. “While the Hubble Constant is constant everywhere in space at a given time, it is not constant in time. So, when we are comparing the Hubble Constants that come out of various techniques, we are comparing the early universe (using distant observations) vs. the late, more modern part of the universe (using local, nearby observations).”That suggests either that there is a problem with our understanding of the Cosmic Microwave Background – which researchers think is unlikely – or that there is something profound and fundamental wrong with our understanding of physics.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters. HWCalderon\u0027s play is one of the masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age. The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters.

For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"labour brexit caroline flint","story":"But amidst all this deceit, one senior Labour figure has stood out for her heroic determination to honour the referendum verdict.Caroline Flint, the long-serving MP for Don Valley in Yorkshire, was among the six brave Labour rebels who backed the Prime Minister in the crucial vote on Saturday.And she was certainly the most impressive of this courageous band, distinguished not only by her record as a former Minister but also her willingness to speak out in defiance of her party’s stance.At the last General Election in , Labour promised to “respect the result of the referendum.” But since, they have done everything they can to undermine that historic decision.The Commons may have become the House of Cowards in blocking Brexit, but Flint is a shining beacon of valour.In the Westminster debate at the weekend, she made two powerful interventions.First, she denounced the procedural manoeuvres which “have only one motivation and that is to delay and stop Brexit.”Then she attacked the argument, much used by her Labour colleagues, that the EU is the ultimateagainst workplace exploitation.Pointing to the growth in zero hours contracts, she declared, “when it comes to workers’ rights, the EU is not God.”She followed this up yesterday with a newspaper article, in which she pointed that for deprived communities in her Yorkshire constituency, “the European Union was not for them. More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”.

Civil servants have warned that a later date could force schools to cancel nativity plays to act as polling stations.It means that the next  hours are crucial in how Brexit and a general election plays out.EU ambassadors met last night to try to find a compromise and take stock of the lay of the land.Mr Varadkar has backed a three-month flextension which could be ended earlyMPs ratied the deal before January .But he suggested other leaders disagreed with him, saying: “My bags are always packed for Brussels and packed they are again.”Mrs Merkel also confirmed she would not block another delay, with her spokesman saying it would “not fail due to Germany”.But her country’s foreign minister Heiko Maas said the UK would need to provide assurances it would hold an election to get the full three months.He said: “If it’s a question of pushing Brexit back until the end of January, we’d need to know why. What’s going to happen in the interval and will there be elections in Great Britain ”French President Emmanuel Macron has taken a tougher line still, with his Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin saying the UK should only get a few days to pass the deal.Privately, French officials said the president wanted any extension capped at  days.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “It all hinges on Johnson explaining his plans. If he can’t convince leaders, we’ll need a summit.”Mr Johnson faces a battle to avoid losing on the Queen’s Speech today.He is operating without a majority in the Commons, with just  MPs taking the Conservative whip —  short of the number needed to ensure victory.Losing the Queen’s Speech would traditionally be seen as a no confidence vote and force a PM to quit.Under recent rule changes, the vote is only symbolic — but losing will still be embarrassing.There was also fresh confusion over what checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the new deal.At PMQs Mr Johnson insisted there would be no checks but this was contradicted by his spokesman and Home Office officials.Border Force Official Paul Lincoln told the Home Affairs committee that minimal electronic submissions would be needed for goods going from Great Britain to Northern ­Ireland.And on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay admitted Northern Irish businesses moving some goods to Great Britain would require exit summary declarations.Tory MP Michael Fabricant stormed: “Jeremy Corbyn knows that he is even less popular than Michael Foot, so is running scared of an election.”MYSTERY surrounds the fate of the p Brexit coins after MPs wrecked the timetable to leave.At least , have reportedly been pressed already, and may be collectors’ items.Though the Queen doing a facepalm, right, would surely be more appropriate.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They don’t filter at all.Scientists have also argued that filters are not just a pointless marketing gimmick, they are actively harmful.In particular, the harmful components of smoke arent captured by the filters.Meanwhile, the website of the Jerome Adams, the US Surgeon General, says: Evidence suggests that ventilated filters may have contributed to higher risks of lung cancer by enabling smokers to inhale more vigorously, thereby drawing carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke more deeply into lung tissue.On top of this, cigarette fillers are a major source of plastic pollution and the greatest single item of litter found in the world.This is because they are made from a type of plastic known as cellulose acetate that does not easily biodegrade.Every year . trillion butts are littered globally and they take ten years to degrade.Environmentalists now want them to be viewed similarly to plastic straws.And a team of scientists wrote in the BMJ: Even though the cellulose acetate filter is the single most commonly collected item of litter globally, the industry has largely succeeded in avoiding the public outrage expressed towards plastic waste.Unlike manufacturers of some other polluting post-consumption waste products, such as refrigerators containing fluorocarbons, it has never been held accountable for the cost of the waste it generates..

Consider your dietIs your after-dinner cigarette your favourite  A US study revealed that some foods, including meat, make cigarettes more satisfying. Others, including cheese, fruit and vegetables, make cigarettes taste terrible. So swap your usual steak or burger for a veggie pizza instead..

Little Michael Labuschagne was rushed to hospital seven months ago when he woke up gasping for air after suffering a cardiac arrest. The now ten-month-old was then put into an induced coma and his parents were told it was likely he would never wake. Against the odds, Michael, from Bristol, awoke when doctors reduced his sedation - opening his eyes and smiling at his dad, Stuart. But that happy moment was quickly tempered by the news that there was a high chance the boy had suffered brain damage. Luckily, a scan revealed that this wasnapost the case. However, Stuart and mum Emma were then delivered the hammer blow that Michael had an extraordinarily rare heart tumour which would need expensive surgery to fix.  Now his desperate mum is trying to raise nearly £, so her sick baby can travel to the USA for an operation after doctors found an incredibly rare tumour - in his HEART. Michaelaposs parents were told he had a cardiac fibroma attached to the septum within the left chamber of his heart - which only a handful of patients have ever been diagnosed with. There is no long-term solution offered on the NHS but Michaelaposs parents discovered a hospital in Boston, USA which can remove the tumour. They now need to raise a staggering £, so he can be cured - and ideally within six months. Mum-of-three Emma, , said: At  weeks and three days old he went to bed like any other baby. But at am he had suffered heart failure.  Words cannot begin to describe the pain we felt in that moment. We watched our baby breathless, gasping for air while his heart stopped and paramedics worked to save his le. In that moment I did not think Michael would make it through. Yet I am so so blessed to be here telling you that he survived. He survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest which only seven per cent patients do. Michael was fitted with a pacemaker after waking up from the coma, which unfortunately restricts the totaposs movement. Currently, he is unable to sit up or support his own head.

Friends have said the trucker, named locally as -year-old Mo Robinson, raised the alarm himself after finding the victims - all Chinese nationals - dead inside the refrigerated container. Robinson, from Portadown in Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and was still in custody for questioning today. It was announced shortly before pm that the police had obtained a warrant to hold Robinson for a further  hours. The victims were found dead in Grays, Essex, shortly after the trailer was picked up at a port on the River Thames after arriving from Belgium. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror  A friend claimed Robinson was innocent, telling MailOnline:wouldn’t have known those people were in the back. Apparently he’d parked up at the industrial estate in Essex and had gone to fetch the paperwork from a pocket on the inside of the lorry door. When he opened the container up and saw all the dead bodies, he was absolutely horried - as anyone would be - and called the ambulance service who in turn alerted the police. One witness claimed the Northern Irish driver had passed out after opening the refrigerator unit and discovering the bodies, the Evening Standard reported, although that suggestion remains unveried. Sources told theit is very unlikely Robinson knew about any alleged plans to smuggle migrants into the UK. Police were investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring, the report claimed.  Neighbours told Irish media that Robinsonaposs parents had left their home in Laurelvale, Co Armagh, and had already travelled to England to support their son. Paul Berry, a local councillor who knows the parents, said Robinsonaposs father found out about his sonaposs arrest through social media. The bodies of  men and eight women were discovered inside the container at an industrial estate in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday morning. It is feared they all froze to death inside the trailer where temperatures are said to get as low as -C.  Officers have started the grim job of removing the bodies from the lorry and the painstaking task of trying to identy them. It is believed the stowaways had been inside for more than  hours by the time they were found dead. Police probing one of the UKaposs biggest murder inquiries continued to question Robinson - whose girlfriend is said to be expecting twins - on Thursday. Officers have also raided three properties in Northern Ireland. It is believed Robinson - who called his truck the Polar Express - picked up the trailer two hours before the migrants were found dead.  The trailer had entered England via a freight ferry service from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet, Essex, on the River Thames. Belgian authorities said the container arrived at Zeebrugge at .pm local time on Tuesday and left the Belgian port the same afternoon. The ferry docked in Essex just after .am on Wednesday and the lorry left the port in Purfleet about  minutes later. The tractor that hauled it away from the port had come from from Northern Ireland, entering the UK via Holyhead on Sunday on a ferry from Dublin, according to police. It had Ireland emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message The Ultimate Dream.  On social media, Robinson had dubbed his cab the Polar Express. The Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna in Bulgaria under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. Paramedics were alerted first after the bodies were discovered at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, and Essex Police were notied just after .am. Police moved the lorry to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered. Belgiumaposs federal prosecutoraposs office has launched its own investigation to find out where the trailer originated and how long it had been in the country.

I told them before I was going to have to put some particularly pointed questions. But I think the reality I found was just a couple who just seemed a bit bruised and vulnerable. I think with mental health, you have to be very careful what words you use but that was the story I found and it seemed the right journalistic thing to do, to tell that story as empathetically as I could.    You know as well as I do as a journalist, there are dferent moments and that just felt like the approach I should take on this occasion. The documentary has caused a huge debate around the world, with many praising the couple for speaking so honestly about subjects not normally addressed by members of the royal family. But others have criticised them for moaning from such a place of privilege, especially while in a country like South Africa. Insiders claim William and other members of the royal family are extremely worried about Meghan and Harry after seeing the show, adding that the breakdown in the brothersapos relationship was desperately sad.    They said: They’re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling. “It seems the boy who walked behind their mother’s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation’s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy.

Prince Charles, his sons William and Harry and their wives Camilla, the Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan Markle often sit in the front cars or carriages while those further down the line of success are behind.But according to Prince Edward, the Queenaposs youngest son, there is a huge benefit to this - and he much prefers it.Speaking during a TV interview, he said: Without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best entertainments is being in the car behind the Queen’s car, because that’s where you see all the reactions – especially in places where they’re not expecting to see the Queen , that’s even better.   His we Sophie adds: And we open the window just a little bit, so we can hear what people are saying. Edward also opened up about his first ever royal engagement, saying he was given absolutely no instruction whatsoever of what he actually needed to do. His parents the Queen and Prince Philip walked off ahead, leaving him and his brother Prince Andrew behind. He said: I remember vividly the awful realisation that we were going to have to walk through this corridor of people because the cars – I couldn’t even see the cars, they were around the corner – and our parents just walked off and started talking to people.    And I thought: aposWell, I can either walk down the middle like a complete lemon or…apos I think my brother was there as well, so we just said: aposYou go that side, I’ll go this sideapos, but there was absolutely no instruction whatsoever.

So don’t start shaking hands, because once you have shaken one person’s hand you are completely stuck – you have to shake everybody’s hand.    While he avoids shaking hands on walkabouts, the Earl does of course shake hands at official events and while meeting important figures.Despite not being very senior when it comes to the family structure, the Queen is said to be very close to Sophie and enjoys her company.

Chanelle Urquhart took the drastic decision to undergo aposchemical menopauseapos in a bid to end months of horric pain caused by endometriosis. The process will see the woman from Hull injected with hormones that stop ovulation and menstruation. After being diagnosed with the condition, which causes the lining of the womb to grow across internal organs, last year, Chanelle says aposswitching offapos her hormones has been completely worth it. The bartender first went through the menopause aged  but chose to have further treatment this year in a bid to stop the production of oestrogen.    She said: “The pains in my stomach were constant and it felt like there was a tiny person inside my stomach who was swinging a kne around. “Endometriosis began taking over my le, I had to defer my second year at university studying biomedical science because of my mental health, the pain and I had my operation coming up to remove part of my cervix as severe abnormal cells were found on my first smear. “Depression and anxiety come hand in hand with endometriosis as the pain is unbelievable and you’re constantly worrying about what is going to happen next. “It felt a bit weird going through the menopause at such a young age because it is usually older women, but it stopped my period which is a huge relief. “The first time I was given an induced menopause by a monthly injection was two years ago, but it affected my mood more than ever. “This year in April, I was given a nasal spray that induces the menopause which is much better because I can look after my mental health and stop spraying it each monthI feel the same as last time.    “I do get hot flushes and extreme memory loss but at least my iron levels are back up and I’m not bed bound.” The severity of endometriosis began when Chanelle started her periods at  but she was dismissed by doctors and says she was made to feel as though she was ‘exaggerating’. She was forced to take a daily cocktail of painkillers including Tramadol in a bid to reduce her lower abdomen, leg and back pain. She adds: “I have spent most of my le going back and forth from the doctors who made me feel like I was going insane as they said it is ‘period pains’ and a few have said it was an STI. “The results would always come back negative and I always knew there was something wrong, but I started to think maybe they’re right and I am being a hypochondriac.    “I was finally taken seriously when I got into my twenties and I have had two laparoscopy’s with excision of endometriosis - a surgical procedure, enabling them to see my organs and remove what they can. “But as it took so long, they discovered the endometriosis had spread to my bowel, womb, oies and all over my pelvic wall. “I also had blood filled cysts in my oies that would burst up to once a month and I imagine the pain would be like someone pouring acid over my organs, thankfully the endometriosis has since been removed via surgery.

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier lured their pal Payton Leutner to a sleepover and then an outdoor play session on May , . Motivated by a fear for the mythical character Slender Man, the two -year-olds then stabbed their friend  times, leaving her for dead as they fled the scene. Thankfully Payton survived the vicious attack, although she has been left with lelong physical and emotional scars. More than five years on from the attack and as Morgan and Anissa serve their  years and  years prison sentences respectively, one of the first police officers on the case has recalled questioning the girls.    Detective Tom Casey sat down with the friends at the Wisconsin police station shortly after the stabbing. I mean, sheaposs at a police department and sheaposs covered in blood and…[itaposs as ] this is like a normal day for her, he said of Morgan in an ABC   programme. When the detective asked the girls whether Payton was dead or alive, they didnapost seem concerned about her condition. I might as well just say it. We were trying to kill her, Morgan said, Detective Casey recalled. I figured that Iaposd get into trouble eventually, though, because mommy always says that whatever you do catches up to you eventually, and it did.    Anissa went on to tell Detective Michelle Trussoni how she had become afraid of Slender Man - a tall, suited character without a face - through a website that collects horror stories. She became convinced the ghostly figure was real after seeing him, she believed, while on a bus ride. The girl told Detective Trussoni that it was really scary to think that Slender Man could kill her whole family in three seconds. All pupils at the same school, Morgan and Anissa thought they had come up with the plan for the perfect murder.    They had invited Payton to a sleepover and originally planned to stab her that night - but couldnapost go through with it. Instead, the following day, they grabbed a kitchen kne from home and set off for the woods. After playing for some time, they started a game of hide and seek and when Payton was crouching down, they pounced. She was pinned down and as she stabbed her friend multiple times in a frenzied attack, Geyser shouted: Don’t be afraid. I’m only a little kitty cat. Before the girls fled the scene they told Payton they were going to get help. In her police interview Anissa said: So, we told her we we’re gonna get help, but we really weren’t. We were going to run and let her - pass away.    After she was found and rushed to hospital by ambulance, Payton told police the shocking story of what had happened to her. Horried detectives then launched a search to find the two missing girls. Morgan and Anissa had set off to the Nicolet National Forest, where they believed Slender Manaposs castle was located.

Instead of splashing the cash, some couples decide to buy cheaper ones or craft unique rings themselves out of sentimental items for a low-budget alternative. And while a lot of people have no qualms about being proposed to with a homemade trinket, it seems thereaposs one thing many people would really hate to receive.Let it be known that the people of social media, and surely all sane people out there, draw the line at an engagement ring made from a manaposs fingernail clippings.Yes, it seems one man really spent an entire year collecting his nail clippings to turn into a diamond ring.   The whole process was shared on Twitter in a disturbing viral video by SCMP News. The South China Morning Post reported that a Japanese man, who creates videos on YouTube under the name Kiwami Japan, collected his fingernail clippings for  days and filmed the process of them being turned into a piece of jewellery.Once he had collected a sufficient amount of clippings, the man started by putting them into a blender. However, this didnapost give the desired consistency, so he then ground them into a very fine powder, before mixing with water in a pan.    The fourth step saw him compress the nail powder and water mixture and put it into an oven for  minutes. What came out of the oven can only be described as looking like a lump of dark clay. The man took the mixture and put it into a diamond-shaped mould before inserting it into a silver ring - which he also made himself. When all was done, the finished product was a ring with a dull black stone, which thankfully looked nothing like fingernails.    SCMP Newsapos video has been watched over , times and had hundreds of likes and shares. Many people were disgusted by the footage, even going as far as to brand it hell. One person commented: The f*** did I just watch  Another joked: Nothing says romance quite like ground up fingernails. A third said: Thataposs nasty bruh. Someone  added: Thataposs just flat out gross.

The killers poured kerosene over -year-old Nusrat Jahan and set her on fire on the roof of her school in April. She died five days later in Dhaka hospital following the horric attack. The teenager had claimed the head of her religious school in Feni, Bangladesh had attempted to rape her. Police said in their charge-sheet the murder was carried out on the orders of the principal Siraj-Ud-Doula.    All  men had been on trial following the death of Nusrat on Wednesday, April , which sparked protests across the country against oppression of women and girls. The case took  days and was overseen by Feni Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunal Judge Mamunur Rashid. The court was told Nusrat had gone to the school to sit her exams. She heard one of the witnesses to her sexual assault had been taken to the roof to be beaten, so she rushed there to help. Four people with their faces covered then held her and poured the kerosene on her, and when she again refused to withdraw her complaint, she was set alight. Shahadat Hossain Shamim, a senior student, got involved in the attack because Nusrat had earlier refused his proposal for a relationship, police said.  Nusrat’s classmates Saur Rahman Mohammad Zobair, Kamrun Nahar Moni, Poppy and Jabed directly took part in the arson attack on the rooftop, according to the law enforcers. Poppy, a niece of Siraj, called and followed Nusrat to the rooftop, while Umme Sultana Poppy pinned the victim down by her neck. Shakhawat Hossain Jabed doused her with kerosene and set her alight with a matchstick, police said citing their statements. The judgement proves that no one is above the law, public prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters after the court verdict. He said the defence lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to establish that Jahan had committed suicide. Defence lawyer Giasuddin Nannu said his clients will challenge the verdict in the High Court. Jahanaposs death sparked public outrage and mass demonstrations calling for her killers to be punished. She had faced pressure to withdraw a complaint to police in March accusing the school principal of attempted rape, her family said.    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had met her family and vowed to bring the killers to justice. I canapost forget her for a moment. I still feel the pain that she went through, mother Shirin Akhtar said as she burst into tears at her home following the verdict. Jahanaposs brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman, demanded that the death sentences be carried out swtly and sought protection for his family against reprisals. We live in fear. We were threatened even today in the courtroom, Noman said.

This means they are without a win in their last five league matches.Speaking after Saturday’s - defeat against Coventry, Stars coach Omar Pacha said: “The positives are we played better defensively but we didn’t have that spark offensively or the jump we usually have.”Following Sunday’s loss, the Canadian mentioned how defensive mistakes cost his team late in the game and how frustrating it is to be on the wrong side of controversial calls.Blaze held a - lead after the first period as Evan Bloodoff capitalised on a Dundee turnover in the eighth minute.However, when both teams went down to four skaters each in the second period, Kevin Dufour put Stars back on level terms as he went clean through on the Coventry goal and dispatched the puck through the legs of Jamie Phillips on the halfway mark.The West Midlands club nicked the two points in the final period as Alex Forbes scored a shorthanded goal in the th minute.Yesterday, Stars were in Yorkshire where they were beaten - by Sheffield Steelers.The scoring was opened when Dundee’s captain Matt Marquardt was in the penalty box for slashing. On the resulting powerplay, Marc-Olivier Vallerand fired a shot into the top-left corner after  minutes.Robert Dowd quickly doubled Steelers’ lead as he batted in the rebound of Ben O’Connor’s shot a minute later.However, the goal was reviewed for a high-stick foul but, after a lot of deliberation, the call on the ice stood, much to the Stars boss Pacha’s frustration.Aaron Fox’s men were in top gear and added a third goal in the th minute as Tanner Eberle pulled the puck around a charging Leclerc and tucked it into the Stars net as he was taken down by the Dundee goaltender.Sheffield held onto their three-goal cushion going into the first break but, early in the second period, the visitors hit back to cut the deficit to - as Brett Stovin was on hand to turn in the rebound of Jagger Dirk’s blocked shot.Pacha’s men were on top for most of the second session and, in the third, Stars closed in again.While on the powerplay, Dundee’s Elgin Pearce pulled one back to make it - on  minutes.The Canadian forward was in space and picked out by Anthony Beauregard before he released a quick shot that flew past Duba and deflected down off the crossbar.The Tayside team were only within one goal of the Steelmen for five minutes as Sheffield restored their two-goal lead after  minutes.Steelers’ Eric Meland released a fast and low shot that hit the leg of Eberle and that was enough to deflect the puck past Leclerc, making it -.Despite Dundee going all out in the final few minutes, the home side held on to claim a - home win.Dundee’s next matches see them face another tough test with a trip to Belfast Giants on Friday night before a home clash against Glasgow Clan on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy. Engagement with local groups, which has been an important part of the councilrsquos support in delivering the lsquoVision for Haddington Town Centrersquo, is ongoing and we look forward to setting out more details in the months ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyford-bluebell-players-fantastic-experience-soccer","story":"The county sextet were in the studio throughout the show, which went out live on Sky Sports at .am.The players for the amateur team ndash captain Daniel Howie, Jordan McCallion and brothers Jack and Shaun Moffat ndash along with friends Darren Hall and Lewis Brown, took part in the volley challenge and pro am questions to win cash.They travelled by train to London last Friday evening, with Sky covering all travel and hotel costs, as well as taxi fares to and from the studio.The trip came about after Soccer AM posted on Twitter that it was looking for Scotland fans to appear on the show.After an email from Daniel and a couple of phone calls later, the trains were booked from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kingrsquos Cross as the members of the Musselburgh Tartan Army headed south.

When askedthere was a new Scottish independence referendum tomorrow should Scotland stay in the UK, .% said Remain, with .% plumping for Leave with around % either undecided or refused to register a decision.Last week, Scotlands first minister insisted that a legal referendum is the only way for the country to win independence.She dismissed claims that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in a general election would be enough for independence to be declared.There was \"no easy or shortcut route to independence\" and that a future referendum had to be \"beyond any doubt in terms of its legitimacy\".:Ian Blackford says Scottish independence vote has to happen next yearBut she insisted that independence was now closer than ever.She has repeatedly said she wants to hold a second referendum on independence next year - but the move has been ruled out by the UK government.The latest Survation poll of , people aged over  in Scotland also revealed some % agree that Brexit makes independence more likely - showing no change from March.When Scots were askedthe UK leaves the EU without a deal, would they be more likely to vote for independence in a future referendum, % agreed in that latest poll, up from % in March.According to the latest poll, more than half of Scotsthink there will be another vote on independence within the next two years -arise from the % who believed that in March.The Survation polls on support or otherwise for Scottish independence for Progress Scotland did not seek a straight Remain or Leave option. Instead, voters were asked to provide a depth of feeling about independence or staying part of the Union using a scale from zero to ten.The analysisfalls more in line with the Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times Scotland which last weekfound support for Scottish independence had risen to %.The % figure backing independence marks a five point increase on the % Panelbase registered on average in its polls last year, which mirrored the % yes % no result of the  independence referendum.Angus Robertson, the former leader of the SNPs Westminister group in Parliament, who is the managing director of Progress Scotland, said after some of thelatestpoll results were producedon its website: ldquoThese poll results show that Brexit is having a major impact on general public opinion on the timing of a second independence referendum, and particularly on swing voters who are open-minded or undecided on Scottish independence.ldquoA clear majority believe that Brexit makes Scottish independence more likely and that their views have changed about Scottish independence.\"The Press Association previously reported that the Progress Scotland poll showed that Scots are \"more likely to have shted towards remaining part of the UK rather than backing Scottish independence\".Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins had said when the original figures - that came without the March comparisons - were revealed: \"Its no wonder these independence campaigners want to keep the results of this poll quiet.\"Progress Scotland arent usually slow to trumpet their findings so its interesting that theyve been so secretive about this particular survey.\"Like the vast majority of polls, it reveals again that more Scots want to remain in the UK than to leave it.\"And, far from gaining momentum, it seems the Yes campaign is losing supporters at a higher rate than its gaining them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A happy day for equality  but a sad day for the Union","story":"The reason for breaking the shameful deadlock that has put democracy on hold for three years was not to pick up business where they left off, nor to attempt to bridge the irreconcilable gulf between warring parties, but to block one of the most signicant pieces of legislation to be passed in Belfast in years.Pro-choice campaigners, and hundreds of thousands of women across the country, won a victory on Monday.

Those whose homes, jobs, benefits, health or welfare services have been hurt by Brexit will not want to risk things getting worse ndash they will want detail and plans. The SNP cannot provide a case for Scotland leaving the UK.This is not down to the competence or skills of the SNP but down to the simple fact that the whole UK economy will be in the midst of a huge change. There wold be no stable baseline to start from because so much will be dependent on negotiations taking place or deals being finalised.Campaigning at that time for Scotland to leave the UK would be an uphill battle with the very real chance of severe economic upheaval should they succeed.Ms Sturgeon has used up her \"resets\" for the timetable to independence. The SNP membership and the wider Yes movement are already frustrated by her preication. The only way out of this dilemma is for the SNP to replace Ms Sturgeon with a new leader who can clear the decks and build anew.Michael Kent, Gfnock.DAVID J Crawfords letterbrought a smile to my face. The SNP immediately ignored the democratic will of the Scottish people in  despite its \"assurances\" at the time. Ever since, it has constantly pursued independence to the detriment of effective government. He also states separatists are in the majority. Where  In his own head presumably.Jim Mitchell, Carluke.WHEN Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons that the Scottish Parliament has no say on Brexit issues, despite the fact that legislative consent is required in respect of devolved issues, it sums up the UK Establishmentrsquos lack of respect for Scotland.Far from Brexit being a piece of cake compared to independence negotiations, any future orce talks between the UK and an independent Scotland would focus on very dferent set of issues than Brexit as there would be no equivalent to the Northern Irish backstop issue and the continuation of the Common Travel Areawith Ireland under the Brexit deal suggests that would also continue in the case of an independent Scotland.Beginning with the United States, a total of  countries have left London rule and only three have ever voted to stay: Northern Ireland in , Bermuda in  and Scotland in . None of those who left Westminster rule, including Malta, which has more say over Brexit than Scotland, has ever asked toor regretted leaving and most have prospered, as do all the small self-governing nations in western Europe.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.I WAS a little surprised to read that there was consideration given to recalling the Scottish Parliament from its autumn recess to discuss the Brexit crisis .I didnrsquot realise they were on holiday considering they had just ed from their summer holidays in September. They managed a mere five weeks before they felt the need of another break.By Jove, they were up in arms about Westminster proroguing but they donrsquot need to bother with that there is always another holiday round the corner.Considering the state of education, the NHS, and the economy, not to mention Brexit, you would think  weeks annual vacation is grossly excessive, especially when you consider that most normal folk have to do with four or five weeks.I keep reading about politicians needing more respect. Well, how about starting by cutting back on holidays and try working a bit harder Ian McNair, Cellardyke.Read more: Recalling Holyrood will fuel demands for Scottish independence"},{"url":null,"title":"can-applaud-news-cinderella-now-man","story":"Now, Irsquove discovered my chance to see such creatures this year will be lessened Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre has announced a women-only panto, Cinderfella, prompting a surge of disappointment that the rather awesome talents of great Dame Johnny McKnight and Wicked Queen Darren Brownlie wonrsquot be on display.But the loss of those actors apart, is the move to an all-female cast a positive one  Is there a point to this conceit of removing men ndash and will the panto be improved thanks to the gender positive discrimination And why would you want to subvert a comedy form that is already deliciously subversive Panto has long been a wonderful world of gender fluidity men have long played women, women have played Peter Pans and Principal Boys who fall in love with women. The blurring of sexual demarcation lines has long offered young eyes, often visiting a theatre for the first time, the awareness that anybody can play anybody who can fall in love with anyone.Yet,males are removed from the line-up the fear is panto becomes less about the battle between Good versus Evil, about love conquering all, and more about tick-box sexual politics.Panto queen Elaine C. Smith however reckons the removal of the Y chromosome from the line up to be immensely positive ldquoConsidering the only picture for a century or more has been of menin panto then itrsquos a great way to balance things. Edinburgh is all-male as ever, Aberdeen, again men led, and across the UK not much has changed. Itrsquos generally men who are musical directors, and writing, directing and designing pantos.Itrsquos perhaps no surprise the progressive Tron Theatre has moved in this direction. Writer director performer Johnny McKnightrsquos previous panto Mother Goose featured a same sex love story, and it was not only appropriate for the times, it was a very funny panto. Last year, an all-female cast enjoyed a runaway success with the fabulous Pride and Prejudice , featuring five females wearing frocks and Doc Martins and sometimes moustaches. Yet, Austenrsquos story was one of the battle of the sexes, exploring the very dferent sensibilities. And the Tron conceit of a woman, for example, playing a wet-shirted, stuff-shirted Darcy, offered huge comedic value.But panto isnrsquot nearly so complex. What we all want is Aladdin to get the better of Abanazar and get off with the Princess , or for Cinders to show her sisters therersquos no point in cutting off your toes to spite your face.Yet, therersquos another question thrown up by the move to remove men. If male actors donrsquot get the chance to play Uglies, is this a de facto political statement saying itrsquos now wrong to laugh at a butch man in a dress  Is Dick Emery dead to us The Tronrsquos version of the Uglies will see two women play daft men instead. That may be funny, but consider this: panto has long been moving away from the Principal Boy being played by a women, with some feminist groups saying the character objecties women.Butthe new Cinderella sees women send up masculinity, is this not equally wrong And had this all-female casting policy been around in the past fty years we would have been denied the drag talents of the likes of Stanley Baxter, Rikki Fulton and Jack Milroyand Johnny Beattie. Wersquod have shut the door to the great campery of performers such as Gerard Kelly, Allan Stewart and John Barrowman.And what of the future  If we become too positive in our discrimination are we denying a Frankie Boyle or a Kevin Bridges, should they fancy,a stint in a frock Whatrsquos undeniable is any professional theatre which announced an all-male panto cast would be bombarded with something heavier than fake custard pies.There is little doubt the Tron panto has an excellent line-up in the likes of Sally Reid, Hannah Jarrett-Scottand Jo Freer. There is little doubt Johnny McKnight is an exceptionally clever writer. But Irsquod rather he was putting on the lip gloss and appearing alongside the great line-up of women. For therersquos a worry hersquos denying the opportunity for wide-eyed little Johnnys out there to become the role model hersquos become."},{"url":null,"title":"liverpool-fans-travel-ghent-instead-genk-champions-league-match","story":"Rob, from London, and Lee, from Leicester, only realised their mistake half an hour before the match was due to start.It forced them to instead watch the game in an Irish cafe in a city more than two hours by train from the one they had intended to visit.Rob told the PA news agency: ldquoWe are really embarrassed.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA community-led scheme to turn a disused schoolhouse into affordable rented housing in North Ronaldsay has been named as a finalist in a national competition.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s a recurring theme: once parliamentarians actually know what it is they’re being asked to vote for, they’re suddenly less enthusiastic.The cruellest irony is that the architect of Mr Johnson’s humiliation – Sir Oliver, who was thrown out of the parliamentary Conservative Party for rebelling to stop a no-deal Brexit – voted with the government.But Mr Johnson lost the second vote on the timetable for the legislation because MPs didn’t trust his commitments on workers rights and environmental protections, and wouldn’t tolerate sending the bill on a break-neck, two day sprint through the Commons.A signicant delayThe result is that a signicant delay is all but guaranteed, and a winter election seems inevitable. Once the Letwin amendment was passed, Mr Johnson was forced to ask for a delay until at least  January under the terms of the Benn Act. His petulant gesture of sending one unsigned letter, and two more saying he didn’t want a delay, gave Downing Street the headlines it wanted but had no practical impact.Likewise, appeals from Brexiteers for EU leaders to veto an extension have been ignored. Viktor Orban, the Eurosceptic strongman prime minister of Hungary, and French President Emmanuel Macron, whose frustration at the endlessness of Brexit distraction for Europe, were touted as leading candidates to block a delay. But neither are willing to further disrupt the EU by undermining unity on Brexit. The consensus is to allow a delay, which could be confirmed as early as tomorrow.What then  It depends how long the delay is for – but again, the EU is expected to stick to the script. The French government would like to see pressure on MPs ramped up with a short extension. It made the same case when Theresa May put in the request for a delay in Spring and lost the argument – with Macron largely vindicated by the way events have unfolded.General electionBut his stock has fallen with France’s objections to EU enlargement in the Balkans, and circumstances in the UK have also changed – the deal now on offer is less advantageous for all sides, the deadlock in parliament has deepened, and the sense that a general election is the only way out is felt in Brussels as much as London. Leaving space for that to happen is in everyone’s interests.Confirmation of a  January extension removes that last excuse for the opposition to hold off on voting for a general election. With Labour trailing the Tories in the polls by  per cent or more, and Labour MPs fearful of either being seen to have blocked Brexit or going into an election with Jeremy Corbyn as leader – or both – it’s understandable why enthusiasm is limited. In Scotland, among all parties, there is also little excitement at the prospect of a campaign fought in the freezing cold, snow and rain, and many hours of darkness. Turnout could be low, benefitting the most energised – the SNP and the Lib Dems.As Mr Johnson himself said in the Commons – there can’t be much more of this. The government doesn’t want its Brexit deal amended out of recognition by the opposition. His advisor Dominic Cummings wants his people versus parliament campaign. The country and the continent need an escape.The answer is close at hand.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence voters switching to support the union","story":"The Progress Scotland survey found  per cent of voters ldquocompletely support Scotland staying part of the UK, compared with  per cent who ldquocompletely support Scotland becoming independent.Read more: Poll: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos push for election out of step with ScotsThe Survation poll was commissioned by Progress Scotland, headed by former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, and surveyed , Scots at the start of the month.It sought answers on a spectrum of - to identy strength of opinion on the issue, with  marking ldquocomplete support for staying in the UK, while  ldquocomplete support for independence.A narrow majoritywere more supportive of the Union, with  per cent in the middle and  per cent more supportive of independence.

This will, in turn, justy the privatisation of most government responsibilties and duties of care going to US companies where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA. It is not only this, but the tax payer will foot the bill for negotiating trade with the USA, where, as mentioned, it will be under the USA#s control, terms and conditions. The tax payer will also foot the bill for any trade deal arrangement where the USA will benefit immensely with a # forced to take it or leave it # scenario for the UK citizen.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Many of her previous publications topped the book charts in the UK and Ireland, some even making on to the prestigious Sunday Times Best Seller list.In her latest publication, the experienced cook s to her roots with wholesome recipes for easy and affordable meals to suit all occasions - from quick mid-week suppers to the traditional family Sunday lunch.For Jenny, food has come full circle, and her wisdom and advice over her long career has always reflected the needs and trends of society.Since the start of her illustrious career, which has seen her present pioneering television cooking shows, appear at events, establish her cookery school and publish extensively, her personal style has evolved and changed dramatically. Jenny describes her cooking style now as more relaxed and healthier, offering great results with less fuss. She has reflected this approach in her new recipes.Fundamentally, Jenny’s guiding principals have remained the same throughout her career. She wants to empower people to create tasty, wholesome food that brings everyone to the table with a smile on their face.“I have taken familiar recipes and updated them with a modern twist drawing on influences and tastes from the full spectrum of the global cuisine,” Jenny says.“There are few people who don’t appreciate the merits of a Sunday roast dinner, a slice of cake and warm, home-baked bread served with a bowl of soup.“My roots are in the country and in my new book I want people to connect with our world-class, local produce and enjoy the bounty of nature all around us while supporting and strengthening our food infrastructure.“I understand everyone is struggling in these uncertain times. We are all juggling busy schedules, domestic budgeting and a healthy diet, so I have created a collection of streamlined recipes for lighter, fresher dishes that are easy to prepare and heartwarmingly delicious and nutritious.”At Home With Jenny features food for all seasons from Valentine’s Day to Christmas and everything in between. It’s perfect for both novice and seasoned cooks with sections covering starters, mains, outdoor cooking and wonderfully tempting sweet treats.Jenny’s experience has taught her the strong connection between a positive, balanced diet and good physical and mental health. In this new book, she is keen to promote the whole experience of a healthy food lestyle.“Food is a great way to bring people together both formally and informally. I am encouraging people to make these dishes and sit down at the table with family and friends converse and enjoy the food. “Every meal is an occasion to connect and what better to do it than over food made with love,” Jenny says.At Home With Jenny features recipes for pizza, fish dishes, steak, casseroles, cakes, salads, and lots more. Seasonal dishes include sumptuous autumnal Roasted Bramley Apple and Pumpkin Soup, as well as warming Crusted Tart with Pulled Brisketand Filo topping - just perfect for winter days.Each dish in this collection has a strong connection to nature and landscape reflecting Jenny’s love of the outdoors which she pursues by surfing on the North Coast and sparking up outdoor cooking at every opportunity – even to make Christmas dinner!It has been four years since Jenny last published a book. In that time, she has been kept incredibly busy with her cookery school in Cullybackey, and appearing at events right across Northern Ireland.Jenny says: “Over the last few years, I have been out of the home kitchen and connecting with people from all walks of le. “This has afforded me a fantastic experience to discuss and find out directly what people actually want when it comes to cooking at home.“Recently, there has been a push-back against the relentless demands of digital technology. Many people find cooking a mindful way of relaxing while nourishing their minds, bodies and souls. People want simplicity and to be connected to how their food is sourced and prepared.“In my new book, I have carefully considered all the important contemporary food issues such as dietary requirements, time and finances and I have put together a simple guide to help everyone make healthy choices that satisfy your appetite for le!”Home With Jenny is available now from jenny@jennybristow and at book signing events throughout Ireland.It is priced at pound.

In the event that these programmes cannot be maintained, establishing comprehensive successor programmes is essential,” said Mr Crowe.The committee previously heard how communities along the border both north and south are lagging economically since  in stark contrast to strong economic growth and employment in other parts of Ireland and Northern Ireland.To tackle this, the committee recommends the promotion of the border region as alternatives to the Dublin area for Foreign Direct Investment the promotion of the three border regions as areas of national importance and the comprehensive upgrading of infrastructure, both transport and broadband, to assist connectivity in the region.It also recommends thatthe National Broadband Plan cannot be advanced further to deliver in its current format, an alternative solution is needed for the border region."},{"url":null,"title":"government contradictory on goods checks between northern ireland and gb","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms Patel has since written to the committee to clary the position within the Northern Ireland Protocol, confirming that administrative procedures including a declaration will be required when goods move from GB to Northern Ireland. Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “In the last three days, dferent senior members of the Government have said contradictory things about checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and the other way round. Home Office confirms there will be checks on goods between GB and Northern Ireland under Govt deal. @CommonsHomeAffs has just received this memorandum. The Home Secretary couldn’t answer this in committee yesterday pic RDabFqx— Yvette CooperOctober , “This is too important to be fudged. They need to be straight with people about what checks there will be.“From the Home Secretary’s letter, it is clear now that there will be checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland – but why could she and the Home Office not be clear about that yesterday at the committee  Those checks will have a signicant impact on Northern Ireland.“This makes it even more serious that the Prime Minister is trying to avoid scrutiny – both from the Liaison Committee and for his legislation in Parliament. You can’t hide something as important as this.” In written evidence, sent to the committee overnight after her appearance on Wednesday, Ms Patel said on the issue of goods moving from GB to Northern Ireland: “For the protection of the single regulatory zone and consumers on the island of Ireland, and to ensure that the correct tarfs are applied, we will need information on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. “Therefore, administrative procedures including a declaration will be required, which can be completed online.”On goods moving from Northern Ireland to GB, she wrote: “This deal explicitly allows the UK to ensure unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. “The UK does not therefore intend to carry out checks on such movements of goods. There will be a minimal administrative process which is designed to prevent, for example, trade in endangered species.” She added: “We will work with the EU to eliminate this limited process as soon as possible after Brexit.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  North Ireland Secretary Julian Smith insisted that checks will be minimal after Brexit, but was unable to give details Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay sought to reassure MPs and businesses about the nature of checks on goods between Northern Ireland and GB proposed in the new Brexit deal.He said it would be an “administrative process” which would involve “fairly straightforward data”.Mr Barclay claried comments made by Boris Johnson on Wednesday when he said there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB.“It is the case the Prime Minister was distinguishing between the paperwork that is required, which will be done digitally and is a single form, rather than actually introducing physical checks.“In the coming months, we will need to work both within the United Kingdom and with the European Union to discuss how to eliminate the limited and administrative processes,” Mr Barclay said.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds urged Mr Barclay to “take seriously” concerns raised by PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne, including warnings about the risk of loyalist violence.He said: “You are really in danger here of causing real problems with the Belfast Agreement, with the St Andrew’s Agreement, the political institutions and political stability in Northern Ireland by what you are doing to the unionist community.“Please wake up and realise what is happening here. We need to get our heads together here and look at a way forward that can solve this problem. Don’t plough ahead regardless, I urge you.”Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith insisted on Wednesday that checks will be minimal after Brexit, but he was to give any further detail.Mr Johnson has previously said fresh regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea would not happen on his watch.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said: “The Government is in complete disarray about the impact of its sell-out Brexit deal on Northern Ireland.“The Brexit Secretary says there will be border checks, the Prime Minister claims there won’t be, and the Home Secretary cannot say for sure one way or the other.“Boris Johnson should come to Parliament at the earliest opportunity to clary the Government’s position and apologise for misleading MPs about the consequences of his Brexit deal on trade within the UK.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

A meeting of the NI Affairs Committee heard evidence from Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and other government officials. During the evidence session Mr Smith acknowledged that poundm spent on MLA salaries since  is “unacceptable” when challenged by North Down MP Lady Hermon. It was also stated that relative trade flows set out in the impact assessment accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement Bill show that NI has a total trading bill of poundbn with GB, pound.bn with Ireland and pound.bn with the rest of the EU. googletag.cmd.push DUP MP Gregory Campbell therefore said trade on an East-West basis is “signicantly greater” than any other trade. He referred to a Treasury Select Committee meeting where it was mentioned that the current Brexit deal will result in administrative costs for businesses. “Can you understand that businesses will want more than a reassurance  On the other side of the equation people ask for and demand that it be written in stone, in a legislative process, because guarantees come and go and governments come and go, but the legislation is more dficult to change. “Do you understand why people would want to see that reassurance that you’ve given in the Bill ” The SoS said he does understand andthe Withdrawal Deal Bill was brought forward he would look to insert clauses to make “crystal clear” that the unfettered access commitment in relation to the flow of goods from GB to NI are laid down in law. He also said that he wants to work with every sector to minimise any challenges, adding that he sees it as a “huge opportunity” for businesses here. Labour MP Conor McGinn said unionists and nationalists have inevitably become ided on the constitutional issue of whether to have a land border on the island of Ireland or one down the Irish Sea. The St Helens North MP askedthe best way would be for the whole of the UK to be in a Customs Union with the EU. The SoS disagreed believing it would prevent the UK from striking trade deals with other countries and he feels the current deal offers the “best of both worlds” for NI. Mr McGinn put it to him that it is bad for NI to have either border. Julian Smith referred to his previous response to Gregory Campbell and sought to give assurances that there will be very little bureaucracy involved. Who made the “seismic” decision to switch policy from a border on the island to one down the Irish Sea , Mr McGinn asked. The complaint about the previous Bill was that NI would be trapped in a backstop, Mr Smith responded, and that has been done away with. He was then askedhe wished to apologise to unionists for making a promise that couldn’t be kept, but said he believes it has no impact on the constitutional position of NI or workings of the Assembly. Irish Language Act Speaking later at the meeting, East Derry MP Mr Campbell said that apart from Sinn Feacutein no other has put down an “absolute fundamental precondition” before they will go back into Stormont. In Mr Smith’s view there are a “number of issues” and he urged all parties to be “flexible”. “I understand the need for diplomacy but there is only one party saying we will not move until a pre-condition we have set arbitrarily is met and that’s Sinn Feacutein,” Mr Campbell remarked. He added that through amendments at Westminster one of their preconditions has been met and there was a “ludicrous and absurd” suggestion that the other one should be met, “the Irish Language Act”. The DUP MP said the British government has accepted this “blackmail” without asking for cross-community consent. He said either devolution is over or the rules have to be rewritten. Mr Smith responded: “There are absolutely no plans for the Irish Language Act coming from Westminster. Absolutely none. “On the issues of abortion and same sex marriage, these are devolved matters, they should be resolved in NI, the challenge I think there is, is that as the Assembly continues to be absent, no Executive, colleagues here at Westminster got frustrated and it was a free vote issue that went through.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The brown bear can call Ireland home again after a , year wait thanks to an Inishowen man with a big dream. This Friday, passionate wildle lover Killian McLaughlin will see his lelong dream of reintroducing some of Irelands extinct animals to their former natural habitat become a reality when the gates to his new sanctuary opens to the public. Built on a -acre site at Dundrain, Burnfoot, Wild Ireland has become home to three brown bears, three wolves, a lynx and other species of animals previously native to Ireland but now extinct here. googletag.cmd.push Among the  species of animals at the sanctuary includes a troop of Barbary Macaque monkeys.  Killian McLaughlin pictured with his wolves at the soon to be opened Wild Ireland animal sanctuary this weekend.  Speaking to the Derry Now, Killian said the purpose of Wild Ireland was to educate people on Irelands lost natural history, whilst giving a home to badly neglected animals. “If you go back thousands of years to when Ireland was covered in forest you would have found these animals roaming about,” Killian explained. “Due to humans, these creatures have been lost forever through hunting and deforestation. “What were trying to do here is to educate people that these animals belong here. We are quick to condemn other countries in Africa or Asia about the cruelty of hunting but we have already lost or native animals through hunting. “There are fossils of brown bears found in caves that show how many bears we had in Ireland thousands of years ago, the same goes for the lynx. “We have three wolves here and they only went extinct from Ireland in .” Working with several charities, Killian and his team rescued the animals from terrible conditions. “Working with Bears in Mind, we managed to persuade the Lithuanian government to give us the bears for rehoming. “They were kept in terrible conditions, they never even felt soil before, they were so used to concerte they were unsure of the ground but now they are beginning to be bears again. “We built them a three-metre deep pool so they can submerge themselves, before that the deepest water they had known was in their water dish,” Killian said. Despite being a full time job in itself, Killian has to juggle his work at the sanctuary with his day-job of being a solicitor. “Its been full on,” Killian laughed. “But I love what were doing here. Its so rewarding to see these animals have a chance of a new le.” Wild Ireland opens this weekend, on Friday, October , and will be open daily from am to pm, with last admission every day at pm, costing only € per adult and € per child.

Danielle Doherty and Emma Bradley received hearftelt congratulations from across the city when photos of them at ious city centre landmarks appeared on social media on the day of their wedding. The couple also revealed that a photo of them taken at Free Derry Corner was their way of acknowledging the battle for civil rights for all at the iconic monument. googletag.cmd.push At midnight on Monday, same-sex marriage legislation in Northern Ireland fell into line with England, Scotland and Wales after Westminster enacted the laws in the continuing absence of Stormont. Same-sex marriage was recognised in the Republic of Ireland in May  after a referendum decreed a change in the constitution that marriage was legal irrespective of the gender of the partners. Danielle told the Derry News: “Having a wedding in the North wasnt an option. It wasnt anything I wanted to do, because I didnt want a civil partnership, I wanted a marriage. Im Irish, I live in Ireland and so I wanted to get married here, and it was legal here, so we went to Donegal. “I think a civil partnership made it seem that what we had was less important – it undermined the whole relationship. And, Emma said: “We didnt even consider looking at venues in the North, we werent interestedit wasnt a marriage. I thought why should other people be allowed to marrythey are in love  Why are we any dferent  We had to border hop to be treated the same. “When Danielle proposed she didnt ask will you be my civil partner, she asked will you marry me  Asked what the couple thought of the situation where it took the intervention of Westminster legislation to equalise laws on same sex marriage with England. Scotland and Wales, Danielle told the Derry News: “It just seemed asa small minority of people, the DUP, used this to keep themselves in power somehow. Its just baffling that such people exist who have such backward views about the whole thing. But, we would have never waited until it was implemented here before we got married. It was never going to stop us. Emma added: “The rest of the world is moving forward, but it seemed that Northern Ireland was just stuck in the s or s and wasnt moving forward with the rest of the UK or Ireland. I dont care whether it was Westminster or Stormont who brought the changes in the law about. It doesnt bother me how it got in. I think it needed to be taken outside of here because it needed that extra push. Up until a few days ago we were married in the south of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales but not in our own country. We were only civil partners here.” Danielle said: “For the wedding we decided to do things unconventionally. For a start, we chose to get married on Friday th, because we both consider ourselves to be pretty unlucky,” she laughed. “We got ready together in the morning and had our hair and make-up done together. We went for photos around Derry before the ceremony. “We went to Free Derry Corner and the Museum of Free Derry, the Craft Village and into Peadar ODonnells and poured pints. We love Derry, and ideally yes, it would have been lovely to have got married in Derry but because of the laws it wasnt an option. So we got photos at landmarks that people would know and after that went done to Rockhill House in Letterkenny and got married there. “We had a spiritualist of Ireland ceremony so it was all legal because we couldnt get a registrar in time. And the reception was at Rockhill House that evening. I think we enjoyed it more because we got to spend the whole day together,” Danielle continued. Emma added: “If we had done things traditionally, we wouldnt have seen each other until .pm that day.” The couple admit that getting a wedding picture taken at Free Derry Corner was a purposeful move given the monuments iconic association with the civil rights movement over the last  years. “For me it was. Whenever we met with our photographer she wanted to know where we wanted pictures taken. The first thing we said was Free Derry Corner,” said Danielle. Emma said: “Free Derry Corner, to me is about it being called Free Derry – its about being who you want and doing what you want. People lost their lives for civil rights and we were making a stand that we deserve civil rights as well.” Both women said they had anticipated receiving a few derogatory comments and stares whilst making their way around the Bogside but in fact were overwhelmed by the kind responses of all they encountered, especially after some of the images were posted on social media. “I wasnt really expecting the feedback that it got. We were doing it for us, for our personal reasons.Then seeing the comments on Facebook of people appreciating us taking a stand for our civil rights was great. “When we got off the ten hour flight going on honeymoon and checked our phones, there were hundreds of shares and likes on the phptos that the photographer Lisa Byrne had put up. It was unexpected. Were just two wee girls from Derry that wanted to get married,” said Danielle. The Derry News also askedthe couple have ever felt let down by the political system despite regularly exercising their votes. Emma said: “Personally, sometimes Ive wondered what I am voting for. I have the right to vote and I will use it, but at the end of the day,theres nobody that speaks to me then Im really going to have to consider who I vote for. Danielle added: “There is no Stormont obviously, but thats got to with larger factors. The DUP said no to same-sex marriage and werent willing to compromise. They are obsessed with being part of the UK, but they dont want all of the UKs laws.” So, what were the thoughts when same-sex marriage passed into law in Northern Ireland earlier this week  “My thoughts were, thanks, but weve done it already. You are too late. It doesnt change that me and Danielle are married, but I am happy for the people that spent years fighting for this. We could have been people who said we are not going to get married until it was legal here. But it was legal in this country, you just had to go over the border to get it. But, its a positive thing thats happened. “Anybody in our situation who have struggled with their sexuality have felt dferent and felt that they didnt belong. The solution comes with years of trying to love yourself and trying to accept yourself and realise that you are a person and youre ok to be who you want to be. “I think for teenagers now and people who are coming out younger and younger, it is still dficult to deal with in top of all the other adolescent problems they have to go through. Danielle added: “It was going to happen eventually. It had to go down that road, it was just a matter of when. It couldnt be put off forever. Its great for future generations in that they can be themselves now. Its more acceptable now, its not that big social taboo anymore. Things have progressed a lot. “Were really fortunate with our families, our parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who have all be really supportive.” Emma concluded: “I would never deny Danielle, or who you are to me, or my sexuality to anyone. If people dont like it, thats tough.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Dungiven-born GAA was the latest interviewee of Dion Fanning, who runs the Ireland Unfiltered Podcast for Joe.ie.The episode, released on Tuesday, was recorded in Derry. Speaking about the city, Brolly said that he had “always had great affection for” the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness. He told a story about McGuinness arriving at the Brolly home when Joe was around six or seven to be “driven across the border.” “I knew Martin for a long time. Martin used to be a visitor at our house when he was a young man,” Brolly said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember my mother putting a  beard on him and, as I recall, the story was that he was going to university and he was my older brother.” He went on to say that McGuinness appeared to have a profound effect on former DUP leader Peter Robinson but that Robinson was “destroyed by the loonies” within his party.  The late Martin McGuinness  He said that he believedSinn Feacutein and the DUP had worked together they could have “attracted money from all over the world” to the north, but this could not happen as “in the end, the DUP is about narrow self-interest.” “I dont think the DUP care about other people. I dont think that people like Sammy Wilson or Gregory Campbell have any concern for their fellow man,” he said. Brolly also spoke about encountering DUP leader Arlene Foster as a young man in Belfast. “She was in the same class as I was and I always found it extraordinary that she was perpetually enraged. I mean, I never saw her when she wasnt enraged,” Brolly said. During the interview he also spoke about his childhood in Dungiven, attending boarding school in Armagh and his work with organ donation charities. He also praised the sense of community he experienced across Ireland with members of the GAA, which he contrasted with England, “a nation of strangers.” “The starting point for any civilised society is community, a sense of community for its own sake and for the sake of prosperity and a sense of empathy with your fellow man,” Brolly said. “What we still have here and why I evangelise so strongly about the GAA, is that the starting point of community is I know you. I dont know you, but I know you. So I gave a kidney to a guy – I didnt know who he was – but he was a GAA man and he had kids that played GAA, that was good enough for me.” Brolly donated his kidney to Shane Finnegan in , after the pair had worked together as coaches for St Brigids GAA club in Belfast. He said during his recovery his mother came in with “thousands and thousands and thousands of letters and messages and cards” from supporters and well-wishers. However due to his reputation as a GAA pundit meant that the messages were not all entirely complimentary, particularly one letter from Ballintubber, Co Mayo. “It started off like all the others. Congratulations on your magnicent gesture in donating a kidney to a fellow Gael. Any chance you could donate the other one ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ms Cusack said: Given that up to  per cent of women experiencing this natural transition are currently in work, many of whom are suffering silently due to fear or embarrassment, it’s time this issue was addressed openly.  I was shocked to see how little research has been done into this matter. The statistics I did read revealed how much the symptoms of menopause and peri menopause can negatively affect women in the workplace and how little assistance is provided by employers by means of understanding and support.  googletag.cmd.push The menopause can cause women to lose confidence in themselves through symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hot flushes, brain fog, exhaustion and much more, all resulting from the associated hormonal changes of the stage. This has caused many to feel overwhelmed enough to consider either cutting hours or stopping work completely. As a Council we can dictate and affect the policies of our organisation, therefore this is why, through a formal motion, I am asking for the introduction of supportive services for our staff. Given there is currently no legislation which requires a company to adopt a menopause policy, I am hoping this proposal,accepted, act as an example to other employers in our City and District and encourages many open conversations on a subject which has been too long ignored and avoided. Women are an incredible asset to any workforce and we should be doing everything in our power to enable and empower them to stay there.

The midfielder believes there are no excuses for the manner of Tuesday’s defeat to St. Patrick’s Athletic, which has all but ended the Candystripes’ hopes of finishing third and has put them under added pressure to get the one point they need against their Northwest rivals. City are still expected to get the job done against Harps but Tuesday’s defeat served as a timly warning that nothing is yet certain. googletag.cmd.push “It’s kind of hard to put your finger on it,” he said. “I’m surprised with ourselves given what was at stake that we didn’t kick on. It’s a disappointing night there’s no two ways about it and we’re disappointed with the result and we need to put that right on Friday night. “There are factors out of our control like we had a fixture on Saturday with a heavy pitch in Sligo but it’s not an excuse. We needed to bring more to the game and we didn’t and we’ve come out on the wrong side.” It all looked to be going City’s way when David Parkhouse gave them the lead in the early stages of the second half, but a quick equaliser from Chris Forrester plus two goals in three minutes from substitute James Doona meant that St. Pat’s gave themselves one more fighting chance of stealing fourth place from Derry City. “We expected to kick on and win the game from there but they score and get a bit of a momentum sht and the ball has fallen their way of the second goal and we are chasing the game,” Sloggett reflected. “No matter what stage of the season you’re at, when you lose a game you want the next game to come as quickly as possible and we’re lucky in that sense. We’ll freshen up and we’ll be ready to go and we’ll put another three points on the board hopefully.” Tuesday’s game was City’s second in four days after a break of , an inconsistency in the scheduling that has happened more than once this season. Again, however, Sloggett dismissed that as an excuse. “This is what the league decides,” he continued. “The international fixtures came at a strange time and this is the way that the games fell. We needed to deal with that but we’re disappointed with that. “We’ll have to go back and look at it and see where we went wrong and where we can make things better. They were good on the night and played with a lot of energy and we failed to match that. We can’t make excuses and we have to go and fix things.” After the celebrations at Sligo on Saturday past, it was widely expected that City would get the point they needed on Tuesday night to secure Europa League football at the Brandywell next season. The fact that they didn’t surprised many, but Sloggett dismissed suggestions of complacency. “I don’t think so,” he said. “I think we came with the intention to win the game because we were targeting that third spot. It’s out of our hands now but it’s still a possibility. I don’t think we came complacent. “We’re obviously very disappointed with our performance and not to have kicked on and won the game when we went - up but we have to put that right. “I think at the start of the season you would have taken a win in your last game to qualy for Europe and hopefully we can go and do that.”  Recognition Meanwhile, City striker David Parkhouse has been named in the PFAI Team of the Year and has also been nominated for the Young Player of the Year award.

That has to be the target,” he insisted. “There are six points up for grabs Bohemians are three ahead of us but I think we are two goals ahead of them now. We want to try and make six points upwe can but we know that’s extremely dficult but we’re at home and our home form has been good. “We are playing a team that is competing for Europe on Tuesday night and we need the fans, we need everyone in Derry to muster the effort and energy to come and support us because it would be brilliant and it could be a really good occasion. This is going to go to the last game no matter what andwe want to finish third orwe want to qualy for Europe then we have two games to win. googletag.cmd.push Unusual City’s winning goal was unusual to say the least but for Devine it was a case of his team making their own luck.“I think it started with our aggressive press,” he said. “It started with David Parkhouse pushing really hard to get down the line. Obviously it was a bit of fortune for us but Barry had to be in there, he had to be chasing the ball down. “It was a bit of fortune but over the course of the year we haven’t carried a lot of luck. We have been on the receiving end of some bad luck so we’ll take a win by any means tonight. It’s the first time as manager that I’ve won in Sligo so it’s a big win for me.”Devine and his players celebrated enthusiastically in front of the City fans at the final whistle and the manager admitted that the bond between both parties has been a key element of success this year.“It’s all about the fans,” he said. “You see the players’ response to the players and the players’ response to the fans. There’s a real feel about the club at the minute. People are spending money on a Saturday to come down here and we’re very grateful for that. “We’re very grateful of the crowds we’ve had in the Brandywell this year, we’re very grateful that when we’re - down after  minutes the fans aren’t turning on us and they keep encouraging us and keep singing. “It’s all about the fans, it’s all about getting this club back to where I believe it can go. “There will be nobody happier to see us land in Europe this year but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry City captain scored the winning goal against Sligo Rovers on Saturday night to pout his team on the verge of a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for a team which finished in eighth place in the Premier Division last year.A solitary point against St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell tomorrow night would seal the deal for Derry City and McNamee admitted that all focus is now on getting the job done. “We were watching the results on Friday night and saw that Pat’s slipped up a wee bit so and we spoke about that before the game because it was a good chance to put a gap between us,” he stated. “We need just one point now from the last two games so we’ll just focus on ourselves because we have a big game on Tuesday night again so it’s about getting ourselves right in the next two days. It’s a quick turnaround but we’ll be ready for it.”McNamee scored only his second goal of the season at Sligo to win Saturday night’s game after goalkeeper Ed McGinty hit it straight at the City captain as he attempted to clear it. For McNamee, it was just about being in the right place at the right time. “The ball was played back to the keeper and I went to put a wee bit of pressure on him but you don’t really expect anything to happen but he more or less kicked it straight at me and I just put the foot out and guided it in,” he explained.“People think I didn’t mean it but I don’t care. The team is going to come before how many goals I get. “This was a big goal which puts us a wee bit closer but whether it’s me or not it doesn’t really “We had a very sloppy start and again another slack goal was given away but credit to the boys again, all season there have been obstacles thrown at us and we’ve always answered. It was a big win and as Decky says, you don’t win too many games down here.”The Candy Stripes can still secure third place with home victories over St. Pat’s and Finn Harps this week with Declan Devine emphatic that his players give everything in these last two games, there should be plenty of entertainment at the Brandywell over the next few days. “Our aim is to win the last two games,” McNamee continued. “If Bohs win their last game it will go down to goal dference but we’re aiming for third place. “At the end of the day fourth place gets Europe so we have got to nail that down on Tuesday night andwe win that and beat Harps hopefully we’ll get third place as well. Obviously our objective is to finish third but next seasonwe’re playing in Europe no-one will careyou finish third or fourth. “The boys in there just don’t give up. You saw tonight again when we went behind we came back. Over the years at Derry whenever you went behind it wasn’t too often you came back again. “There’s a great character in the group and a never say die attitude and that’s all you can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point. However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South. Sadly these have been down for nearly three years, she said.The Baroness added: ldquoMy appointment to the House of Lords is an evolution. I was elected to Down Council in , was the organisationrsquos first female chairman, worked as MP Eddie McGradyrsquos parliamentary secretary, became an MLA and MP for South Down and a Minister in the Stormont administration.ldquoIt is now the House of Lords which represents a new challenge and an opportunity which I fully intend to grasp and embrace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Bid.jpg","title":"Bid for community centre in Crossgar  ","story":"A CALL has been made for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to keep the pressure on the Department for Communities to fund a new community centre in Crossgar.The village will be left without a building used to host a number community events when the Downpatrick Street property is sold.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area.

This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Cystic fibrosis drugs breakthrough: Hopes high for NI patientsHopes are high that a breakthrough new medicine for cystic fibrosis patients will be made available in Northern Ireland after it was given the green light by health bosses in England.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear.

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
