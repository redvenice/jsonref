In addition they are not telling the investors how many Airbus aircraft will easyJet go ahead and pay Airbus for and how much per aircraft during the next six months using UK taxpayers money.”He said he would write to regulators at the Financial Conduct Authority to try to force easyJet to disclose the details of what had been agreed with Airbus.Lundgren said that “we remain completely focused on improving short-term liquidity and reducing expenditure across the business”.Airbus has cut back its plane production to cope with lower demand, while airlines try to save cash as they go for months without revenue. The aircraft manufacturer usually produces more than 60 of its bestselling Airbus A320 every month at assembly lines in Toulouse and Hamburg, but said it would reduce that to 40."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1211b57c2b1fb0d1a32298300ed360eb6f79bced/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e02940d8551bc299cb84eada893a5f2","title":"imf chief flags up grim global economic forecast covid 19","story":"Kristalina Georgieva says Covid-19 pandemic has spawned ‘economic crisis like no other’The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that all but a handful of the organisation’s 189 member states will suffer falling standards of living this year as a result of the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s.Kristalina Georgieva said the sudden onset of the Covid-19 pandemic meant the IMF’s new forecasts for the world economy were going to be grim when released next week – and there was a risk that the impact could be even worse than currently expected. She said more than 170 countries will suffer a reversal of living standards in 2020. “Today we are confronted with a crisis like no other,” Georgieva said in a speech designed to set the scene for next week’s spring meeting of the IMF, being held virtually this year as a result of the pandemic.The IMF managing director said there was still “extraordinary uncertainty” about the depth and duration of a crisis that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. She added that it was already clear that global growth would turn sharply negative in 2020. “In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.“Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020. Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.”Georgieva said the crisis knew no geographic boundaries and the “bleak outlook” applied to advanced and developing economies alike. “Everybody hurts. Given the necessary containment measures to slow the spread of the virus, the world economy is taking a substantial hit.”She added, however, that the pandemic was likely to hit vulnerable countries hardest, adding that more than 90 nations had now sought help from the IMF in recent weeks following a fall in demand, more expensive borrowing and a drop in commodity prices.Capital flight from emerging market economies – seen as risky by investors during crises – had amounted to about $100bn (£80bn) in the last two months – more than three times the outflows seen during the financial crisis of 2008.Georgieva stressed the need for next week’s spring meeting to offer debt relief and to agree an increase in the IMF’s financial firepower so it could help more poor countries through the crisis.“Emerging markets and low-income nations – across Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia – are at high risk. With weaker health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums—where social distancing is hardly an option.”Despite the desire of governments to end the lockdown of their economies as quickly as possible, Georgieva said there was no trade-off between saving lives and saving livelihoods. Containment and the strengthening of health systems remained the first of the IMF’s four priorities.In addition, Georgieva said, governments needed to shield affected people and firms with large, timely, targeted fiscal and financial sector measures reduce stress to the financial system and avoid contagion and plan for recovery.The IMF boss said it was encouraging that governments had moved so quickly and that there had been significant co-ordination. Governments had agreed fiscal – tax and spending – measures amounting to $8tn, in addition to the massive stimulus provided by central banks.“There is no question that 2020 will be exceptionally difficult. If the pandemic fades in the second half of the year – thus allowing a gradual lifting of containment measures and reopening of the economy – our baseline assumption is for a partial recovery in 2021. But again, I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6ea2653656c8eebf607df920d980902d71c0c3/102_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f93afa0761ecb5dfc95b16def15ed445","title":"manager at major uk food supplier says staff who stay at home may be sacked","story":"Video at Bakkavor site shows boss threatening staff who are also seated less than 2m apartA boss at one of the largest suppliers of fresh food to UK supermarkets threatened to sack staff who stayed at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, a move that may have pressured vulnerable workers into shifts at a factory where social distancing has not been observed.Workers at a north London plant run by the food group Bakkavor, which supplies the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Waitrose, weretold they would be first in line for future redundancies if they missed work when they were not sick – even though some may have underlying health conditions or family members displaying symptoms.The comments were made during a presentation given last week to staff by Sean Madden, Bakkavor’s head of operations at its Elveden site, which was secretly filmed and then shared with the  and ITV News.Madden told workers that the pandemic meant the company was struggling because of falling orders and labour shortages, and suggested that the majority of people taking time off work were not suffering from the virus.The video, which clearly shows workers seated less than the two metres apart recommended by the government, depicts Madden telling staff: “If we need to get rid of 200 people’s jobs next month, I’m going to look at who turned up to work and I’m going to look at who didn’t bother turning up to work. The people who didn’t bother turning up to work, you know, they will be the first people that we have to get rid of, unfortunately.”The same messages were then repeated in Hindi for the benefit of workers who did not speak English. Bakkavor has since apologised and said that Madden is now on “leave”.Some workers have told the  and ITV News that they have felt under pressure to attend work at the Elveden site.A Bakkavor spokesman said: “We take this very seriously and are investigating the matter. We apologise to our Elveden staff for any miscommunication or worry caused. The manager in question has been given leave and prior to his return to work, he will undertake further training around his role and responsibilities and the high standards we expect of a Bakkavor manager.“Our advice to all our staff is to stay at home if they are feeling unwell or believe they have symptoms or if they are self-isolating due to members of their household displaying symptoms – points that were communicated at the staff briefing you have footage from.“We are saddened and concerned to hear today that a few colleagues feel under pressure to come to work and we’re putting protocols in place to speak to all staff at their next shift to make it absolutely clear that no colleague should come to work if they feel unwell, are self-isolating or if a family member is unwell.” Andre Marques, a London organiser at the GMB union, which has members on the Elveden site, said: “This behaviour is absolutely shocking. It is beyond unacceptable to threaten workers with the sack just for trying to keep themselves and their families safe.Bakkavor said that multi-tubes were just one measure in a range of “further controls” to make its sites safer, including the introduction of visors. It said it previously had in place “wide-ranging safety measures” and had not made, or had plans to make, any redundancies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4e319c760147399c22752190e20e8ab92e70f/0_265_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3abe0507e0fed6116bbcb76ba68c3707","title":"opec russia reduce oil production prop up prices","story":"Opec and its allies led by Russia agreed on Thursday to cut their oil output by more than a fifth and said they expected the United States and other producers to join in their effort to prop up prices hammered in the coronavirus crisis.An unprecedented 15m bpd cut still would not remove enough crude to stop the world’s storage facilities quickly filling up. And far from signalling any readiness to offer support, the US president, Donald Trump, has threatened Opec with sanctions if it does not fix the oil market’s problem of oversupply.Trump, who has said US output was already falling due to low prices, warned Riyadh it could face tariffs on its oil if it did not cut enough to help the US oil industry, whose higher costs have left it struggling with low prices.A White House aide said Trump had held a call with Russian president Vladimir Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia after a US official said the move by Opec+ sent an “important signal” to the market.Both Opec and Russian officials have said the scale of the crisis required involvement of all producers.“We are expecting other producers outside the Opec+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow, during G20,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s wealth fund and one of Moscow’s top oil negotiators, told Reuters.Thursday’s Opec+ talks will be followed by a call on Friday between energy ministers from the G20 major economies, hosted by Saudi Arabia. Brent oil prices, which hit an 18-year low last month, were around $32 a barrel on Thursday, half their level at the end of 2019. Sources said the cuts would be gradual, as the group seeks to overcome resistance from the United States, whose involvement they see as vital to a deal. US officials have already said output would fall naturally over two years.The United States, whose output has surged to surpass Saudi and Russian production since it began large-scale fracking, was invited to Thursday’s Opec+ talks, but it was not clear whether it had joined the video conference. Brazil, Norway and Canada were also invited.In a sign that Opec+ was struggling to win broader support, Canada’s main oil province, Alberta, said output had already dropped and that it had not been asked by Opec for more cuts. The province said it backed the US idea for tariffs on imported crude.

Rather than being paid for their outstanding holiday, the workers have been ordered to use it up during their notice period: a straightforward violation of the law. When their trade union, the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), asked the pub’s owners why the workers were being dismissed “despite having the ability to pay the wages and its bills after the government’s help package” and announced legal action, the only reply they received was “Noted”.What does he feel when we’re told “we’re all in this together”, I ask him. “I feel angry, it’s just not true,” Jhon tells me through a translator: he is a migrant worker from Colombia. “The owners of the hotels and the other businesses are only looking for profit, leaving everyone else unprotected. They don’t care about us.” He’s always been a responsible, loyal employee, he says, since he started working at the pub seven months ago. Now he feels angry, helpless, “shocked at the lack of humanity by these people at the top”, worried about rent, bills, and “simple things like buying food”.Coronavirus is not some grand leveller: it is an amplifier of existing inequalities, injustices and insecurities. We hear the constant invoking of the second world war: but despite the horror of Nazi bombs, the living standards and health of poorer Britons benefited from rationing and full employment. In the age of Covid-19, the rubble of economic collapse will fall on those who suffered the most from the last crash: the young, the precarious, the low-paid.If you are wealthy, you have savings you may own your property outright, or at least have relief in the form of a mortgage holiday. Renters on the other hand, who even in normal times part with a huge portion of their wage bills, now have the National Residential Landlords Association wagging its fingers in their faces, telling them that the pandemic is not a “green light” for them not to pay their rent. Many find themselves asking what exactly they’re meant to pay their rent with.As the Institute for Fiscal Studies notes, the better-off may actually increase their savings as spending on forbidden activities falls but poorer households spend much more of their limited income on necessities, leaving them vulnerable to sudden falls in their incomings. Indeed, millions who spend their lives treading water now face being sucked under by strong currents.The wealthy are also more likely to be able to work from home. In the United States, a study of mobile data reveals that the wealthy are moving around less than the least well-off: they can afford to self-isolate and did so quicker than their poorer fellow citizens. As the New York Times headline aptly put it: “Location Data Say It All: Staying at Home During Coronavirus Is a Luxury”. It is no different here, of course: while managers conduct high-powered meetings on Zoom, their cleaners still travel across cities on early-morning buses to clean half-empty offices.Then there’s the issue of space. While many middle-class children play in expansive gardens, much of the urban poor find themselves locked away in overcrowded accommodation, risking a police reprimand if they loiter around parks. Those with violent partners or abusive parents, or, for LGBTQ youth, all too often hostile families, have nowhere to go. For some, home is a sanctuary for others, it was a place of fear before the pandemic, and now it is a prison.Finally, nurses, care workers, bus drivers, supermarket workers are rightly designated the title of “key worker”, but what compensation for years of being undervalued, underpaid and now at particular risk of exposure to a potentially lethal illness.So save us the platitudes of coronavirus as the great leveller abandon this sickly myth that we are all in this together. For some, this is a time of grand inconvenience, of undoubted stress, of a self-evident loss of freedom. For others, this is both a national and personal disaster, a present defined by turmoil and of futures snatched away. The BBC’s Emily Maitlis was rightly lauded last night for debunking the myth that coronavirus is a great leveller. That it went viral shows the popular appetite there is not to whitewash our grotesque social inequalities. As the IWGB’s general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee put it in a letter to Jhon’s employers at Golden Brick Pubs: “History will look back on this moment, and those who had the means but nevertheless failed to do everything possible to assist and protect the most vulnerable, will be judged harshly.”When the pandemic is over, when a vaccine shields us from this cruel disease, the rich will still prosper, while the struggling and insecure will be expected to pay: they already are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/675f5c3327a7913bec6a6290261af78e7a5e9902/0_0_3058_1860/master/3058.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24cae7d3baf2a7e9f6e5cdced7d08d11 465w","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/669d023f8a762c57e7bdb18b674a40a4db94d857/0_164_2496_1498/master/2496..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49e9222928423a568112fe77e2fed41d","title":"bamboo rats left in limbo as breeders push back against china wildlife ban","story":"Farms forced to shut down operations as search continues for source of Covid-19 amid uncertainty over new industry rules Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province.It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says.But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China’s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai’s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over.China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak.“We hope to transition to other types of business but until it’s clear what to do with the rats, it’s easier said than done,” he said. “We would need funding and the right facility for that.”Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak.Certain types of bats and pangolins have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses.The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the  could find, which appears to be dated 2008, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats.“Somehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,” Yin said.Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the  on 3 April.“Of course, it’s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,” Yongcai said. “You don’t need to invest a lot, you don’t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.”Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China’s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen and the local government.But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade 230 families who went into breeding bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to £23,000 per operation.Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. “After the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,” he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he’ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful.Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn’t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he’ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production.“We’ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that’s just for the impoverished household breeders,” Yongcai said. “For regular breeders, we’re still on our own and awaiting a decision.”What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released.Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer.Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of African swine fever among China’s pig farms in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease.“I don’t think bamboo rats pose that big a threat,” he said. “Plus, there’s no conclusion yet on where the new coronavirus is from.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f53031009cc0ea635fc37a53985ba90f7e53d4/0_231_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12267bb063ed5ee1909e6747f65aa94a","title":"china signals end to dog meat consumption by humans","story":"Draft policy released by agriculture ministry cites concern over animal welfare and prevention of disease transmission as factors behind moveThe Chinese government has signalled an end to the human consumption of dogs, with the agriculture ministry today releasing a draft policy that would forbid canine meat.Citing the “progress of human civilisation” as well as growing public concern over animal welfare and prevention of disease transmission from animals to humans, China’s Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs singled out canines as forbidden in a draft “white list” of animals allowed to be raised for meat.The ministry called dogs a “special companion animal” and one not internationally recognised as livestock.The city of Shenzhen recently approved the first ever mainland China ban on consumption of dog and cat meat, a move that has given hope to animal welfare groups worldwide that other parts of the country could soon follow suit. The new draft policy has provided even more.While not officially a ban on the consumption of dog meat, the draft policy from the agriculture ministry could be a “game changer moment for animal welfare in China”, Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International (HSI) told the .“That signals a major shift, recognising that most people in China don’t eat dogs and cats and want an end to the theft of their companion animals for a meat trade that only a small percentage of the population indulge in,” Higgins said.HSI estimates that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at around 4 million per year.Most of these are stolen animals and not raised in captive breeding facilities, Higgins said.“Not only does it cause enormous animal suffering, but it is also almost entirely fuelled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera,” she said.The updated agriculture ministry list includes the addition of several wildlife species allowed to be farmed under animal husbandry laws if the policy is not altered following a public comment period that runs through May 8.Wildlife such as deer, game birds, along with mink, two kinds of foxes, and other animals were included on a list of animals expected to be approved as farm-raised species once China’s central government lifts a ban on the wildlife trade.The temporary wildlife trade ban was imposed from late January in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, largely thought to have originated in the formal or illicit wildlife supply chain.But campaigners hope the government will go still further. Peter Li, China Policy Specialist with HSI, told the : “Listing wild animals, including foxes and raccoon dogs, as ‘special livestock’ is concerning. Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn’t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments, their welfare needs simply can’t be met. In addition, there’s clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19, which is why we’re urging China and all governments to stop trading in wildlife.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1b93f92fba77c4af48e4c479ccfa3919197106/0_82_2642_1585/master/2642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8be3669f59578e72f8f0a06b0420bc2c","title":"coronavirus may prove boost for uks bees and rare wildflowers","story":"Populations could recover as verges are left uncut, setting what conservationists hope will be a long-term trendRare wildflowers and declining bee populations could start to recover during the coronavirus lockdown because many councils are leaving roadside verges uncut, according to Europe’s biggest conservation charity for wild plants.The respite for these mini-meadows is likely to lead to an explosion of colour in the countryside this summer and bring benefits to other pollinators, including butterflies, birds and bats, botanists at Plantlife said.Their potential role as conservation areas, however, is normally undermined each spring by local councils when they mow the roadsides. This cuts down many plants before they can flower and seed, leading to a steady decline of oxeye daisy, yellow rattle, wild carrot, meadow crane’s-bill, greater knapweed, white campion, burnet-saxifrage, betony, harebell and field scabious.Plantlife says this may be the best summer for years for these plants because several councils are redistributing resources to other activities as a result of the pandemic.Flintshire, Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Norfolk and Somerset are among the growing number of councils that are scaling back or delaying their verge mowing operations. Some local authorities, such as Devon, had already begun to accept that this should be done later and less frequently.Trevor Dines, Plantlife’s botanical specialist, said this could be a silver lining to the coronavirus crisis. “It’s a real opportunity for verges to flower again, some for the first time,” he said. “If the lockdown ends in late May, drivers will see great swaths of oxeye daisies and ladies bedstraw.”Grass near junctions and sight lines needs to be trimmed more regularly for safety reasons, but he said most stretches of road can be left until much later in the year so that motorists can see the benefits outweigh the risks. “Our message to councils is that if you haven’t cut verges until now then leave them until August and gauge the response from the public,” he said.Kate Petty, the group’s road verge campaign manager, said the extraordinary short-term circumstances of the pandemic could help to shift opinion and policies with long-term benefits for threatened species such as wood-calamint.“The fix is startlingly straightforward. Simply cutting verges less and later will save plants, money and reduce emissions. We need to rewild ourselves and accept nature’s wonderful ‘messiness’,” she said.Dines, who is also a beekeeper, said later and less frequent verge-mowing would help other species that depend on wildflowers.“This will certainly be good for pollinators. Last year, we already saw improvement in the areas where councils were cutting less. I had my best ever year for honey,” he said. “It’s also good for mental health. People are desperate for wildlife and colour right now. Let’s see what the public response is. For lots of commuters, myself included, verges are the only chance to see wild plants.”This year will almost certainly see much lower levels of wildlife roadkill. Past estimates suggest cars and trucks in the UK killed about 100,000 hedgehogs, 100,000 foxes, 50,000 badgers, 30,000 deer a year as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af44f49e5d3d666b954b2598071afbe801f34779/0_0_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4e7a5e698e5f816181631a5f0ecc65a","title":"the secret call of the wild how animals teach each other to survive aoe","story":"Cultural knowledge, passed from animal to animal, is key to how species adapt to change in the world around themSam Williams’ Macaw Recovery Network in Costa Rica rewilds captivity-hatched fledgling scarlet and great green macaws. But introducing young birds into a complex forest world – bereft of the cultural education normally provided by parents – is slow and risky.For 30 years or so scientists have referred to the ersity of life on Earth as “biological ersity”, or just “bioersity”. They usually define bioersity as operating at three levels: the ersity of genes within any particular species the ersity of species in a given place and the ersity of habitat types such as forests, coral reefs, and so on. But does that cover it? Not really. A fourth level has been almost entirely overlooked: cultural ersity.Culture is knowledge and skills that flow socially from inidual to inidual and generation to generation. It’s not in genes. Socially learned skills, traditions and dialects that answer the question of “how we live here” are crucial to helping many populations survive – or recover. Crucially, culturally learned skills vary from place to place. In the human family many cultures, underappreciated, have been lost. Culture in the other-than-human world has been almost entirely missed.We are just recognising that in many species, survival skills must be learned from elders who learned from their elders. Until now, culture has remained a largely hidden, unrecognised layer of wild lives. Yet for many species culture is both crucial and fragile. Long before a population declines to numbers low enough to seem threatened with extinction, their special cultural knowledge, earned and passed down over long generations, begins disappearing. Recovery of lost populations then becomes much more difficult than bringing in a few iniduals and turning them loose.Many young birds learn much by observing their parents, and parrots probably need to learn more than most. Survival of released iniduals is severely undermined if there are no free-living elder role models. Trying to restore parrot populations by captive breeding is not as easy as training young or orphaned creatures to recognise what is food while they’re in the safety of a cage – then simply opening the door. “In a cage,” Williams says, “you can’t train them to know where, when and how to find that food, or about trees with good nest sites.” Parents would normally have done exactly that.A generational break in cultural traditions hampered attempts to reintroduce thick-billed parrots to parts of south-west America, where they’d been wiped out. Conservation workers could not teach the captive-raised parrots to search for and find their traditional wild foods, skills they would have learned from parents.Landscapes, always complex, are under accelerated change. Culture enables adaptation far faster than genes alone can navigate hairpin turns in time. In some places, pigeons and sparrows have learned to use motion-sensors to get inside enclosed shopping malls and forage for crumbs. Crows have in some locales learned to drop nuts on the road for cars to crack. In at least one area they do this at intersections, so they can safely walk out and collect their cracked prizes when the light turns red and the cars stop. They’ve developed answers to the new question: “How can we survive here, in this never-before world?”Because the answers are local, and learned from elders, wild cultures can be lost faster than genetic ersity. When populations plummet, traditions that helped animals survive and adapt to a place begin to vanish.In a scientific article on the vocabulary of larks living in north Africa and Spain titled, “Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes”, researchers reported that as human development shrinks habitats into patches, “isolation is associated with impoverishment”. They write: “Song repertoires pass through a cultural bottleneck and significantly decline in variety.”Unfortunately, isolated larks are not an isolated case. Researchers studying South America’s orange-billed sparrow found that sparrow “song complexity” – the number of syllables per song and song length – deteriorated as humans continued whittling their forests into fragments. When a scientist replayed 24-year-old recordings of singing male white-crowned sparrows at the same location she’d recorded them, they elicited half the responses they had when first recorded. The birds’ responses show that changes in the dialect lead to changes in listener preference, a bit analogous to pop music. And as with humans, preferences can affect whether a particular bird will be accepted as a mate. White-crowned sparrows singing a local dialect become fathers of more offspring than do singers of unfamiliar dialects, indicating females prefer a familiar tune.I’m not just talking about a few songs. Survival of numerous species depends on cultural adaptation. How many? We’re just beginning to ask such questions. But the preliminary answers indicate surprising and widespread ways that animals survive by cultural learning. Regionally different vocalisations are sometimes called “song traditions” but the more commonly used word is “dialects”. More than a hundred studies have been published on dialects in birds. And it’s not just birds but a wide array of animals Including some fish.“Cod particularly,” said Steve Simpson of the University of Exeter, “have very elaborate calls compared with many fish.” You can easily hear differences in recorded calls of American and European Atlantic cod. “This species is highly vocal with traditional breeding grounds established over hundreds or even thousands of years.” Many fish follow elders to feeding, resting and breeding areas. In experiments, introduced outsiders who learned such preferred locales by following elders continued to use these traditional routes after all the original fish from whom they learned were gone.Cultural survival skills erode as habitats shrink. Maintaining genetic ersity is not enough. We’ve become accustomed to a perilous satisfaction with precariously minimal populations that not only risk genetic viability of populations but almost guarantee losing local cultural knowledge by which populations have lived and survived.In all free-living parrots that have been studied, nestlings develop inidually unique calls, learned from their parents. Researchers have described this as “an intriguing parallel with human parents naming infants”. Indeed, these vocal identities help iniduals distinguish neighbours, mates, sexes and iniduals the same functions that human names serve.Williams tells me that when he studied Amazon parrots, he could hear differences between them saying, essentially, “Let’s go”, “I’m here, where are you?” and “Darling, I just brought breakfast”. Researchers who develop really good ears for parrot vocalisation and use technology to study recordings show that parrot noise is more organised and meaningful than it sounds to beginners like me. In a study of budgerigars, for instance, birds who were unfamiliar with each other were placed together. Groups of unfamiliar females took a few weeks for their calls to converge and sound similar. Males copied the calls of females. Black-capped chickadees flock members’ calls converge, so they can distinguish members of their own flock from those of other flocks. The fact that this happens, and that it takes weeks, suggests that free-living groups must normally be stable, that groups have their own identity, and that the members identify with their group.Group identity, we see repeatedly, is not exclusively human. Sperm whales learn and announce their group identity. Young fruit bats learn the dialects of the crowds they’re in. Ravens know who’s in, who’s out. Too many animals to list know what group, troop, family or pack they belong with. In Brazil, some dolphins drive fish toward fishermen’s nets for a share of the catch. Other dolphins don’t. The ones who do, sound different from the ones who don’t. Various dolphin groups who specialise in a food-getting technique won’t socialise with other groups who use different techniques. And orca whales, the most socially complex non-humans, have layered societies of pods, clans and communities, with community members all knowing the members of all their constituent pods, but each community scrupulously avoiding contact with members of another community. All this social organisation is learned from elders.Elders appear important for social learning of migratory routes. Various storks, vultures, eagles and hawks all depend on following the cues of elders to locate strategic migration flyways or important stopover sites. These could be called their migration cultures. Famously, conservationists have raised young cranes, geese and swans to follow microlight aircraft as a surrogate parent on first migrations. Without such enculturation, they would not have known where to go. The young birds absorbed knowledge of routes, then used them in later seasons on their own self-guided migrations. Four thousand species of birds migrate, so Andrew Whiten of the University of St Andrews in Scotland speculates that following experienced birds may be an underappreciated but “very significant realm of cultural transmission”.When you look at free-living animals, you don’t usually see culture. Culture makes itself visible when it gets disrupted. Then we see that the road back to reestablishing cultures – the answers to the questions of “how we live in this place” – is difficult, often fatal.Young mammals too – moose, bison, deer, antelope, wild sheep, ibex and many others – learn crucial migration routes and destinations from elder keepers of traditional knowledge. Conservationists have recently reintroduced large mammals in a few areas where they’ve been wiped out, but because animals released into unfamiliar landscapes don’t know where food is, where dangers lurk, or where to go in changing seasons, many translocations have failed.Williams describes his procedure with the macaws as “very much a slow release”. First his team trains the birds to use a feeder. With that safety net, they can explore the forest, gain local knowledge, begin dispersing and using wild foods.Some rescue programmes declare success if a released animal survives one year. “A year is meaningless for a bird like a macaw that doesn’t mature until it’s eight years old,” says Williams.I ask what they’re doing for those eight long years.“Social learning,” Williams replies immediately. “Working out who’s who, how to interact, like kids in school.”To gain access to the future, to mate and to raise young, the birds Williams is releasing must enter into the culture of their kind. But from whom will they learn, if no one is out there? At the very least they must be socially oriented to one another. Ex-pets are the worst candidates for release they don’t interact appropriately with other macaws, and they want to hang around near humans. To assess the social abilities of 13 scarlet macaws who were scheduled for release, Williams and his crew documented how much time they spent close to another bird, how often they initiated aggression, things like that. When the bird scoring lowest for social skills was released, he flew out the door and was never seen again. The next-to-lowest didn’t adapt to the free-living life and had to be retrieved. The third-lowest social scorer remained at liberty but stayed alone a lot. The rest did well.All of the above adds up to this: a species isn’t just one big jar of jellybeans of the same colour. It’s different smaller jars with differing hues in different places. From region to region, genetics can vary. And cultural traditions can differ. Different populations might use different tools, different migration routes, different ways of calling, courting and being understood. All populations have their answers to the question of how to live where they live.“Sometimes a group will be foraging in a tree,” Williams says. “A pair will fly overhead on a straight path. Someone will make a contact call, and the flying birds will loop around and land with the callers. They seem to have their friends.” Bottom line, said Williams, there is much going on in the social and cultural lives of his macaws and other species, much that they understand – but we don’t. We have a lot of questions. The answers must lurk, somewhere, in their minds.As land, weather and climate change, some aspects of cultural knowledge will be the tickets necessary for boarding the future. Others will die out. Across the range of chimpanzees, cultures vary greatly, as do habitats. All populations but one use stick tools. Some use simple probes, others fashion multi-stick toolsets. Only one population makes pointed daggers for hunting small nocturnal primates called bush-babies hiding in tree holes. Only the westernmost chimpanzees crack nuts with stones.As researchers have noted, distinctive tool-using traditions at particular sites are defining features of unique chimpanzee cultures. Whiten wrote: “Chimpanzee communities resemble human cultures in possessing suites of local traditions that uniquely identify them … A complex social inheritance system that complements the genetic picture.”Some chimpanzee populations have learned to track the progress of dozens of specific trees ripening in their dense forests. Others live in open semi-savannah. Some are more aggressively male-dominated, some populations more egalitarian. Some almost never see people some live in sight of human settlements and have learned to crop-raid at night. For a long, long time chimpanzees have been works in progress. “We’ve learned,” writes Craig Stanford, “not to speak of ‘The Chimpanzee’.” Chimpanzees vary and chimpanzee culture is variable at every level.“It’s not just the loss of populations of chimps that worries me,” Cat Hobaiter emphasised when I spent several weeks with her studying chimpanzees in Uganda. “I find terrifying the possibility of losing each population’s unique culture. That’s permanent.”Diversity in cultural pools – perhaps more crucially than in gene pools – will make species survival more likely. If pressures cause regional populations to blink out, a species’ odds of persisting dim.Williams’ goal is to re-establish macaws where they range no longer, in hopes that they, and their forests, will recover. (Most of the central American forests that macaws need have been felled and burned, largely so fast-food burger chains can sell cheap beef.) It often takes a couple of generations for human immigrant families to learn how to function effectively in their new culture it may take two or three generations before an introduced population of macaws succeeds. In other words, macaws are born to be wild. But becoming wild requires an education.So what’s at stake is not just numbers. What’s at stake is: ways of knowing how to be in the world. Culture isn’t just a boutique concern. Cultural knowledge is what allows many populations to survive. Keeping the knowledge of how to live in a habitat can be almost as important to the persistence of a species as keeping the habitat both are needed. Cultural ersity itself is a source of resilience and adaptability to change. And change is accelerating.This is an edited extract from Becoming Wild: How Animals Learn to be Animals by Carl Safina, which published in the UK by Oneworld on 9 April and in the US by Henry Holt and Co on 14 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c8ff10f9d7b0ff0e4ecf76609426b990d5e767c/0_3_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03fa8310984a2bb61e5afa34655196c5","title":"britney spears film critic dr dolittle","story":"The singer and sometime actor has embarked on a new lockdown career as a movie pundit. And, so far, she’s reading the public mood perfectlyThe coronavirus crisis hasn’t been kind to performers. On a practical scale, schedules have been wiped and income reduced to zero. But psychologically, it also means that the planet’s biggest extroverts have been robbed of an outlet. They have all this pent-up desire for approval, and nowhere to put it.Until now, this has largely manifested itself in slightly cringey iPhone videos uploaded to the internet. But now Britney Spears, that bold pioneer, has opened up a whole new avenue of quarantined expression. That’s right, she has become a film reviewer.The first fruits of Britney’s side-hustle appeared last night, as she posted her review of the Robert Downey Jr film Dolittle on Instagram. It reads:This movie is a must see !!! @RobertDowneyJr is so genuine you fall in love with him … the animal characters are hilarious and there seems to be a Special Tone throughout the whole movie which I find hard to find these days 🤔🤔🤔😘. So if you watch this movie and you’re as enamored as I was with his jackets and clothing … don’t get lost like I did 😂 just remember he’s a man who can speak to animals and he’s brilliant 🦜🐳🦁🐷🐻🦋💕 !!!!! Pss … how long has it been since you’ve seen what you’ve wanted to see … I can’t even count how many movies I’ve watched in this quarantine so far 🙄🙄🙄😅😅😅 !!!!!”Now, it’s easy to mock Spears for this. The capitalisation of “Special Tone”. The term “I find hard to find”. The implication that the plot was slightly too complex for her. The fact that she is posting a critical rave for a film that not only contains a climactic scene where Robert Downey Jr frantically pulls a bagpipe from a dragon’s bum, but is currently on schedule to be the biggest commercial flop of the year.After all, Britney’s assessment of the film is quite the outlier. Compare her Dolittle rave with the ’s Peter Bradshaw review, which called the film “horribly inert”. Or Empire, which deemed it “lacklustre”. Or Total Film, which described it as “lifeless and dead-eyed”. Or NPR, who decided it was less a film and more “a crime scene in need of forensic analysis”. Perhaps Britney was expecting less of Dolittle. Perhaps she uses a different set of criteria to evaluate cinema. Perhaps she watched the wrong film by accident. We may never know.And, don’t forget, Dolittle is a flop. Far fewer people went to see it than anticipated, so there’s a real chance that Spears’ praise will inspire hundreds of thousands to seek it out. It might even dig the film out of the mire a little. For a successful actor such as Spears (no, really her 2002 film Crossroads made its budget back five times over, making it a much hotter commercial property than Dolittle) to reach down and help an underdog like this shows a lot of class.Now we just have to sit back and wait to see what she reviews next. Will she continue to buck the critical trend, by slagging off Uncut Gems or embracing Playmobil: The Movie? Will she maintain her dedication to focusing on underperforming releases, by reviewing UglyDolls or The Goldfinch? How on earth will she use emojis to convey the Special Tone of Colour Out of Space or The Hunt? Either way, she has to review more films. Her public demands it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d1d8324ea3d9adb3ea91dd5a71c1760a948d6f/0_99_2861_1716/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0757300a759b3defbc4fee10e2e11b9","title":"superhero movies coronavirus marvel cinematic universe dc comics","story":"From Wonder Woman to Superman, Black Widow to Black Panther, superheroes can vanquish aliens, androids and Nazis. They’re less super in a pandemicAfter the massive 2019 hits Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far from Home, it seemed a safe bet that the Marvel Cinematic Universe would go on for ever. The high-flying blockbusters with their tight costumes, digital effects and insouciant quips could pack cinemas until the apocalypse. There would never again be a year without superheroes.Sadly, the apocalypse has come sooner than expected. Superheroes can fight secret quasi-Nazi conspiracies, invading aliens and android armies. But they are ill-equipped to fight the coronavirus. Superheroes on screen have saved the world repeatedly. But, in this real-life crisis, the MCU’s vision of empowerment via teaming up to blast things to smithereens seems woefully inadequate.The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the film industry. Like most major releases, MCU films scheduled for spring and summer have been delayed until autumn, or pushed into next year. Black Widow has been moved from 1 May to 6 November, and the new date will mean the longest pause between MCU releases since The Incredible Hulk (2008) was followed two years later by Iron Man 2.The date changes reflect the logistical challenges of showing movies at the moment. Beyond that, though, the superhero genre feels irrelevant in a pandemic. Superheroes have always been given oomph and whoosh, not by disease but by war. The first huge success in the superhero genre came soon after the start of the second world war. In one of his early adventures, Superman, the first superhero, captured Hitler and Stalin to end the war. Other patriotic heroes such as the red-white-and-blue-clad Captain America and Wonder Woman regularly thumped Nazis and Japanese infiltrators on the home front.Superhero comics in the war years could sell hundreds of thousands of copies an issue – a level of popularity the genre didn’t see again until the post-911 “war on terror”. Iron Man (2008) showed Tony Stark blasting away evil terrorists in the for ever war in Afghanistan, while Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019 imagined our hero gaining control of an army of drones more powerful even than America’s own deadly stockpile. Over the 11 years between those two films, the MCU franchise grossed $22.5bn.The appeal of superheroes in wartime is straightforward. They’re an empowerment fantasy of strength, violence and victory. MCU plots can be more or less clever, but the films rely on images of muscular men and women punching or blasting large numbers of bad guys until the bad guys fall over, or else stand up to be punched and blasted some more. The MCU narratives, with their incessant crossovers and team-ups, are about powerful people banding together to thump the snot out of their enemies. They’re popular at moments of militarism because their approach to problems is militaristic. There are enemies out there, and you beat them with a combination of unity and overwhelming force.But overwhelming force is little use against a virus, and teaming up physically is harmful. Invulnerable superheroes swoop across vast distances to confront their foes in endless, glorious battle. In contrast, our virus response involves immobilisation, isolation and enforced inactivity as the economy collapses and we wait anxiously to start coughing. Instead of empowering fisticuffs, we’re called to help others and ourselves through deliberate self-disempowerment.If there is heroism, it’s the heroism of enduring as everyone becomes less super. Disaster movies such as Contagion or zombie films are too eventful to capture our apocalypse of immobility. But they get a lot closer than superhero narratives. It’s hard to imagine yourself saving the world when you can barely imagine leaving the house to visit your loved ones.So will the virus finally take the wind out of the cape of the superhero genre? The answer is probably not. It’s true that, even before the virus hit, there were signs that the superhero craze might be slowing down – DC’s Birds of Prey, released earlier this year, for example, was a financial disappointment. But US wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East grind on, tentative peace proposals notwithstanding. And fans certainly remain excited about forthcoming MCU sequels.Coronavirus won’t end the MCU permanently. But the enforced pause is a reminder that superheroes as a genre frame problems and solutions in specific ways, responding to specific historical conditions.

It’s easier than you’d imagine – and this delicious recipe includes vegan and gluten-free optionsTiny cream ducklings nestled in cheesecake inside chocolate eggs – surely that’s worth having a quack at? These look a little challenging to make, but when you break down the steps, they are not too difficult. The hardest part is tempering the chocolate, but you can use compound chocolate to make things quicker and easier. And if you haven’t got the moulds mentioned below, you can always fill a shop-bought Easter egg. There’s nothing wrong with shortcuts, especially now. There are a few other options here to help you get round any shortages of ingredients.For the chocolate egg30g dark chocolate500g white chocolate, roughly chopped (or compound chocolate, eg, candy melts)Cocoa-butter-based or oil-based food dye of your choice (not water-based)For the biscuit base85g digestive biscuits (or any similar sweet, plain biscuit)35g melted butter (or 30g melted coconut oil)Alternative biscuit base (vegan and gluten-free)50g dates50g blanched almonds (you can substitute other nuts and adjust quantities to adjust sweetness)Pinch of salt5g melted coconut oil or melted coconut butter (optional)For the cheesecake200g cream cheese100g double cream (or condensed milk)100g mascarpone (or cream cheese)65g caster sugarGrated rind of 1 lemonAlternative cheesecake (vegan and gluten-free)180g cashewsJuice of 1 lemonZest of 1 lemon60g melted coconut oil or melted coconut butter150g coconut milk120g agave syrup (or golden syrup, or similar)For the cream ducklingsIf you’re short on ingredients or don’t trust your piping skills, make these using coloured fondant, or use any cute Easter ornaments. Just make sure you tell people to remove them before eating200g double cream20g icing sugarBlack, orange and yellow food dyeMelt the dark chocolate in a microwave, and use a stiff paintbrush to splatter specks into 16 silicone semi-sphere moulds (approx 7cm3in diameter). Next, melt 375g of the white chocolate in a bain marie. Take it to 43C, then remove from the heat and add the remaining chocolate chunks and chosen food colour. Stir until it comes down to 28-29C, then use a spoon to coat the silicone moulds with the chocolate. Place the moulds in the freezer for 10 minutes, then the chocolate should easily pop out of them. If you want to avoid tempering, use candy meltscompound chocolate instead. It doesn’t taste as amazing as real chocolate, but is worth using if you are short on time or are baking with kids.Use a warm plate to melt the base of two semi-spheres, then stick together. Repeat with all. Then use a spoon to crack away the top of each “egg”.To make the biscuit base, place the biscuits in a freezer bag and then bash into crumbs using a rolling pin. Stir the crumbs together with the melted butter. For the vegan and gluten-free version, place the dates in a food processor and process until sticky and forming a ball. Then add the almonds, salt and coconut oil, and process again until combined. Whichever base you have opted for, spoon it into the bottom of each chocolate egg. Use the back of the spoon to press it down gently.Next, make the cheesecake: put all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk together until smooth. For the vegan alternative, first soak the cashews by pouring boiling water over them and leaving for half an hour, then drain all the water. Place the cashews, lemon juice and lemon zest in a food processor and blend until smooth. Add the coconut oil, coconut milk and agave syrup, and process again until very smooth.Spoon the cheesecake over the biscuit base.For the ducklings, whip the cream with the icing sugar until it reaches soft peaks (ideally, underwhip as you will whip it further when adding dyes). Transfer a tablespoon to a separate bowl and colour with black gel food dye. Transfer to a piping bag and cut a small tip. Do the same again, but colour the cream orange this time. Lastly, add yellow food dye to the remaining cream, and combine. Transfer to a piping bag and cut a large opening. Use the yellow cream to pipe the main duckling shape, and then use the coloured creams for the details. To add the small tufts on top of the ducklings’ heads, place the large bag of yellow cream in another piping bag, cut a small tip, and use to pipe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ccee9a53be6a101143a43b964f645bbbe974a0/0_0_1451_871/master/1451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c68d25e46777c871c803c519b8a471c","title":"a trick a day how football freestyler liv cooke is bringing light to the lockdown","story":"Four-times world record holder is posting tricks that others can follow indoors – hopefully without breaking anythingLiv Cooke recognises the peculiarity of her position during lockdown. Football as mass entertainment has ceased and yet, for one of the world’s leading professional freestylers, it is debatable whether the popularity and profile of her chosen sport has ever felt so high. The platform has enabled Cooke to provide education as well as offer escapism.“Freestyle football is a massively growing sport and right now it feels like every professional footballer is becoming a freestyler too,” says Cooke, the 2017 world champion, the UK’s first woman professional freestyler, and now a BBC presenter. “We’ve seen Paul Pogba doing around the worlds at home and many others too. It’s putting the sport in a positive light. It helped me physically and mentally and now I’m addicted to it. It changed my life and if it can help others at this time then that is a beautiful thing.”“I posted a video of me doing a trick in my kitchen and people were asking me how to do it,” Cooke explains. “So I thought this would be the perfect time to do it. People can go on a downward spiral when they’re stuck at home but this keeps you happy and fit.“The idea is to build up from beginners’ tricks to more difficult tricks. The hardest part has been thinking of a trick and then making sure it can be done indoors, otherwise people might end up breaking everything.“At first we scripted the tricks but that wasn’t working, it just wasn’t me, but when we started doing them off-the-cuff it allowed me to think in the moment and that was much better. We’re doing one trick a day during isolation and if we have to keep going then I’ll just have to be creative I am a professional freestyler after all.”Cooke had established a huge social media following before the lockdown – 4.1m followers and counting on TikTok, for example – with a role on MOTDx following on from her professional successes and commercial appearances. The reaction, therefore, has been less surprising than the public’s ability to copy the tricks.“What has surprised me is how many people have accomplished the tricks and how quickly they’ve picked it up,” Cooke says. “It just shows how important social media is. I was aware of its importance before the isolation. I had young girls coming up to me to say I had inspired them.“I’m a girl from a small town in Lancashire and if I can do it, so can they. But during this isolation I’ve noticed the power of social media to do something good.“If I have the power to make a difference then now is the time to show it. I think the benefits vary. Some people may have nothing to do and having a trick to try gives them a focus for an hour or two and stops them going into a downward spiral.“Others who are working from home may be sat in a chair all day so it gives them a break, a bit of exercise and refreshes them. It’s important to learn new skills constantly.”Cooke’s productivity during the lockdown does not end with teaching the reverse crossover, the side-of-the-head stall and ‘the Slap’ to a mass audience. She has also signed up for the Royal Voluntary Service since the crisis began although professional work – such as her role as a global ambassador for Euro 2020 – has naturally been affected, along with preparations to play in this summer’s Soccer Aid fundraiser at Old Trafford.“I was really looking forward to Soccer Aid, which was going to be my first proper match in six years,” says Cooke, who played for Preston’s junior sides and Blackburn’s centre of excellence before a recurring back injury erted her career towards freestyle. “It’s a real shame that has been postponed as it raises so much money for Unicef but nothing is more important than peoples’ health so I’m glad it has been postponed. I’m not seeing that as a negative.“NHS staff are working crazy hours. My sister-in-law Emma is working non-stop in the NHS. She’s putting her life on the line so it’s only right that we postpone these events and don’t place any more strain on the NHS. The only problem for me is that my family is in Leyland and I’m in Manchester. I really miss them but my situation doesn’t compare at all – I can still work from home and do my videos.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c3d089dd7ce43445ddc3fc0f6c9fe6bf90d72f/0_0_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9984bbe629f7de9bea4babe76b4be05d","title":"premier league players new contracts transfer window","story":"Jeff Hendrick, Jan Vertonghen, Willian and Ryan Fraser are all out of contract soon. Should their clubs offer them new deals?By Martin Laurence for WhoScoredFifa announced this week that players whose contracts were due to expire in June can be offered short-term extensions to let them complete the current season with their clubs. The clarification means that players who thought they had played their last game for their clubs may now stay on until the 2019-20 season finishes.Clubs are likely to take up the option in most cases given their inability to sign replacements – the rescheduling of the transfer window is another matter to be decided – but should they be offering longer-term deals to these players? Here are 10 players whose futures remain up in the air and our suggestions for what their clubs should do.Bournemouth could be short of two wingers before long. They will surely extend Ryan Fraser’s deal, if only for the short term. He has failed to live up to the standards he set last season – when he scored seven goals and up another 14 – but Eddie Howe will not want to let him go. Fraser’s stock has dipped but he would attract suitors. He is still a livewire who has proven he can do it in the top flight. And he is only 26.Ibe, who is just 24, should have even more time to develop but the rate at which he has done so – if at all – since his club record £15m move from Liverpool to the south coast will not have Bournemouth clambering to agree terms, let alone other top flight clubs. He has not started a single league game this season. Ibe has promise. He played for England’s under 18s, 19s, 20s and 21s, and is a strong dribbler, but perhaps he needs to drop down a league to rebuild his reputation.Another team with two first team players of the same position with contracts expiring, Burnley will surely keep one of the two on their books at least, with Ashley Westwood likely to be the priority.Westwood is an understated player but he is very much appreciated at Burnley, having won both the players’ and supporters’ player of the year awards last season. The 30-year-old midfielder has been a near ever present yet again this season, with his ability at set pieces a big asset to a side that are often dominant in the air, giving him five assists so far this season.Sean Dyche has a bigger decision to make over Jeff Hendrick. The Republic of Ireland international has played much of each of his four seasons at Turf Moor without ever really being a guaranteed starter. Still the must likely of Burnley’s workman-like midfield to chip in with a goal, he’s never managed more than three in a Premier League campaign having offered a relatively frequent threat in the second tier at Derby.Chelsea are perhaps the club with the biggest decisions to make regarding expiring contracts. Chelsea have three high-profile thirty-somethings who have been free to negotiate with other clubs since the turn of the year.The Blues would be wise to keep Willian on the books given his continued, albeit waning, influence in the final third he has scored five goals and set up five more in the league this season. They may not offer a contract that is long enough to persuade him to stay. Longstanding interest from Barcelona appears to have cooled, but there will be plenty of clubs offering European football to the 31-year-old.The same could be said of Olivier Giroud, though the Frenchman, now 33, must decide what role he is happy to take up in the twilight of his career. Frozen out for much of this season, having returned to the first team due to injury to Tammy Abraham earlier in the year, Giroud proved his lasting value. He has never been blessed with pace, but instead has an ability to link up with others from the front unlike many around. The former Arsenal man has not really had to adjust his game and would continue to be a real asset to Chelsea as a back-up striker if they convince him to stay.As far as Pedro is concerned, the Spaniard’s five-season spell in the capital is likely to come to an end. He has started just eight league games this season as Frank Lampard has looked to give youth a chance and has had a direct hand in just two goals in that time.Mendy was a club record signing when he arrived at Leicester in 2016, but he has not lived up to his £13m price tag. The 27-year-old became quite prominent towards the end of Claude Puel’s reign, starting 23 of 31 league appearances last season, but he has been overlooked since Brendan Rodgers took over.In contrast to Mendy, Lundstram is sure to be offered a deal beyond his current contract. The 26-year-old has become something of a cult figure in terms of fantasy football this season for people looking for a bargain, having had a hand in seven goals this season.He has started more matches for the Blades this season than in the club’s two previous season in the Championship. He has adapted to top-flight football perhaps even better than Chris Wilder would have expected.Having reportedly fallen out with both Mauricio Pochettino and José Mourinho at different stages of this season, Vertonghen is likely to move on. A return to Ajax has been mooted for the Belgian who, at 32, is unlikely to receive even a medium-term deal at Tottenham.He has started just 18 of the club’s 29 league matches this season, earning his lowest rating (6.85) since arriving in England back in 2012. His career in England has been a success – and Spurs fans should hold the defender in high regard – but the time seems right for “Super Jan” to fly away.• Visit WhoScored for more statistics and analysis• Follow WhoScored and Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac3262eb862a597b9679b63c06a0cfd6b101d633/0_117_5012_3010/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29ba3fd655436cb203426c442e22cec2","title":"from vitamin c to breathing exercises doctors on what you should really do for your health right now","story":"There is a lot of confusion about how to protect yourself from illness – and what to do if do you contract coronavirus. Here is the expert adviceYou will already be regularly washing your hands and social distancing, but many of us are still likely to become infected with coronavirus. Doing what you can now to improve your health and boost your immune system will help your body cope. Thankfully, the majority of cases are mild and you should recover within a week, though if your symptoms are persistent it is vital to seek medical advice from NHS 111 rather than try to continue to manage at home. With that in mind, here’s what you can do to put yourself in the best position to help your recovery.There is no magic supplement. The advice is as it’s always been: reduce your alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep well and reduce stress. A varied, balanced diet, with lots of vegetables and fruit, is important, but there is little evidence for most vitamin and mineral supplements. Getting out in the sun each day can also be beneficial, says the GP Amir Khan. “The majority of people have low vitamin D because we don’t have enough sunlight in the UK, and we are coming out of winter. Vitamin D levels will be depleted, so there’s no harm in taking a vitamin D tablet.”Many people who are suspected of having had the virus report at least one day of fatigue. Now is not the time to try to tough things out. “Your body is using all its energy to fight a virus that is infecting cell after cell,” says Khan. “Even with mild symptoms, you’ll have some days when you feel fine and other days when you are tired and achey. You can potter around the house and make food if you need to, but you shouldn’t be doing any more than that and, where possible, you should be on the sofa or in bed.”Khan says: “Everybody should be sticking to two to three litres of fluid a day” – as normal. When you have a fever, says Saira Ghafur, an honorary respiratory consultant at St Mary’s hospital in London, “you can become dehydrated, so you need to make sure that even if you don’t feel like it, you’re drinking as much as possible. If you feel you’re not peeing very much, that’s another sign you’re very dehydrated and should seek medical advice.”Take paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen. There has been concern that ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory, could reduce immune function and make coronavirus symptoms worse, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. Still, the advice is to take paracetamol for fever and muscle pain instead. “If you have been prescribed ibuprofen and develop symptoms of Covid-19 then discuss that with your medical practitioner,” says Wingfield.Khan has seen advice online about taking vitamin C to treat coronavirus – but that doesn’t mean you should be trying this at home. “It has been used intravenously in very, very high doses in hospitals in China. That’s a big difference to what you get in a tablet. The jury is still very much out in terms of using intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus.”Taking a vitamin C tablet from the chemist or supermarket “won’t stop you getting an infection and it won’t help treat the infection”, says Khan. And certainly don’t try to take very high doses.Don’t pin your hopes on “superfoods” or the social media posts about “alkaline” foods (a virus doesn’t have a pH level, and you can’t change the body’s pH level through diet). What about garlic? “It may help reduce the length of things like a cold, but won’t prevent it,” says Khan. And there’s no evidence it has any effect on coronavirus.It’s far from clear. On Monday, the author JK Rowling shared a video of Sarfaraz Munshi, the head of urgent care at Queen’s hospital in Romford, London, demonstrating breathing techniques that he said could relieve symptoms and prevent someone developing a secondary pneumonia infection. People with asthma and those recovering from pneumonia are often helped by respiratory physiotherapists, says Wingfield, “who can help support your breathing with exercises. The main thing you are trying to do is make patients’ lungs open as much as they can and try and get rid of some of the fluid and inflammatory material.”“What you’re really doing there is forcing air into the alveoli by taking big breaths in and holding the alveoli open, and that will help clear any excess mucus, pathogens, as well as stop them from becoming hardened, which can happen. This is with the caveat that you are safe to stay at home and you don’t need to be in hospital. If there’s any chance of pneumonia, you should be in hospital.”However, Laura Breach, a spokeswoman for the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care (ACPRC), says while the exercises should be harmless for healthy iniduals, she would not advise them, adding that they could make symptoms worse in someone suffering breathlessness. Although Munshi’s video was well-intentioned, the ACPRC says the techniques are not correct (it is preparing its own video). If you did try the exercise, you only need to take three or four breaths so as not to hyperventilate and become dizzy, and if you have coronavirus symptoms, there is no need to make yourself cough as part of the exercise. “We would always encourage nose-breathing rather than mouth-breathing, because your nose is really important in humidifying the air that you breathe in and catching any particles in the air,” says Breach.There is no evidence these exercises will help healthy people prepare for the illness, she says. “There are patients with longer-term respiratory conditions and we do teach them techniques to give them a better starting point. If it’s something you should be doing then your healthcare professional will have already advised that.” Instead, the ACPRC says: “Propping yourself up with pillows, or leaning forward onto the back of a chair” can be beneficial to breathlessness.Wingfield also questions whether the exercises can aid recovery from coronavirus – “it’s a slightly evidence-free zone” – and says if you are having trouble breathing, you should seek medical help rather than simply try to follow breathing exercises at home. “But they can keep your lungs moving, and some people might find these exercises meditative and stress-relieving,” says Wingfield. Ghafur agrees: “None of this is evidence-based.”One of the big things in intensive care that we’re seeing with a lot of patients,’ says Ghafur, “is you have to put them on a ventilator in what we call a prone position, which basically means you’re lying on your front. It’s not in any recommended guidance for patients who are not in intensive care, but if you’re able to lie on your front for a while that can help breathing.” There’s no harm in trying it, she says, but only if you’re generally fit and healthy. Do not try to lie on your front if you are older, infirm, have mobility problems or are pregnant.Lying continuously on your back is not ideal. “If you can sit and take deep breaths in and out, that will help any respiratory condition – you’re taking in a bigger lungful of air and that will help remove any mucus.” However, she adds that there is no evidence that this will improve your recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/689dd88723bd801e8cc9aaf72efb3d7fb742637d/280_491_4558_2734/master/4558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a833b790baa5cb7a488d1603797aa0b","title":"have you and your uk neighbours become friendlier since the coronavirus lockdown","story":"We would like to hear about your neighbourly tales during the coronavirus lockdownHave you become more neighbourly?Do you have a new back (or front) garden community – all kept at a respectable social distance, of course?

Last week it warned regulated radio and television stations to take extra care not to broadcast potentially damaging claims about the pandemic, with a promise to expedite investigations linked to coronavirus.London Live is controlled by Evgeny Lebedev and operates from the same offices as his newspaper titles Evening Standard and Independent.London Live defended the decision to broadcast the interview with Icke, which was edited down from an even longer online interview conducted last month by the unrelated YouTube channel London Real.They said those complaining were confusing the material they broadcast with a separate interview Icke conducted with London Real this week, which was banned from YouTube for spreading potentially damaging claims about 5G mobile networks.A spokesperson for London Live said: “We note that several commentators on social media have complained about our decision, however, we also note those complaints are about another interview with David Icke. We did not broadcast the interview which is the subject of the complaints on social media.“Commentators are confusing the interview broadcast last night with an interview with David Icke which was removed from YouTube. The interview London Live did broadcast is still available on YouTube. We regret if we have given any rise to this confusion.”In a minute-long clip of the broadcast uploaded to London Live’s Twitter account, Icke insinuates a connection between coronavirus research and the Israeli state, while also claiming any moves to require people to ultimately be vaccinated for coronavirus is “fascism”.The broadcast was prefaced with a warning from the channel that the “views contained in this programme are those of iniduals articulating them and are not necessarily those of London Live”.London Live is one of the local television stations introduced by the former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt almost a decade ago but has struggled to reach large audiences. Despite this it enjoys a prominent position on programme listings, which can help attract casual viewers.The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the material consisted of “lunatic conspiracy theories and no sensible person would give them a moment’s thought … Clearly that station is regulated by Ofcom and I would be expecting Ofcom to take appropriate action.”Icke is a former Hereford United goalkeeper who has long been of the most prominent figures in global conspiracist circles. One concern of factcheckers is that debunking baseless theories can ultimately elevate them, with Icke’s supporters holding up YouTube’s deletion of videos as a sign that he is right.While Ofcom can issue sanctions to regulated broadcast radio and television stations, there is currently no substantive regulation of social media output. Online broadcasts can reach a vast audience but oversight of content relies on the whims of private companies.The juxtaposition between regulation of online and broadcast media is stark. According to figures provided by overnights.tv, a peak audience of about 80,000 people watched Wednesday night’s edited David Icke interview on London Live, which has attracted comment from cabinet ministers and potential regulatory intervention.By comparison, 5.2m viewers watched the original unedited interview on YouTube without any government intervention or media questions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ecf59551b612732c03b2aa730c69a4b3a44d06/0_1588_4912_2944/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f72dc36ed4f766e699c4dcc183b3fe14","title":"laurel halos lockdown listening theres this element of human touch","story":"The electronic musician picks intimate and comforting music to get you through the coronavirus pandemicI was joking recently that electronic musicians have been self-isolating for years, so we are practiced at this. All my gigs were cancelled, and so time takes on a different quality. There’s something about all of this music I’m listening to that speaks to us slowing down – that speaks to this vacuum of urgency. It’s peaceful, serene, disembodied music to kind of get lost in.The Italian ambient composer Gigi Masin is music for any time. I love sweet music that isn’t saccharine. Most music is just corny, and this edges towards that – there’s this really amazing moment before something slips into being bad taste. To me there’s something a bit reserved and wistful about his music. It doesn’t do full throttle with emotion and it’s more powerful as a result. All the things that are left unsaid ... it has a wistful quality is really powerful. That’s completely subjective, though, someone might listen to Masin and think it’s corny as fuck.Playing Piano for Dad by H Hunt has this really beautiful cut-up feel, as if somebody was just sitting at the piano and trying to remember some jazz standards they learned as a teenager. They keep tripping, trying to figure it out over and over again. That process element is really nice – I love making recordings with audible damper pedal sounds, key sounds, the sounds of adjusting your chair. It’s very tactile, sensual music.Morton Feldman’s Triadic Memories, and Eliane Radigue’s Trilogie de la Mort – they’re so easy to fall into. It’s deceptively charming music, even though it has a lot of dissonance. I love the empty spaces in Triadic Memories. There’s something really powerful when the notes punctuate the space, and in how beautiful the decay of each of the notes can be. Trilogie de la Mort you can get lost in. It reminds me of David Lynch’s obsession with electricity, it has that kind of spiritualised voltage feeling.I’m also listening to Chee Shimizu and Charlie Bones’s NTS radio shows. I love the communal aspect of Charlie’s show, when people call in and have to sing the tune that they want to hear.

With junior roles now also filled, he has brought more than a dozen Labour MPs who sat out the Jeremy Corbyn era or resigned in 2016 back onto the party’s frontbench.They include the former leadership candidate Jess Phillips, who will be a shadow home office minister covering domestic violence and safeguarding.Liz Kendall, who made a centrist pitch for the leadership in 2015 but lost out to Corbyn, will be shadow social care minister, and Alison McGovern, the chair of the Labour campaign group Progress and a keen footballer, will be shadow sports minister.There are also jobs for many young Labour leftwingers, including Alex Sobel and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who will cover tourism and the natural environment respectively.Starmer’s campaign chief, Jenny Chapman, a former MP who lost her Darlington seat in December, tweeted: “This is what unity looks like.”The shadow Treasury team in particular appears to  the breadth of the party. The Liverpool Walton MP, Dan Carden, a former aide to Len McCluskey who was Corbyn’s shadow development secretary, is shadow financial secretary.He will serve alongside Wes Streeting, the Ilford North MP who was a vociferous critic of Corbyn’s leadership, and Pat McFadden, whom Corbyn sacked as Europe minister in 2016.Some of the most vociferous champions of a second Brexit referendum, including the Cardiff South MP, Stephen Doughty, have also been given frontbench roles. Doughty, who previously worked for Oxfam, will be shadow Africa minister.Rayner had already been named as Labour chair, but Starmer’s announcement that she would deputise for him at PMQs and in other key functions will ensure she has a prominent public role.Rayner had been widely seen as a potential leadership candidate after Corbyn promised to step down following the party’s general election defeat, but she stepped aside in favour of her close friend Rebecca Long-Bailey.She is a robust parliamentary performer. She was also more blunt in criticising Boris Johnson during the general election campaign than Corbyn, who stuck to his mantra of “they go low, we go high”.Rayner, who was a single mother at the age of 16, called scathing remarks by Johnson about the children of single mothers, which were unearthed during the campaign, disgusting.Starmer has signalled his willingness to take a constructive approach to working with the government to tackle the coronavirus crisis, but allies insist it is a fantasy that Labour could join a government of national unity as some Conservative backbenchers have suggested.Shadow cabinet members have been asked to make contact with their opposite numbers in government, and several have done so by raising issues of concern in the way the crisis is being dealt with.The new shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has already peppered Rishi Sunak with questions about the Treasury’s economic rescue package.It is unclear in what form parliament will return after the Easter recess.

It means, among other things, that members of the House will be able to use video conferencing to dial in remotely to parliamentary proceedings.The Lords authorities also plan to re-examine how much members receive in allowances given that they will not be expected to travel to attend the Palace of Westminster.Signed by Lord Speaker Fowler as well as the upper chamber’s political leaders, the letter said they had agreed that oral statements and oral questions should be conducted online from 21 April. They said they plan to ensure that general debates and certain stages of legislation will also be held virtually at some point in the future.The letter, signed by Fowler, Labour’s leader of the opposition Baroness Smith, the leader of the Liberal Democrats’ in the Lords Lord Newby and the Conservatives’ leader of the house Baroness Evans, said that initially, participation in virtual proceeds would be limited, with a view to expansion in the future.“The leaders, convenor and Lord Speaker have agreed that as a priority oral questions and oral statements should be, as much as possible, held virtually. A number of committees have been doing some of their work remotely over this period and that will continue once the house returns.“For fully virtual sessions, there may need to be a limit on the number being held each day to ensure Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS) resources are available, but work on this continues.“We are also working towards a position in which other types of business – general debates, certain stages of legislation – can be undertaken virtually, but we are going to have to make progress on a step-by-step basis,” the letter said.Mindful that some of the chamber’s older members may struggle with technology – their average age is 70, according to data from 2019 - the letter urges peers to acquaint themselves with Microsoft Teams so that they can participate.“We would strongly encourage all members to use the period before the house meets to familiarise themselves with the platform as this will be the means by which members can participate in any virtual proceedings,” it said.The body overseeing the House of Lords will also re-examine how much peers receive in allowances under the new system, according to the letter. At present, they can opt to receive an allowance of £313 per day, plus travel expenses and subsidised restaurant facilities.“In view of the fact we intend a significant amount of business to be able to take place virtually, after Easter the House of Lords commission will look at how the allowances system can be adapted to reflect this new, temporary way of working,” it said.One option could be for peers to be allowed to claim a half-rate, which is currently allowed for work away from Westminster.Parliament closed early for Easter as members in the Palace of Westminster sought to abide by social distancing measures to slow the spread of Covid-19.Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, announced last week that the government and parliament hoped that appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs also return. It followed demands for a virtual lower chamber from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64da9e65147a06a46c179c1e902f6d034f82d3c4/0_246_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cea9f7afecdaf304eac6a44eff675e47","title":"labour corbynites seek to regroup after keir starmer victory","story":"Richard Burgon hopes to relaunch Campaign Group, potentially with John McDonnell’s supportThe Labour MP Richard Burgon hopes to relaunch the socialist Campaign Group as a leftwing rival to the Fabian Society, as Corbynites seek to regroup following Keir Starmer’s leadership victory.“It’s a platform which he will extend and build on, to keep putting those ideas forward,” said an ally, who underlined the comparison with the Fabians.Burgon’s most eye-catching policy was the idea that Labour members should be given a vote on whether the party’s leader should support any military action not backed by the UN. He called it a “peace pledge”.Allies say he and John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, are working to beef up the longstanding Campaign Group, the caucus of socialist MPs behind Corbyn’s candidacy for the leadership in 2015.The revamped organisation is expected to organise events and produce research and policy recommendations, as well as providing allied MPs with support. Burgon expects to play a leading role.The Fabian Society, founded in 1884 to “educate, agitate, organise”, was involved in the creation of the Labour party and has remained affiliated to it, publishing research papers and acting as what it calls a “pluralist, non-factional forum” for developing political ideas.Starmer’s shadow cabinet includes 15 Fabian members, according to the society.Momentum, the grassroots campaign group Jon Lansman set up to support Corbyn’s leadership, is also under pressure to reinvent itself after failing to propel its chosen candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, into Labour’s top job.Senior Momentum officials issued a statement on Tuesday saying the organisation could not continue as it had been, calling for “unity, reflection and comradely debate on the way forward”.“At the present moment, our movement is in great peril of making the same mistakes we did after our defeat in the 1980s. We risk retreating from the challenge of making our ideas mainstream, fighting between ourselves and allowing our party to be taken over once more by centrists,” the statement said.It appeared to be an attempt to pre-empt the launch the next day of a ginger group called Forward Momentum, which is calling for movement to be more grassroots-led and democratic, and less London-centric.The group is expected to stand candidates for election to Momentum’s national governing council in May, in what appears to be an attempt to dilute Lansman’s control.As well as failing to back the winner in the leadership race, Momentum’s candidates were defeated in parallel elections for two seats on Labour’s governing national executive committee (NEC).The NEC has sweeping powers over party processes and policies. It took Corbyn more than two years to achieve a consistent majority on it.A spokesperson for Momentum said: “We want to see a Labour government and we will use our campaigning tools to make that happen. We’ll continue to push big ideas. And we are going to work to ensure that Keir sticks to his promises.”His shadow cabinet reshuffle, however, involved a comprehensive clearout of close Corbyn allies, with Burgon joining Jon Trickett, Dan Carden and Ian Lavery on the backbenches. Diane Abbott and John McDonnell had already made clear they would step aside.Long-Bailey, who came second in the leadership contest, was one of the only survivors from the Campaign Group, and will now serve as shadow education secretary.Many Labour veterans see the hand of the canny political strategist McDonnell behind manoeuvres now taking place to ensure leftwing voices remain prominent.“John is mobilising on several fronts, and he’s adept at using proxies and ciphers,” said one senior party insider, joking that the shadow chancellor was “retiring to spend more time on politicking”.Another suggested McDonnell and Burgon were coordinating their efforts, and would take a “comradely” approach to Starmer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827878f5af63756304642a4f33369f4b33f1ae99/0_447_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d0e64a0765da07cc4d52af362ce3ded","title":"raab patel downing street press briefing women","story":"Asked to rise to the occasion for the third time in a week, Random Raab almost produced some coherent sentencesCoronavirus is man’s work. At least, that appears to be the government’s assessment of it, for in the three weeks of daily Downing Street press briefings, not once has a woman minister been allowed out to be front-of-house compere. Priti Patel, Liz Truss and Thérèse Coffey have become all but invisible. Missing in action. They might as well not exist.For the third time this week it was Dominic Raab – the de facto prime minister while Boris Johnson is in intensive care – who did the business for the government. And, to be fair, he’s getting visibly better at it. He looks less unstable and more the man who can easily see out 24 hours of close police interrogation over unsolved missing persons cases. Though he might have struggled if anyone had questioned him about the disappearance of the home secretary.It also helped that the foreign secretary didn’t have any news, other than the grim daily death statistics, to impart. So he could stick to doing what he knows best, which is spilling out a random series of words, only some of which amount to fully coherent sentences. At some point in his career, the black-belt martial arts specialist is going to have to realise that the brain is also a muscle. Coming up with lines like “We are focusing on the things we need to focus on” may sound impressive at cabinet meetings, but doesn’t translate well to those of us who speak human.Still, after Raab had spent the best part of five minutes telling everyone to stay at home for Easter – the No 10 lectern had been helpfully updated with this new logo – it did become clear why Patel might have dodged a bullet by being excluded from this briefing. Because Raab went on to deliver a long thank-you to all the NHS staff, care workers, hospital cleaners, delivery drivers and supermarket staff who were keeping people alive and the country running: the very people who would never have been let into the country if the home secretary had been allowed to implement her points-based immigration system a few years earlier. For Priti, ideology is all. She didn’t vote to take back control to have an immigrant clean a hospital floor or operate a supermarket checkout.“We now know who the key workers really are,” said Raab. Indeed we did. And to the surprise of many Tory MPs, they weren’t the hedge-fund managers or party donors they had imagined. Here Raab’s legendary ability to dissociate came in handy. Because back in 2010, he, Patel and several other leading Tories wrote a book, Britannia Unchained, in which they advocated increased austerity, doubling down on laissez-faire economics and branded the Brits as some of the idlest people in the world.But some things don’t change. Asked if the government might care to show its gratitude to the key workers with a cash bonus once the pandemic was over, Raab became evasive. Money, what money? Wasn’t it enough for these workers to have saved the country before being asked to leave? At times like these, Dom could almost be a double for David Brent. “The bad news is that some of you will lose your jobs. On a more positive note, the good news is that I’ve been promoted – so every cloud, eh?”Not that Raab seemed overly keen to emphasise the extent of his new powers as de facto prime minister. If anything, he tried to downplay them, suggesting that all cabinet decisions were now more like tantric meditation sessions. Unfortunately, the answers provided by that process can be less than crystal clear. Raab was as evasive on what the government strategy for determining the timing of the end of the partial lockdown might be – journalists have long since given up asking for an actual date – as he was on why the government had had to increase its overdraft with the Bank of England. Where was Rishi when you needed him?You could almost sense the desperation in Dom’s voice as he pleaded one last time for calm over Easter. Being in charge isn’t nearly so much fun as he had imagined. He’s missing Boris badly. Weirdly, I am too. At least with Boris you get some kind of hopeful bollocks. With Raab you just get bollocks. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c6b28f21f6c35e99723d55a64af5e9658fa8a4/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1cb9c9b70435a511c2208f1b0085de5","title":"uk lockdown could end with sector by sector plan for firms","story":"Industries like manufacturing could return to normal before entertainment companies, according to Whitehall sourcesMinisters are looking at ending the coronavirus lockdown with a “gradual sector-by-sector approach” that could see vital industries such as manufacturing get back to work before less critical ones like entertainment, according to Whitehall sources.Two officials said one of the main options being explored for ending the lockdown was the idea of a phased return by industry, with civil servants in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy among those looking at how it could work.With UK-wide deaths at almost 900 a day, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, confirmed on Thursday that measures to stem the spread of the disease would remain in place until there is evidence that the number of fatalities has reached its peak.Raab – who is deputising for the prime minister while he remains in hospital with Covid-19 – told the daily Downing Street press conference that it was too early to lift the restrictions on people’s daily lives, without saying how long they would last for. “We are not done yet. We must keep going,” he said.“It’s been almost three weeks and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place. We must stick to the plan and we must continue to be guided by the science.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 Downing Street has repeatedly refused to set out the options for how the UK could end the lockdown, but insisted that the government was doing “extensive work” on the various possibilities.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “Work is underway on an exit strategy but the public wants us to be focused on stopping the spread of the disease while building up the NHS and saving lives … Whitehall is working extensively on this but the peak is not reached and the government needs to focus in its public messaging on staying at home to save lives.”Officials acknowledge it could be difficult to rank sectors according to their importance to the economy, how much social contact they involve and the strength of their protective measures to keep people apart.But they said it was more possible than other ideas that have been floated in recent days, such as letting 20 to 30-year-olds go back to their normal lives before older people.Other ideas that have been raised by government scientists include “alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures” for most of the year or providing “immunity passports” to those who have had the disease, although that would only work with a functioning home antibody test.The lockdown measures – which were announced on 23 March – were first scheduled to be reviewed after three weeks, on Easter Monday. The legislation drawn up to implement the lockdown must be reviewed at least once every 21 days, making 16 April the latest this can be done.Raab chaired a Cobra emergency committee on Thursday afternoon to discuss the lockdown with leaders of the devolved nations and the mayor of London. He said on Thursday evening that the government did not expect to say more about the possible easing of physical distancing measures until the end of next week.It is understood that tightening the lockdown is under greater consideration at this point, although Priti Patel, the home secretary, told TalkRadio on Thursday that the government was “absolutely not” considering any further physical distancing measures.One official said some Tory ministers and advisers have been pushing for the lockdown to end sooner rather than later, but that the current thinking was that it would have to last for another six to eight weeks.Boris Johnson’s hospital admission and spell in intensive care had undermined the case of those pushing for schools and workplaces to soon get back to normal, the source said.Industry leaders were briefed at the end of last week on the government’s ideas about a possible sector-by-sector approach when the lockdown ends, with manufacturing, logistics and food supply companies likely to be at the front of the queue if they are not still open already.One person familiar with the government’s thinking said that the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, was concerned about the idea, fearing compliance with the rules would collapse once the public could see workers from some sectors returning to a more normal life.The government’s scientific advisers remain particularly concerned about the risk of a second wave of infections if the rules are relaxed too soon, the source said – but Whitehall officials are conscious of the prime minister’s desire to see them loosened as soon as possible.Johnson and his ministers have acknowledged that widespread testing will be part of the answer, but the scientific advisers have said the capacity to roll out mass testing for live cases across the population is unlikely.Labour is pushing for the government to publish an exit strategy even though the end of the lockdown is likely to be some way off, as the public would need to have confidence in the approach and time to get used to the idea.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the recently appointed shadow home secretary, said: “While we acknowledge the difficulty in putting precise times on the strategy, one of the key reasons publication is necessary is to enable frontline emergency services to plan effectively.“This is especially important in areas such as policing, where clear plans will need to be in place to ensure a managed process. That is why I urge the home secretary to help get an exit strategy published, as it’s a vital part of securing public confidence in the government’s approach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f588250368e92ebfa523cc52642da69d166e30d/0_0_3063_1838/master/3063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02582ec35c4a061237de1761583b6c42","title":"april pink full moon readers photos of the supermoon","story":"A supermoon happens when the moon reaches the closest point to Earth in its 27-day orbit and it happens to be full, which usually occurs once a year.

What options are available?Young workers are among the most resilient to the virus, but often the hardest hit financially. A “youth first” policy would aim to release them first, at least in part, so they can get back to work and soften the financial impact of the epidemic. Research from Warwick University this week made the case for easing restrictions on people in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents. Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee estimate that the move would allow 4.2m people to return work, 2.6m of whom are in the private sector, and get the economy moving again. “A young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country,” the authors write.As recent deaths have shown, however, the young are not impervious to the disease. The Warwick group calculate that their youth-first policy could lead to 630 premature deaths. But if all goes well, others could follow them back to the workplace, their order determined by age and type of work.Shutting schools reduces the spread of coronavirus among pupils and teachers breaking up the social bonds that inevitably build up between parents. But it has a significant impact on economic activity, as so many working parents need time off for childcare and home schooling.An influential review published this week found a “remarkable dearth” of data on the value of school closures during the outbreaks of Sars and Mers, but noted that the measure seemed to have relatively little impact on the spread of those coronaviruses.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.More sophisticated options are available than simply reopening schools en masse, which would risk fuelling a second wave of infections. A more cautious approach may see schools staggering their opening hours, lunch and break times, keeping playgrounds closed and class groups constant, introducing more space between students and having a shorter school week.There is a case for opening primary schools first: they tend to be smaller than secondaries and it is predominantly younger children who keep adults from working. That said, the impact of closures on mental health and education are more severe for secondary students.“One problem is that we don’t have much information to guide us,” said Professor Russell Vine at UCL, an author of the review. “We need to get the clever modellers looking at this, and looking at how these might interact with other elements. But I think society also need to discuss it.”Britain desperately wants an effective antibody test that reveals who has had the virus. Those who test positive for coronavirus antibodies will presumably have some immunity and in principle might be allowed back to work. It could make a dramatic difference for NHS staff and other carers who work with vulnerable people.Immunity passports are not straightforward, though. A positive antibody test does not mean someone is well protected, or protected for long. What the immune response means in the case of this particular disease is still unknown. Another concern with immunity passports is that they blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.A gradual easing of restrictions on shops and businesses would help the economy, but the spectre of a second wave of infections is ever present. Certain types of shops could reopen, but with strict limits on hours and numbers. The construction and manufacturing industries have already been sent new guidance from Alok Sharma, the business secretary, who said work could continue if done in line with social distancing rules “wherever possible”.Health officials will be watching European countries that are stating to relax their own lockdowns. In Austria, where new cases have been falling for some days, the schools will remain closed, but small shops, DIY and garden centres are due to reopen after Easter.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358f05c033c7fed77e6c33337e09d9486a46d59d/0_70_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91176f87a5d0c33fbc5b8e6d877e6fc8","title":"andy murray virtual madrid open tennis covid 19","story":"Andy Murray will swap a tennis racket for a games controller when he takes part in a virtual Madrid Open later this month.The Scot and Lucas Pouille were announced as the first two ATP players in the draw on Thursday night, as the tennis world raises money during the coronavirus pandemic.

Giles, the England team director, believes his players will be ready for action despite the uncertainty and being restricted to only one trip out per day for exercise.“We have to hang on to the hopewe will get out there and we will play,” Giles said. “It’s looking less and less likely that we’re going to be out there in June so we have to look at alternatives.“The one thing I ask of the players is there is no real excuse why you can’t keep yourself fit during this period. You could be jumping up and down in your front room, you can still go for a jog, you can use your home equipment – there’s a range of stuff so that our players are ready when we get that green light.”England’s medical team have told Giles four to eight weeks of conditioning are still required before a player can go from lockdown to playing international cricket. The catch here is what form the domestic game takes on resumption, with priority given to the T20 Blast and uncertainty over the County Championship.It means England’s red-ball cricketers may be forced to stage inter-squad matches to tune up, something Australia claimed to benefit from last year when they played among themselves in Southampton before an Ashes series they went on to draw.Giles said: “I think that would be a decent way around a problem if we weren’t playing cricket more broadly. All 18 county grounds are still up and running and their ground staff are in preparing pitches. We will do whatever we can, as long as our people are safe, to play cricket.”Among the possible scenarios for a truncated season, given the West Indies tour is followed by visits from Australia, Pakistan and Ireland, is the prospect of England’s Test and one-day international teams playing concurrently. Giles said they must be amenable to this, even if he ruled out such matches occurring on the same day.With a World Test Championship under way but England’s white-ball side trying to tune up for a possible T20 World Cup in October, the selectors may face a balancing act. Giles hinted at Tests taking priority but there is a chance multi-format players may feature in both, depending on the workload.On the subject of England’s centrally contracted players donating £500,000 to the coffers and good causes – a precursor to the wider county game accepting pay cuts and use of the government furlough scheme in places – Giles said: “I’m very proud of our players, full stop. I think they are fantastic role models and what they’ve done in terms of contribution was strong. It’s important from a number of different aspects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd8f28b504cd21dbcafa2b075c2dfecc92848ec/1387_27_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7dab84ac31738c12fbec3432f87c41e","title":"comedy online coronavirus lockdown facebook whatsapp iain stirling jayde adams","story":"From Iain Stirling’s Fifa banter to Jayde Adams live from her lounge, comedians isolated by the lockdown are reaching audiences onlineFor Scottish comedian and Love Island narrator Iain Stirling, nothing compares to live standup comedy. “Telling the audience something that you find bizarre or idiosyncratic about your life and psyche, and having a roomful of people going: Ha ha ha! We’re like that as well!” He laughs at the relief it brings. “You go, thank God!”The coronavirus lockdown means it could be months until standups are able to hear the roar of laughter in comedy clubs again. Meanwhile, many are making the most of online platforms. Stirling, whose UK tour dates have been postponed, is live-streaming to his fans on Twitch, which principally involves chatting about gaming while he plays Fifa. Many of us are only just discovering networks such as Zoom and Houseparty during confinement, but Stirling was an early adopter and uses Twitch when working away from home on Love Island.“You know in the American local news there’s those articles about the guy from Arizona who has built a zombie apocalypse bunker and everyone’s like, ‘What have you built that for?’” When the worst happens, he says, everyone wants their own bunker. “That’s how I feel about comedy and Twitch.”Some have subscribed to his channel for so long that “you get to know people and what they’re up to”. He ends sessions with a raid, which sends his viewers to another live channel. “I’ll find someone with fewer than 10 viewers and a decent size webcam. Then I chuck 500-odd people into their chat. Sometimes they’re playing League of Legends with their mates and resent it.” He laughs. “Generally, it’s good.”It may not be the same as performing to a sold-out comedy crowd but Twitch “scratches the itch” when Stirling is missing standup. His partner, the presenter Laura Whitmore, “has noticed I’ve stopped doing material at her in the kitchen, which is good”.For some, online comedy offers escapism during confinement. Alexis Strum’s new podcast, The Funny Women Survival Guide, is specifically designed to uplift. Strum introduces herself as a writer and performer, then adds newly discovered roles as home-schooler and hairdresser that will be relatable for many. With subjects in the first episode including being upstaged by your pet on conference calls, she describes her podcast as an attempt “to cheer up the nation”.Taskmaster’s Alex Horne is challenging the nation with Home Tasking, a series of eccentric assignments – “Throw a piece of paper into a bin spectacularly”, “Make the best dancing elephant” – to keep families entertained. Participants share videos of their attempts and a modest prize is promised. (“Something nice,” says Horne. “Not a car.”)Standup Philip Simon had gigs and a TV commercial cancelled because of the crisis, so to give himself – and others with kids – “a little focus”, he established School’s Out Comedy Club. Simon invites children to submit jokes, which he says develops their creative writing skills, and he performs them to camera. Some children submit videos of themselves telling gags. The next episode is dedicated to the NHS so “doctor, doctor” jokes are welcome.Standup Kae Kurd has a nice line in funny videos about stressed dads cutting their kids’ hair and helping with homework. Kurd doesn’t have children – he is in isolation with his brothers – but he has a lot of friends with kids and knows what they are going through. “It’s funny seeing how parents are dealing with this. At first they’re like, ‘The structure is really important.’ After a week, it’s like, ‘Can you just stay in your room and not accidentally stab yourself?’”Kurd has been prolific at sharing homemade funnies but says standups in the UK haven’t tended to focus on making material specially for online. “We’re similar to New York comics in the sense that we can make a living off gigs. But if you look at comics from LA, they have to work on web series and podcasts, too.” He is sharing videos on social media to build his audience, but it’s also a coping mechanism. Plus, he doesn’t want to be doing material about the lockdown when it’s over and he goes on tour. “I might as well get these ideas out while I can when we’re all going through it. The last thing people will want to hear afterwards is, “Remember corona?’ I can already imagine the jokes: ‘I was self-isolating, which is like The Hunger Games but with my cat …’ Get away from me, man. I don’t want to hear any of that crap.”Creating viral comedy is “a distinctly different skill” to standup, he says. If he has a good idea, “I just try it and see how people receive it. You will know from the views and engagement levels what works better.” It’s an accelerated process of preparing new material to try at a gig – you can film instantly at home and get an immediate response online.Viewers are visiting many comedians’ homes during the lockdown. Jayde Adams is hosting a weekly half-hour “couch cabaret” on Facebook Live from her living room (a treasure trove of fabulousness with a plush blue sofa). Her first show included singing sisters Flo \u0026amp Joan harmonising through isolation, Rose Matafeo doing a Phantom of the Opera number with a pair of glove puppets, and Steve Bugeja’s predictions for life after lockdown. (“Dogs will get excited when we leave for work, not when we get home.”) Adams featured in a sketch imagining the unfortunate effects of Joe Wicks’s stomping exercises for his neighbours. The show was watched by audiences around the world, from Adams’ home town of Bristol to the US, where her Amazon Prime show, Serious Black Jumper, is a hit and led to a surge of interest on TikTok.Adams says she’s fortunate because, unlike a lot of comedians on the circuit, she has television and radio work, too, and doesn’t rely purely on live shows. She acknowledges that standup online can be very difficult to pull off without an audience in the room because you usually “ride their laughter like a surfer”.Her cabaret gives a platform to comedians, musicians and dancers who may not otherwise have the technical knowhow to share work and successfully find audiences online. She decided to put together a variety bill for locked-in audiences because that’s the entertainment she remembers watching at home with her family as a child – though you’d imagine that those TV cabaret shows didn’t feature, as hers does, a man named Pudding wearing a gimp suit. Pudding is Adams’ boyfriend, comedian Rich Wilson. They are sharing their home with another comedian, Paul Sweeney, and film and edit the show themselves. The trio also have an online pub quiz and gin club.Kiri Pritchard-McLean is compering Saturday night gigs on Zoom, with proceeds being split between performers and charity. The lineups combine established names and “gems from the circuit”, with tickets being sold for £2 or £10 if you want a “front row” ticket, which allows you to share your screen and chat to her. She points out that it is a comedy bill curated by a comedian rather than a producer, so her bills will reflect a wider pool of talent from the comedy circuit than a TV producer’s might.Even BBC regulars such as Have I Got News for You and The Mash Report are bringing together hosts and guests from their lounges and spare rooms. Aspiring comedy producer Andy Ash has been quick to develop his own format, which he describes as “a social distancing panel show with isolated comedians”. WhatsApp’ening is hosted by Mark O’Sullivan from Lee and Dean, and its panelists must separate fact from fiction. The game is played via a WhatsApp group chat and the loser forfeits control of their WhatsApp so the winner can send messages to whoever they like. Episode one featured Stevie Martin (sporting a stylish eyepatch due to an infection), Jacob Hawley, Nic Sampson and Lauren Pattison, who is in lockdown at her childhood home.Some of Ash’s guests had Edinburgh fringe shows lined up and he recognises that the festival’s cancellation is an “immeasurable blow” for many comedians. He fears the climate threatens artistic aspirations “particularly if you come from a poorer background”. He says that, as well as donating to funds for freelance creatives, it can also be productive to “invest in something creative and funny”. Ash became involved in comedy production as a way of dealing with grief after his mother died in 2016. “I decided I wanted to be a part of making people happy, bringing laughter to them,” he says. During lockdown, “now more than ever we need something to laugh at, to be joyous about”. The nimble world of online comedy content, which can be swiftly created, widely shared and is vital as clubs remain closed, could introduce a new wave of comedians to audiences. Ash points to the boom in bedroom music production in the 90s and how it created a revolution. “Maybe this could be a moment for comedy, too. I certainly hope so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c65b0d722bf8527f606b217a9849f4c03bd3d0e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25340d45389eeed57a72c647303e2e94","title":"the swan birmingham royal ballet lockdown","story":"Watch a short solo from Birmingham Royal Ballet performed by a dancer and two musicians in their own homes • Hottest front-room seats: the best theatre and dance to watch onlineThe dancing lasts less than three minutes, but it’s just the fillip we need right now a gem of a moment to pull focus in often otherwise blurry days. The Swan is a lockdown offering from Birmingham Royal Ballet. Relayed in split-screen, a pianist (Jonathan Higgins), cellist (António Novais) and dancer (Céline Gittens) – all in their separate homes – perform Mikhail Fokine’s The Dying Swan, with a surprise ending.The short solo, set to Saint-Saëns’ Le Cygne, was created in 1905 for the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova, and it captures the ephemeral otherworldliness of the ballerina’s art, as well as ballet’s enduring image of the fluttering, beautifully doomed white swan.There’s great intimacy in inviting an audience into your home, close enough to Gittens to see the seams of her tights. Just as well, this solo is all about the details: the barely moving bourrées set to a gentle simmer, the slightest acceleration or pause in the swoop of her arms, the engrossing undulations of shoulder blades. There’s a single moment of melodrama when an arm is flung to the floor and Gittens looks like a silent-movie heroine.A choreographic intervention by BRB director Carlos Acosta means this is no longer a dying swan but one who, in the final moments, raises her head, hand and heart in hope. It sounds cheesy, but it’s lovely. When a dancer herself is transported, so can we be, too.There’s something pleasantly jarring about the combination of sublime art and prosaic domestic details – radiator, light switch, the pot plant Gittens brushes past as she dances into frame. This collision of the ordinary and the exceptional, the magical and mundane, brings human connection and fantastical escapism all in the space of 165 seconds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/139be9345aa1db39487d771750f99962c2865dd0/320_430_4995_2998/master/4995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=863a0d8c729727a69d0600edd4ad2eec","title":"send travel photo story win 200 pounds sawdays stay readers tips","story":"Whether it’s a spectacular shot or a fun picture that captures a special moment, we want to see your best travel snap and hear the story behind itWith all of us confined to our homes for the near future, this week we are asking for reminiscences of your great holidays through photography – a lovely way of recalling past travel glories.

Then the coronavirus happened For years, Mary P was employed by a major firm, cleaning its executive offices in Kansas City. Then, out of the blue a decade ago, the mother of three was told she was working for a different company.Mary P would carry on cleaning the same offices, but over time, while executives whose desks she was polishing continued to enjoy the fruits of their company’s fortunes, she saw her pay erode, healthcare coverage diminish, and what had seemed a secure job turn into an ad hoc position with few protections.Then coronavirus made its appearance.“They told me to go home. They would call me if they needed me. I won’t get paid. The health insurance only lasts until the end of the month,” said Mary P, who did not wish to be identified because she hopes to return to her job.Had coronavirus hit 15 years ago, she reckons she would have been in the same position as those whose offices she cleaned – at home, collecting salaries, reassured by good health coverage if they fall sick. But now she is cut adrift.“I can apply for food stamps and unemployment, but it won’t pay the rent. I’m really afraid of what happens if I get sick. I will just have to stay home. I can’t afford to pay for a doctor,” she said.As millions of Americans apply for unemployment benefits, the coronavirus pandemic has brutally laid bare the extent of US’s growing inequality, not only between the super rich and the rest of the country, but in the quality of jobs and the social protections that come with them.Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said: “It has drawn into focus those disparities in a way that it’s not just about jobs, it’s not just about wages. It’s about health and working conditions and access to health insurance. All of these things highlight that there’s two different societies in this country. Because of rising inequality, more people are vulnerable.”The US is not alone in face a huge surge in unemployment because of the pandemic. But American workers are particularly vulnerable because they have neither the welfare safety nets afforded by France or Germany, nor the public healthcare of the UK and Canada. The rise of outsourcing, contract work and gig economy jobs has seen ever increasing numbers of workers exposed to sudden economic shock, whether because of a financial crisis or a pandemic.Coronavirus has also thrown a spotlight on the president’s claims of a strong economy when so many American workers lack the resources to cope with even a brief period without work. A Federal Reserve survey last year said four in 10 workers would struggle to find $400 in an emergency, with out-of-pocket medical expenses presenting a particular hardship.Pat “Duke” Dujakovich, the president of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO union confederation, said large numbers of his members were suddenly put out of work and now face an uncertain future with many of them losing their healthcare coverage in the middle of a national medical emergency.Dujakovich, who was a firefighter for 30 years, said he saw what was to come on a single day after a series of concerts and sporting events in Kansas City were called off because of coronavirus.“Everything got cancelled on a Wednesday. Thursday, the stage hands tore down what they had already set up, and that is the last time any of them worked anywhere in the region. They were the first ones to go and they’ve been out of work for quite a while.”To Gould, the crisis has been deepened by companies shedding responsibility.“Part of this is about employers not taking responsibility for people that should really be on their books, whether or not they’re gig workers, contract workers, self-employed workers. Those people are actually employees and they should be treated like employees,” she said.Many of those workers lost their health insurance at the time they might most need it, with bills for coronavirus treatment potentially running into the tens of thousands of dollars. Laid-off workers are eligible to continue their coverage under a government scheme called Cobra. But Dujakovich said many would not be able to afford it.“I’m still trying to figure out how someone who just lost their job manages to scrape together $800 or a $1,000 a month to maintain those Cobra benefits,” he said. There is no way I have found for a person who is unemployed on their own to try to get healthcare in America. It just doesn’t exist. And so the only way is through employment.”But even those who still have jobs are vulnerable to inadequate protections.Gould said more than a quarter of private-sector workers in the US cannot claim paid time off for sickness.. That, she said, puts large numbers of people on low pay at increased risk of Covid-19, because many of them have little choice but to go on working, even if they show symptoms, increasing the likelihood of the virus spreading.“This virus exposes a vast inequality between the professional sector, white-collar workers, who are able to weather this at home with much less risk, have paid sick days if they need to take it, have health insurance,” said Gould. “And then there is another class of workers that has far fewer protections. Those that are more likely to be exposed because of their jobs, more likely to get sick, more likely have adverse consequences from getting sick because of rising inequality, because they don’t have paid sick days or health insurance.”Many of those same workers are also more likely to contract Covid-19 because they have jobs that bring them into contact with the public such as transport workers, shop assistants and carers, highlighted by the death of Jason Hargrove, a Detroit bus driver.Two weeks ago, Hargrove posted a Facebook video venting his anger at a passenger who coughed in his face several times.“For you to get on the bus, and stand on the bus, and cough several times without covering up your mouth, and you know that we’re in the middle of a pandemic, that lets me know that some folks don’t care,” he said.The 50 year-old father of six contracted coronavirus and died 11 days later.Gould said this goes some way to explain why African American communities have been so badly hit. Many black workers have jobs that make it difficult to isolate while minority communities also endure higher levels of medical conditions – diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure – that make people more vulnerable to coronavirus. African American communities also have a harder time obtaining good healthcare.“Even if they’re OK to go to work, and they’re healthy and strong, they could still be bringing home that disease to elderly family members or to family members that are at higher risk with heart conditions, with their asthma or whatever it might be.” Dujakovich said that while those at the top are better able to insulate themselves from coronavirus, he told a told a meeting of national AFL-CIO leaders that they will not be able to avoid its consequences.“I said right now the bankers don’t give a fuck about working people, but they’re going to give a fuck about us very shortly. When we stop making car payments and house payments and rent and all of those things, because working people have to prioritise,” he said.“When the first pay cheque is missed and the second pay cheque is questionable and the third pay cheque is really questionable, then you have to kind of think of things as to what can kill me first. I need to feed my family this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00bf46f0f2ed7030342c09c1e8c4d125cdf078d9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a80380e24b9b74f1e29267a80d3dba9","title":"benedictine nuns release gregorian chants to help ease coronavirus isolation","story":"French order opens abbey doors to allow what could be the largest recording project everA monastery of Benedictine nuns living in seclusion in southern France has opened its doors to allow recordings of its Gregorian chants to be made available to the outside world.In what is believed to be the largest recording project ever conducted, the US musician John Anderson followed the 45-strong order for three years. He installed microphones in the abbey church of Notre-Dame de Fidélité de Jouques near Aix-en-Provence in southern France and captured the nuns singing their eight daily “offices”. The result is thousands of chants, the entire Gregorian repertoire, about 7,000 hours long.The Gregorian chant originated in the 8th century and spread throughout Europe. It accords to St Benedict’s “rule”, in which the day is ided into balanced isions of manual and intellectual work, prayer and rest, starting at 5am with the chanting of matins, and concluding with compline at 8pm, followed by the “great silence” of night.The Jouques nuns’ lead a strict life of contemplation in which they recite the chants daily.The abbey, which has its own congregation, is closed for Easter as a result of rules applied to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “Because of the measures taken ... we can no longer admit worshippers to our abbey’s church, and we are deeply sorry for it,” the nuns said.They have instead allowed the release of a week’s worth of their chants https:www.neumz for the six days Christians refer to as holy week, preceding Easter Sunday, the highlight of the religious calendar, when the chants have a particular importance. The rest is to go live next month.The chants are presented together with their simple scores, Latin texts and translations, allowing subscribers to sing together with the nuns.Anderson was inspired by the Gregorian chants after an aunt joined the convent and he visited her during his summer holidays from university.“The community is living in communion with nature and in quiet contemplation. Their life is regularised by the rhythm of prayer and work,” he said. “The simple beauty of their singing” had had a profound influence on him, he said, and “on the sensation of time, the amount of focus it was possible to achieve in such tranquillity”.After negotiating with the nuns for a week, he and a sound technician suspended eight low-profile microphones in the church, which recorded into a small recorder that saved the music to SD cards.The nuns pressed “record” every time they entered the church and “stop” when they exited after each service. A 4G modem was installed at the monastery, enabling the nuns to upload the 24GB of contents to the technicians’ Google Drive account every evening, from where the recordings were mixed and mastered.Organised so as to be as minimally invasive to the nuns’ lives, the recordings of clear unaccompanied voices are speckled with authentic sounds such as the creak of wooden benches, the occasional coughing or dropping of prayer books and bell chimes.Anderson, a founder of Odradek Records originally from Kansas but now living in Italy, said the launch of the project, which was eight years in the making and would raise money for the order’s sister monastery in Benin, west Africa, had come at the right time, when many people were detached from their work and social contacts.“In these days of remote work and online social activity, we hope that listening to the chants of holy week can help bring people together, religious and non-, sharing in a sense of peace and enjoying their timeless beauty,” he said.“The sisters live this paradox already – in isolation but in continuous prayer for the rest of the world, and in community amongst themselves. These days we are maybe experiencing a similar sensation, to be physically isolated but sometimes even closer together emotionally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The ban was effective from 9pm the next day.That left visitors and visa holders stranded mid-journey, or turned around at the border and packed back on to planes, and left hundreds of thousands of Australians scrambling to get home, many of whom remain stuck in countries similarly locked down or without flights home.Australia and neighbouring New Zealand, almost unique among anglophone countries, have so far been successful in largely suppressing the spread of Covid-19 within their countries, and in particular, keeping deaths low.Australia, with a population of 25 million, has had just over 6,000 infections, and 50 deaths. New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, which closed its borders the day before Australia, has had 1,200 infections and so far only one death from Covid-19.Both countries have enacted strict physical distancing regimes, enforced by police. Planes have been grounded, workers have been told to stay home, schools have been closed in some places, and entire industries put into hibernation.And in both countries, the early decision, and the capability, to enforce a total lockdown of borders has proven crucial, buying valuable time to prepare, and allowing both nations to flatten the trajectory of their Covid-19 infection curves.“We have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas, whether it be initially in China in Wuhan, or in New York in the United States, or Italy, or Spain, or even the United Kingdom,” Morrison said this week. “But we must hold the course. We must lock in these gains.”Australia has inherent advantages. If a country were to be designed to withstand a viral pandemic such as Covid-19, it would look very much like Australia: geographically distant, a large island nation with borders than can be locked down, inhabited by a comparatively small population that lives, in the main, in low-density cities.Australia is wealthy, too, with a highly developed public health system, and a government sufficiently solvent to be able to turn on the tap of public monies to get its population through the months of lockdown. Legislation for $130bn (£65bn) in wage subsidies for those who have lost jobs because of the pandemic was passed by parliament this week, on top of $84bn in economic stimulus promised earlier.Australia also has had the advantage of watching the Covid-19 pandemic unfold in other countries. The delay has given it time to prepare its public health system – additional beds and staff have been readied for the coming peak– as well as its public. Internal restrictions have also been put in place. Australia’s states have closed their borders to each other for the first time since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.There have been significant and severe missteps, the most egregious being the decision in March to allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock at Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, allowing more than 2,700 passengers to disembark without testing, despite there being people with Covid-19 infections onboard.Another misstep was at Sydney airport. Just as physical distancing laws were being imposed across the country, social media videos showed border force officials corralling arriving passengers from all over the world to wait in cramped halls and tight queues.Apart from the impact of these failures on infection rates, they have damaged public confidence in the government’s measures. Just as the country, state by state, was being put into lockdown, governments were undermining their own messages to self-isolate to save lives.There has been, too, overreaction. In NSW, a man was fined by police for sitting on a park bench and eating a kebab. In Victoria, a learner driver practising with her mother was given a $1,600 fine, later rescinded after a backlash.But Australians have, by and large, tolerated the imposition of lockdowns. After thousands gathered at Bondi Beach on a warm autumnal Friday evening in March, it was summarily shut down and put under police guard. With occasional defiance, it has remained eerily deserted since.Ten days after New Zealand’s centre-left government closed its borders to foreign nationals it introduced some of the toughest lockdown measures in the world. No one had yet died and cases had just passed 100.“Stay home, save lives,” the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, urged her citizens, ordering them to remain in their homes for a month. “The situation here is moving at pace, and so must we. The trajectory is very clear, act now or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere.”Ardern said the worst-case scenario was “simply intolerable” – up to 80,000 dead, modelling predicted – representing the greatest loss of life in New Zealand’s history. “I will not take that chance,” Ardern said. “We’re going hard and we’re going early.”The nation was given two days to prepare, panic buying was widespread. But when the moment came – effective house arrest for the majority of the population – there was absolute quiet on the streets.Despite their reputation for having an independent streak and a benign disdain for authority, New Zealanders have been overwhelmingly compliant with the restrictive measures, with a total of 367 breaches recorded by police. Eager surfers and mountain bikers have caused the most persistent headaches, according to the police commissioner.New Zealand is one of the few countries worldwide to pursue an “elimination” strategy, and the plan has the backing of the scientific community, many of whom want the country to stay in a version of lockdown until a vaccine can be deployed.David Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said: “We could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks … we still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly.”Fellow Otago epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker is one of the key architects behind New Zealand’s coronavirus defence plan. He says an elimination strategy is well suited to an island state, where borders can be swiftly and effectively closed.Writing in the New Zealand Medical Journal, Baker said the strategy would save lives, but at huge social and economic cost, particularly “for those with the fewest resources”. “New Zealand society has made a large ‘upfront’ sacrifice in pursuing an elimination strategy,” he said.For the first 12 days of lockdown, the numbers of cases rose steadily, as predicted by health officials. But cases have been steadily declining, and the prime minister has said she is “cautiously optimistic” that the strategy is working.On Wednesday, New Zealand recorded its lowest number of new cases in a fortnight, one day after testing a record number of people. More people are now recovering from the disease than being infected by it, an “encouraging milestone”, the country’s director general of health said.Attention and anticipation is turning to a gradual exit from lockdown in late April. Ardern has said it is likely some regions of the country will remain in total lockdown, while regions with few or no cases will ease into more freedoms. The borders remain closed to foreign nationals, and mandatory quarantining of arrivals is to be introduced today.“We have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,” Ardern said.“But I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835ca0de47d1b0c4f370afaa524e8be3d0abcf2d/1075_407_1233_740/master/1233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d786d2fecdcdda8a766f5957be0982d7","title":"how did the coronavirus start where did it come from how did it spread humans was it really bats pangolins wuhan animal market","story":"It’s likely Covid-19 originated in bats, scientists say. But did it then spread to pangolins and humans?In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China’s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 80,000 people so far.Stock footage of pangolins – a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater – have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They’re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne’s Monash University, says what’s most likely is that virus originated in bats.But that’s where his certainty ends, he says.On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: “I don’t think it’s conclusive by any means.”“Part of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,” he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.The fact that the virus has infected a tiger in a New York zoo shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. “Understanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.”Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus – the 2002 Sars outbreak – moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says they are “the most illegally traded mammal in the world” and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.As reported in Nature, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it’s illegal to sell them.“Whether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it’s not clear,” Turner says. “It’s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it’s jumped into people and evolved in people.”Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a Nature study that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is “still uncertain”.One statistical study looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.Another study claimed to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.“Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,” the study said.This might be another reason to doubt the established story.Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental “cannot be ruled out” but that possibility “seems less likely” because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.Perlman told  Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they “are not proven to be the key intermediary”.So-called wet markets – where live animals are traded – have been implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, in particular Sars.Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19’s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It’s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.”“These wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,” she says. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.”Turner adds: “We’ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9d75a980eca0780d38e071fe56d6f9abee40baa/0_136_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14784ca6c9952df79dffef37e77a3d2","title":"uk coronavirus peak at least two weeks away chief scientist says","story":"Patrick Vallance says deaths likely to keep rising for fortnight after ICU situation improvesThe UK coronavirus death toll is expected to continue to rise for at least two weeks, the government’s chief scientific adviser has said, despite encouraging signs about the rate of infections and hospital admissions.Sir Patrick Vallance told Thursday’s daily Downing Street briefing that the number of people to have died from coronavirus in UK hospitals had reached 7,978, after the deaths of a further 881 people. It is the second-highest daily total after Wednesday’s record 938 deaths.Despite the slightly lower figure, Vallance said the peak of the outbreak could still be weeks away. “I would expect the deaths to continue to keep going up for about two weeks after the intensive care picture improves. We’re not there yet, but that’s the sort of timeframe I would expect.”The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, pointed out that two weeks ago admissions to intensive care were doubling every three days. He said: “It’s now becoming not quite flat, but doubling time is now six or more days in almost every area in the country. That has only happened because of what everybody has done in terms of staying at home.”The official UK figure of 881 new deaths differs from the 891 total from figures released separately by agencies in the UK’s four countries, which gather their data differently. NHS England said a further 765 people had died, ranging in age from 24 to 103. Only 43 of those patients had no known underlying health condition.Scotland recorded 81 deaths, taking its total to 447. Unlike the rest of the UK, Scotland’s total includes some deaths outside hospitals because it counts all fatalities where Covid-19 is recorded as a cause on a death certificate.Wales recorded 41 deaths, taking its total to 286 and in Northern Ireland there were four more deaths, taking its total to 82.Last week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the NHS was preparing for at least 1,000 deaths a day, at a time when scientific advisers were forecasting the outbreak to peak at Easter.The peak was now expected to come in four weeks, after signs that the transmission rate was beginning to fall. New infections continue to fluctuate. On Thursday, 4,344 new cases were recorded, compared with 5,492 on Wednesday, but the day-on-day rise was still higher than three of the previous four days.He added: “If deaths are still following a rapid exponential growth, today’s new deaths would have been expected to be markedly higher than yesterday’s, and the total number of deaths to date would have doubled from that four days ago. Most, if not all, the deaths reported today will have come from infections before the so-called ‘hard lockdown’. It does seem that the hard lockdown is, as expected, reducing the rate of increase in the number of new hospital admissions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The British prime minister has been moved out of intensive care but remains at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, Downing Street said.A spokesman for the Boris Johnson said: “The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits.”Johnson was transferred to an intensive care unit on Monday.The global death toll has passed 94,000 on the Johns Hopkins University tracker – the current figure is 94,807.The US has now overtaken Spain with over 16,000 deaths. Spain has 15,238, according to the Maryland-based university’s research.Italy is the country with the highest coronavirus-related deaths at 19,279.President Trump said that Pfizer has found a “promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating” and that it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials “very soon”.In a press conference, he added that through the FDA’s coronavirus treatment acceleration programme, 19 therapies and treatments are being tested and 26 more “are in the active planning for clinical trials”.However, there has been scepticism over Trump’s earlier claims for possible treatments including the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced it will extend its coronavirus lockdown by a further two weeks.He had imposed a 21-day total lockdown on the country’s 56 million inhabitants on 27 March, enforced by the police and the army.On Thursday, Ramaphosa said: “This evening, I stand before you to ask you to endure even longer. I have to ask you to make even greater sacrifices so that our country may survive this crisis and so that tens of thousands of lives may be saved.”The country has said the total death toll in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 12,210, from 10,869 on Wednesday, with care homes accounting for more than a third of all fatalities.The number of people in intensive care has fallen slightly for the first time since the start of the outbreak.Jérôme Salomon, head of the public health authority, said there were now 7,062 people in intensive care at hospitals, a net decrease of 82 from a day earlier.The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the American economy could start to reopen for business in May despite experts’ emphasis on prolonged physical distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus.Asked on CNBC whether he thought Donald Trump could reopen the economy so soon, Mnuchin said: “I do.”“As soon as the president feels comfortable with the medical issues, we are making everything necessary that American companies and American workers can be open for business.”The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state’s strict public health orders.It emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the government urging the public to delay non-essential travel.The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he did not break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home before the state lockdown came into effect.Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement on an emergency rescue package aimed at responding to the economic adversity triggered by coronavirus.Finance ministers from countries including the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and France clapped over their teleconference.“We acted decisively for our citizens in less than a month,” Mário Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister and president of the group, told his counterparts.The package includes a boost to the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new unemployment insurance scheme proposed by the European commission.The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection.Technical guidance notes seen by the  and briefings by top WHO officials warned of potential human-to-human transmission and made clear that there was a threat of catching the disease through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, based on the experience of earlier coronavirus outbreaks.Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying “there was no human-to-human transmission”.Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter’s Basilica.He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir.The pope said: “These days more than 60 (priests) have died here in Italy while taking care of the sick, in hospitals. Together with the doctors and nurses they are the saints next door.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f03da2c34da2dfc9dcf49a3dd210d462a45225b/0_140_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4c0dc2889b0a62c50053ee1e301a92","title":"leap of faith ancient britons viewed hares chickens as gods easter","story":"Iron age research reveals modern Easter festivals not first to celebrate chicks and bunniesBrown hares and chickens were revered as gods rather than reared for food when they were first introduced to Britain in the iron age, archaeological analysis suggests.In research that shows modern-day Easter festivals were not the first to celebrate chicks and bunnies, a team of experts from the universities of Exeter, Leicester and Oxford have found evidence that the animals were buried with care and intact in the period that preceded the Roman invasion of Britain.Historical evidence suggests Britons of the period associated the animals with deities and considered them too special to eat. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar’s firsthand account of the Gallic wars, says “the Britons consider it contrary to ine law to eat the hare, the chicken or the goose. They raise these, however, for their own amusement or pleasure.”Radiocarbon analysis of hare and chicken skeletons from a number of sites in Hampshire and Herefordshire backs up that assertion, showing that the two species were introduced simultaneously to Britain between the fifth and third centuries BC. Excavation has previously revealed the animals had been carefully buried without being butchered.Prof Naomi Sykes from the University of Exeter, who is leading the research, said: ““Easter is an important British festival, yet none of its iconic elements are native to Britain. The idea that chickens and hares initially had religious associations is not surprising as cross-cultural studies have shown that exotic things and animals are often given supernatural status.“Historical accounts have suggested chickens and hares were too special to be eaten and were instead associated with deities – chickens with an iron age god akin to Roman Mercury, and hares with an unknown female hare goddess. The religious association of hares and chickens endured throughout the Roman period.“However, archaeological evidence shows that as their populations increased, they were increasingly eaten, and hares were even farmed as livestock. Rather than being buried as iniduals, hare and chicken remains were then disposed of as food waste.”The cross-disciplinary academic team, whose objective is to investigate the origins of Easter traditions and the animals that have come to be associated with it, has previously revealed that the first rabbits were introduced to Britain not by the Normans, as was previously thought, but by the Romans, who arrived in the first century AD.Hares and chickens were both farmed for food during the Roman occupation of Britain, but in the economic collapse following the Roman withdrawal in 410AD rabbits became locally extinct and the populations of chickens and brown hares crashed.Historical and archaeological evidence show rabbits were reintroduced to Britain as an elite food by the Normans in the 11th century. Rabbits were increasingly common in the 19th century, probably contributing to their replacement of the hare as the Easter bunny when the festival’s traditions were reinvigorated by the Victorians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2661c89e7aa5ec016157d330a1628a3f2184abea/0_374_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd42984b448f84f5858cddca974999f","title":"wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown in pictures","story":"After 76 days sealed off from the world, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has opened its doors again.

All around us were jagged, brilliant white peaks, piercing blue glaciers and water flecked with such a constellation of ice fragments that you could imagine a sky-sized mirror had shattered on to the surface of the ocean.The pilot cut the outboard engine to reduce noise while the scientist, Tim Lewis, dropped the hydrophone – essentially a waterproof microphone on a long cable – into the ocean. We sat quietly as the boat bobbed and drifted to within a few metres of an iceberg the size of a church. Dozens of gentoo penguins swished in and out of the water. Further off, we could hear the intermittent rumbles of avalanches as mountain snow warmed and collapsed in the pale southern summer sun. But it was the underwater soundscape that we had come to hear. After playing out 20 metres of cable, Lewis took off his woolly hat, put on the headphones, closed his eyes and let his ears take him down to the depths. We watched his face for clues as to what he was hearing. First a frown. (Is the equipment working properly?) Then a look of bemusement. Finally a wry smile. “I have never heard anything like it. Not what I expected at all,” he said. “It sounds like dripping, like the inside of a gorge.”The earphones were passed from person to person. Everyone listened with a similar expression of concentration and offered their own interpretation of these strange sounds. “Drips in a drain,” said one of the activists. “Forest waterfall,” said the coxswain. “Rainfall on city streets,” said the camera operator.My turn came, and I, too, was transported. Not, it seemed, below the ocean, but into a vast cavern, where it sounded as if water was cascading from a high ceiling, each drip echoing through the emptiness.  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:uploads.guim20200408melting-glacier--trimmed.mp3 “That’s the sound of the iceberg melting,” Lewis informed us. When snow falls, he explained, pockets of air get trapped and then compressed inside glaciers over years, centuries, even millennia. “What you can hear are the pops as they are released,” he said. It was the opposite of what we imagined. Rather than water dripping down through air, we were listening to air escaping up through water. We were so close to the ice that this ancient fizz was surprisingly loud. Though we humans never hear it above the surface, this is the sound the Antarctic makes every summer. And as the planet heats, the sound is getting louder.It was mid-January, the peak of the Antarctic summer, and I had joined a broader 10-month, pole-to-pole expedition by scientists and campaigners on two Greenpeace ships, the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza. On this final leg around the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, nine researchers from British, French and US universities were measuring how human activity is disturbing the region’s natural equilibrium.With the help of 59 crew members – a mix of sailors, engineers and activists – the scientists conducted acoustic monitoring, environmental DNA sampling, testing for plastic microfibres, phytoplankton analysis, as well as surveys of penguin and whale populations. Just as the first explorers once charted coastlines voyage by voyage, the aim was to map Antarctic ecosystems. Many of the waters and islands we were visiting had not been surveyed for decades, if ever. I caught up with the Sunrise at King George’s Island, about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America. Home to an airfield, two churches, the research bases of 10 countries and about 500 semi-permanent residents, this international community has often been cast as the last hope of humanity in dystopian novels and films because of its remoteness, collaborative spirit and focus on science. (Today, coincidentally, Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a single case of coronavirus).But it is all too vulnerable to the other great global crisis – climate change. Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula – the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America – have risen by about 3C in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.“People think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,” Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile’s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile’s southernmost region. “The changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,” he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. “I have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,” he said. In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. “At least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,” he joked darkly.There will be other clues for the geologists of the future. On 24 December 2019, the Antarctic probably suffered its worst one-day ice melt since records began, according to analysis by the University of Liège. In February, a mainland record of 18.3C was registered at the Argentinian base on the tip of the peninsula. Days later, a continental high of 20.75C was measured at a monitoring station on Seymour Island. On that day, on that island, the Antarctic was hotter than Cape Town.For the first two days, we sailed south in serene conditions, gazing in wonder at the seascape and wildlife. You can glimpse more species in the average London garden than on this immense continent, which covers an area the size of the US and Mexico combined. But what its residents lack in variety, they make up for in numbers.That was clear from our first short excursion at Trinity Island, which lies 150 miles southwest of King George Island. There we came across a vast number of chattering penguins, grunting seals and squawking cormorants – along with a startling number of tourists. There, and at our next stop in Paradise Harbour, we saw six giant cruise liners in the space of four days, disgorging groups of whale watchers on dinghies, adventure holidaymakers on kayaks, and red-jacketed trekkers wandering through guano-stained slopes. This southern hemisphere summer – which was the 200th anniversary of the first sighting of the Antarctic – a record 80,000 tourists were expected in the continent, an almost threefold increase from 2015. Before the coronavirus pandemic, shipbuilders had been seeing strong demand for polar- and ice-class cruise liners. Luxury cruise operators have tried to outdo one another with heated deck “igloos”, underwater lounges and extendable viewing platforms. Tourists pay as much as $10,000 (£8,500) or even $20,000 to experience what brochures describe as “the Earth’s last great wilderness frontier”. For our hyper-dominant species, part of the attraction of Antarctica is the chance to feel small in the presence of the sublime, to return to a time when nature seemed like an awe-inspiring and nurturing mother rather than the frail and overburdened grandparent it increasingly resembles today. To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be “somewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel”.) If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife – five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina’s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak – a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. “It is all happening right in front of us – the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,” Zafiro said wistfully. Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship’s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about “solastalgia”, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. “You enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition. There is always the anticipation of loss, which makes me feels sad,” Rackete said. Solastalgia is hard to escape in the Antarctic.We passed three days in Paradise Harbour, going out daily in the boats to gather samples and look and listen for whales, seals and penguins. On our final night, I was reluctant to sleep, knowing this was the last chance to take it all in. As the sun’s pale afterglow faded behind the mountains, the dusky bay was as smooth as polished chrome. Time itself seemed to have frozen and I began to understand why so many of the early Antarctic explorers felt close to God here. After a few moments, my transcendental musings were interrupted by the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band echoing out from a huge cruise liner anchored 100 or so metres away. “That’s the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh” continued to ring in my ears as I made my way to the cabin.There are still some Antarctic islands that have rarely, if ever, been visited by humans. They are deemed too small, too plain, too remote or too storm-battered. Our destination the following day, Low, seemed to tick all of these boxes. This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales.

Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as “a Zen-like activity”.Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called “cocktail party effect”). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap’s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. “Such a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,” said Strycker.It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of salps – tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on phytoplankton – tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier – which covers an area similar to that of the UK – showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice five times faster than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were relieved to find that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will trap more heat, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross – the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him – knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. “Hitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,” he wrote in his diary in 1841.Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the International Whaling Commission. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia recorded 55 in just three weeks. For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world. But nobody is complacent. The actor Gustaf Skarsgård, who had joined the trip in order to promote conservation to his social media followers, summed it up with a personal comparison. “It’s like Antarctica is in recovery. I know a thing or two about that,” he said. “A low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.” After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock. The naked Antarctic will never be a tourist draw, but it is a powerful reminder that underneath the Earth’s fragile outer layer of water, ice, earth and vegetation, this is just another rock hurtling through space.Of all the moments during the trip, one stands out – an encounter in Paradise Harbour that stirred two rare feelings in the age of the Anthropocene: pure unmitigated joy and a nascent sense of hope.I heard the humpback before I saw it. A ripple, a sigh, then a soft splash behind my back. I turned in time to see the dorsal fin arc languorously out and back into the water just like a fairytale sketch of a sea serpent. The whale was about 30 metres away, and coming towards us. We couldn’t move – the coxswain had cut the boat’s engine a few minutes earlier in preparation for a hydrophone recording. All we could do was look on, speechless, as the whale drew nearer, 15 metres now, snorting water once again from its blowhole, then slipping just far enough below the surface to be out of sight. It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates. Seconds later, with a flick of its knobbled pectoral fin, it was under the water again. Mouths agape, beaming rapturously, the five of us looked at each other to confirm we had not imagined what we had seen. I cannot remember sharing such joy. The experience felt almost holy. But it wasn’t over. We turned around, and there was the whale again, completing a full circle of the boat, before silently swimming back the way it had come.We returned to the ship on a high. We were too excited to capture the encounter with any great skill. Nobody had pushed the record switch on the hydrophone. The clip I filmed on my phone was partly obscured by other bodies. Never mind. The moment would linger long in the memory. By listening, we had seen so much.Jonathan Watts’s time on board the Arctic Sunrise was funded by Greenpeace"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224882.1586424235!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"easter weekend weather temperatures to reach 19 degrees on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTemperatures are expected to rise to 18 degrees on Thursday and 19 degrees on Friday, according to Met Éireann.

Speaking to Virgin Media, Mr Harris said he expects to be advised tomorrow to keep the significant restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus.“What’s highly likely tomorrow is that the National Public Health Emergency Team will recommend that we continue with the very strict restrictions. I expect that to be a period of weeks,” he said.Mr Harris also said, Ireland will have to move onto a “different terrain” after that.People have been asked to stay inside as much as possible, except for necessary journeys including exercise within 2 kilometres of their home, since March 28th. People over 70 were asked to stay inside “cocoon” for the period in order to curb the spread of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.” New powersOn Tuesday, gardaí have been given new powers to enforce rules designed to keep as many people at home as possible.Fears of rising public complacency about the virus were echoed by gardaí who are monitoring more than 1,000 locations in the State including forest walks and beaches in the run-up to the Easter holidays to ensure compliance.Garda Deputy Commissioner John Twomey said gardaí had noticed that people were “beginning to get tired” of the social-distancing regulations.The regulations are based on the guidelines issued by the Government two weeks ago. Anyone exercising more than 2km from their home or with people from outside their household will be in breach. Anyone travelling beyond 2km for non-essential reasons will also be in breach.An offence will only be committed if a person refuses a direction from a garda to comply with the regulations. It is not the breaching of the regulations that is illegal, it is the disobeying of the Garda’s instructions once you are caught.The State’s health emergency team on Wednesday said a further 25 people had died from the virus – the second-highest number of deaths in the daily announcement. The deaths of 15 men and 10 women, whose median age was 80, brought the death toll to 235.There were 365 new cases of the disease confirmed on Wednesday, bringing total cases past the 6,000 mark for the first time, to 6,074 known cases in the Republic.Medics have raised concerns about a possible surge in patients later this month if members of the public did not adhere to social-distancing requirements over the Easter weekend.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4225362.1586464467!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 clusters now in 100 nursing homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNursing homes now account for a third of the clusters of infection across the country. File photograph: John StillwellPA WireThe number of coronavirus infection clusters in nursing homes around the country has reached 100, according to the latest detailed figures on coronavirus cases released by State officials.The State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre disclosed more detailed information showing that as of Monday, April 6th, there were outbreaks – defined as two or more cases – in 100 nursing homes, including 52 in the east of the country, 20 in the northeast and 13 in the west.There were four clusters in nursing homes in the midlands, another four in the midwest, three in the northwest, three in the south and one in the southeast.There were a further 37 clusters in residential facilities, of which 22 were in Dublin.InfectionNursing homes now account for a third of the clusters of infection across the country, followed by hospitals on 16 per cent with 48 clusters.“I would still be confident of the ability of the sector to be able to deal with these clusters with the right support from Government,” said Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative body for the sector.Reaching the 100-mark in a sector with 440 private nursing homes and 120 HSE-run public homes “reinforces the requirement for the Government to fulfil the commitments on a consistent basis across the country” when it comes to provide support and protection equipment, he said.Mr Daly said that the HSE had provided support to inidual nursing homes struggling to manage outbreaks where staff levels have fallen due to employees having to stay at home to self-isolate due to exposure to the illness.“This should be replicated for other nursing homes that have been particularly badly hit,” he said.The HSE said it would continue to work with homes to support them in caring for residents and “work with them through the critical stage of outbreaks in their centres as is required”.In updated guidance published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the HSE has told residential care facilities that the transfer of Covid-19 patients to acute hospitals “should be limited to situations in which it is necessary to provide essential care to residents”.A survey by NHI of nursing homes found that 178 nursing homes had lost more than 700 healthcare assistants, while more than 110 had lost close to 300 nurses.ConsiderationNorthern Ireland public health specialist Dr Gabriel Scally said that consideration must be made for nursing home staff who are largely foreign nationals and work in a variety of places, not just one home have two or three jobs, or are providing care in the community through an agency.The Government had to ensure that “if someone doesn’t have good living conditions they can be put into isolation in a hotel to make it easy for people to try and avoid the virus as much as possible,” said Dr Scally.Health officials have established a special facility at Citywest hotel in west Dublin for Covid-19-positive people or those suspected of having the disease who were not able to self-isolate at home.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Senior officials working

Photograph: ReutersOn a day another 28 people died from coronavirus, modelling data shows that the disease’s daily advance has reduced from 33 per cent in the early stages of the outbreak to 9 per cent this week.Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team’s epidemiological modelling group, said the virus would have “overwhelmed” the country by now only for public-health restrictions.“What would have happened in those circumstance is that within 20 days from now we would have had a peak of 100,000 cases per day,” he said.If measures had been limited to initial restrictions to close schools, universities, and curtail public gatherings, the country would have encountered an “overwhelming peak of infection at 60,000 cases,” said Prof Nolan.“This is not a simple question of flattening the curve, it’s not simply a question of pushing the peak out into the future, it’s a question of completely suppressing this disease,” he added.The rate at which the virus is being passed has reduced significantly, he said. Where one case would infect another 4½ people at the beginning of the outbreak, that reproduction multiple had fallen to about one extra person, he added.However, the virus would continue to spread slowly through the population if that reproduction rate was “even a fraction above one”, said Prof Nolan.Physical distancing and curtailment on non-essential movement would likely be needed “for some prolonged period of time in order to keep the disease suppressed”. And any decision to ease or lift the measures would be “risky” he said.In addition to the further fatalites on Thursday the number of confirmed cases in the State increased by 500. This represents the largest jump in a single day to date.Fifteen of the patients who died were female and 13 were male. The average age was 84, according to the public health emergency team. Nineteen of the patients had an underlying health condition.This brings the number of deaths from the coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, to 263 in the Republic.The number of known cases increased to 6,574 on Thursday. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan attributed the spike in confirmed cases to increased testing.Dr Holohan also said he was “sensitive” to uncertainty facing Leaving Ceificate students regarding the State examinations and. Officials “will try to bring as much certainty to that as quickly as we can”, he added.Travel into the country from the UK and further abroad was “very very limited” to returning Irish citizens and essential workers, such as haulage drivers working in key supply chains, said Dr Holohan.HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henrysaid the health service’s position on the use of face masks had not changed, and only iniduals advised to wear masks should use the protective equipment.There was evidence that widespread general use of masks “may add to your risk”, said Dr Henry. This is because people who do not know how to correctly use the equipment may end up touching their face more as a result, he said.Nursing homesThe number of coronavirus infection clusters in nursing homes countrywide has reached 100, according to the latest detailed figures on coronavirus cases released by State officials.The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC) disclosed more detailed information showing that as of Monday, April 6th, there were outbreaks – defined as two or more cases – in 100 nursing homes, including 52 in the east of the country, 20 in the northeast and 13 in the west.There were four clusters in nursing homes in the midlands, another four in the midwest, three in the northwest, three in the south and one in the southeast.There were a further 37 clusters in residential facilities, of which 22 were in Dublin.Fianna Fáil on testingMeanwhile, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said that more than 50,000 people are waiting to be tested.He said that in terms of testing, “around 53,000 tests have been completed to date. There were 51,000 people awaiting appointments for swab-taking and it seems to me that there is still a degree of work to be done on the testing front. What was identified to us was a lab-capacity issue. So, suffice to say, the country is not where it would want to be in terms of the volume of testing and the turnaround of testing.”As the Easter bank holiday approaches Cross-Border travel will be monitored by gardaí and PSNI officers to ensure people are adhering to coronavirus restrictions.Infectious disease expert Dr Paddy Mallon said the Irish Government acted at the right time, unlike in the United Kingdom where an event such as Cheltenham was allowed proceed. Consequently, there are now “tens of thousands” of cases.It was “one of the seminal” events that led to wider spread of the virus in the UK, Dr Mallon told Newstalk Breakfast.The weekend could be “Ireland’s Cheltenham” if people in the east of the country (where there are more cases) “decide to take off”, he warned.Deaths in Northern IrelandDr Mallon’s warning comes as the number of people who have died from the virus in Northern Ireland has risen by four to 82, according to the latest figures from the North’s Public Health Agency, released on Thursday afternoon.The agency also said there were 138 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number in the North to 1,477. A total of 10,203 people have been tested for the virus.In the Republic gardaí have been given new powers to enforce rules designed to keep as many people at home as possible. Local authorities countrywide have also announced that beach car parks will be closed over the weekend. County councils including Cork, Wexford, Mayo and Clare have published details of closures on social media.At the Government’s morning Covid-19 briefing, assistant secretary general in the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan said “points of contact have been established to monitor cross-Border travel and . . . gardaí will follow their usual approach to engage, educate, encourage and enforce as a last resort”.Analysis by the HSPC of 6,444 cases shows the median age is 48.

She died at her home on Wednesday after having suffered from cancer.Born in 1952, she had also been a member of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired the Roscommon Child Abuse Inquiry and co-chaired the Independent Child Death Review group.The President said Ms Gibbons was “an inspirational figure and a powerful voice” who championed the advancement of children’s rights in Ireland.“Driven by a profound sense of social justice and empathy, Norah Gibbons has left an enormous legacy, not only for the children of Ireland but for all those who cherish the values of equality that underpin our republic and democracy,” he said.“Sabina and I express our deepest condolences to her family, friends and former colleagues.”Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan described her as “an exceptional woman who brought her innate judgement, common sense and humanity to everything she did”.“She leaves behind a tremendous legacy, in particular for the children of Ireland,” he said.“During her final illness, Norah continued to work to help others, through her leadership of the independent study on familicide and domestic homicide. It was typical of her resolute sense of purpose that, in recent weeks, she was keen to ensure that this important work would be completed and I was glad to be able to give her that assurance.“All through her life, she was a passionate and tireless advocate for children and others in vulnerable situations.”‘Indefatigable’Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone said Ms Gibbons was “passionate and indefatigable” in her service to children and the State.“I worked closely with her when she chaired Tusla and I admired her determination and focus on establishing our first dedicated agency for children and families,” she said.“Her establishment and leadership of Tusla placed children and families at the centre of Irish law, policy and public service.”In a statement, Tusla said Ms Gibbons was “a tireless advocate for the rights of children, who inspired so many around her”.“Today we remember Norah Gibbons for her long and outstanding contribution to public life on many important issues, including tirelessly advocating for vulnerable children, young people and the most vulnerable in our society,” Tusla’s chief executive Bernard Gloster said.Suzanne Connolly, chief executive of Barnardos, said Ms Gibbons joined Barnardos during the 1990s as a social worker before serving as director of advocacy for the children’s charity.“Her energy, commitment and passion for the rights of children in Ireland changed many children’s lives for the better, and she will be remembered by many,” Ms Connolly said.Ms Gibbons also served as both a director and chair of Alcohol Action Ireland. The organisation said “her outstanding contribution to Irish public life, her passion to tackle inequality and commitment to improving the lives of so many will be long remembered”.Women’s Aid Ireland described Ms Gibbons as “an inspiring woman, so dedicated to social justice and the care, protection and prevention of cruelty toward the most vulnerable”.Ms Gibbons is survived by her husband Seán, son Miles and daughter Maireas.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4225539.1586474659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government to extend restrictions for at least two weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFr Malachy Conlon brings the Blessed Sacrament to parishioners in Co Louth while churches close and services are cancelled. Photograph: Peter LarkinCiara WilkinsonThe Government will on Friday announce an extension of the Covid-19 restrictions on commercial and social life, but is expected to indicate that a partial lifting of the strict regime could take place next month if the rate of infections continues to fall.The restrictions are to stay in place for at least the next two weeks, with several senior sources expecting that they will remain until the May bank holiday weekend.The move is likely to be announced on Friday afternoon after a meeting of senior public health officials. Minister for Health Simon Harris is then expected to sign an extension of the Garda powers to enforce the lockdown.While the focus remains on maintaining the restrictions of recent weeks in order to continue the suppression of the virus, senior officials have begun to work on plans for a “phased” exit from the lockdown.However, senior sources stress that even when the easing of the restrictions comes, it will only be partial and gradual.Priorities are expected to include reopening some retail businesses, construction and schools – possibly for only part of the week initially.There was a heavy Garda presence on many routes on Thursday as gardaí sought to enforce restrictions. As the Easter holiday approaches, cross-Border travel will be monitored by gardaí and PSNI officers to ensure people are adhering to coronavirus restrictions.People caught by gardaí engaging in unnecessary travel this weekend will be given at least three opportunities to comply with the law before facing arrest, according to a direction from Garda management.Before resorting to arrest, gardaí must go through the four-step escalation process termed “engage, explain, encourage, enforce”, Garda superintendents have been advised.Under the emergency legislation anyone travelling for non-essential reasons or exercising farther than 2km from home will be committing an offence.Phased wayAssistant secretary general at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan said on Thursday that work was under way to determine what any lifting of restrictions would look like.“I suppose at the beginning we might have all thought that would happen in one go, but we’re more clear now it’s going to happen in a much more phased way. So there’s ongoing work, and there are a number of subgroups looking at a range of issues,” she said.However, Ministers and senior officials were at pains to stress that any relaxation of the restrictions was weeks away and entirely contingent on uncertain factors – not just further reductions in the infection rate but a significant increase in testing and tracing capacityIt was announced on Thursday evening that 28 more people had died from the coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities in the State to 263.Fifteen of the patients who died were female, and 13 were male, with a median age of 84, according to the National Public Health Emergency Team. Nineteen of the patients had an underlying health condition. Some 22 of the deaths were located in the east, two in the northwest, two in the south and two in the west.The number of confirmed cases in the State increased by 500, the highest increase in a single day to date and now stands at 6,574.Analysis by the Health Surveillance Protection Centre (HSPC) of 6,444 cases as of Tuesday shows the median age of known cases is 48.Although the number of known cases rose sharply on Thursday, data compiled for the Department of Health shows the rate of growth is beginning to slow. While new cases were growing at a rate of 33 per cent at the beginning of the outbreak, that has slowed to 9 per cent this week.In addition, there has been a significant decline in the infection rate – the number of infections caused by people infected with the virus.At the beginning of the outbreak each case was responsible for 4.5 infections this had now been reduced to about one person, said Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team’s epidemiological modelling group.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said he was “sensitive” to uncertainty facing Leaving Cert students regarding the State examinations, and officials “will try to bring as much certainty to that as quickly as we can”.Dr Holohan added that travel into the country from the UK and further abroad was “very very limited” to returning Irish citizens and essential workers, such as haulage drivers working in key supply chains.MasksThe HSE’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry, said the health service’s position on the use of face masks had not changed, and only iniduals advised to wear masks should use the protective equipment.Latest HSPC figures show that two more people between ages of 35 and 54 died earlier this week, bringing the death toll of coronavirus victims under 55 years of age to 12.Among the confirmed daily deaths announced on Monday, April 6th, was a person aged between 35 and 44 and a person aged between 45 and 54.Out of the total deaths of 223 reported on Monday, 200 people were aged 65 years and over 11 were aged between 55 and 64 seven were aged between 45 and 54 three were aged between 35 and 44 and two were aged between 25 and 34.Out of 5,981 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases, the 223 deaths gave a fatality rate of 3.7 per cent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224984.1586428448!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"when i look at the viral loads we find in elderly people it is mind boggling","story":"Virtual reality images taken from a coronavirus patient in a Washington DC hospital shows how the virus can invade the lungs and kill. Video: The New York Times\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Marc Van Ranst said the pandemic was exposing weaknesses in national healthcare systems.The Covid-19 virus is “incredibly aggressive and spectacularly contagious”, according to leading coronavirus scientists. Virus numbers are three times what might be found with other respiratory viruses such as flu, including in older patients, who are more contagious than expected.“These are the highest viral loads for any virus I know,” said Prof Marc Van Ranst at the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium. He said he was astonished at the number of the germs he saw from patient throat samples in his lab. Especially surprising, he said, was that elderly people harbour prodigious quantities of virus.When older people become infected with viruses like flu, they do not produce many virus particles, because their mucosal surfaces are older and drier, it was believed. “When I look at the viral loads that we find in elderly people, it is mind boggling,” he said. “That has been for me the big surprise with this virus.” This will influence how contagious elderly people can be and perhaps is reflected in the high number of Covid-19 clusters in nursing homes, Prof Van Ranst added. AbundantThe virus is abundant in the throat of younger patients too, according to viral counts reported in the science journal Nature this week. Nine young to middle-aged office workers near Munich, Germany, who showed mild flu-like symptoms, had their nose and throat swabbed daily and spit samples collected for viral counts. “We detected Sars-CoV-2 in enormous amounts in the upper respiratory tract,” said Prof Clemens Wendtner, who led the research in Germany – 1,000 times more than for Sars. “This was shocking news.” He is head of infectious diseases at a teaching hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich.All nine patients showed a high rate of viral replication and shedding in their throat during their first week of infection. The virus does not need to travel to the lungs to replicate, and is abundant in the throat, making it easy to pass on. “It can be spread easily by sneezing or coughing,” said Prof Wendtner. His hospital now has 190 Covid-19 patients and “there is no difference between the young and elderly” in viral load. There are three times more Covid-19 viruses on patient swabs compared to viruses such as influenza or RSV. Covid-19, said Prof Wendtner, “can be transmitted by elderly people in care home”. He advises “face and mouth protection for the entire population, regardless of age”, which is being considered in Germany.“The viral loads that people encounter when someone coughs in their general direction,” are so high, said Prof Van Ranst, that it makes transmission likely to happen. “Compared to other respiratory viruses, this is remarkable,” he added. It also meant it was easier for those with even mild symptoms to contaminate surfaces. The Nature paper confirms that “for the milder form of the disease, it doesn’t go as far as the lungs, but stays in the throat”, said immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill of Trinity College Dublin. “It means it is very transmissible just by talking. You don’t need to cough,” he said. Also, people without symptoms, “are very infectious,” he added. “Sars never infected the throat. Went straight to the lungs. So a that’s big difference,” he explained. Cell culture“For Sars-1,” said Prof Wendtner, “it was very difficult to put these viruses into cell culture. It is quite easy for Sars-CoV-2, due to the fact that we had high viral loads.” Some patients in Munich did not have fevers, yet some were super-spreaders. “It is not easy to identify Covid-19 patients,” he warned.Asked about the Nature study, TCD virologist Dr Kim Roberts noted infectious virus was readily recovered from the nine patients during the first week of symptoms, but not after day 8, though high amounts of viral RNA could be detected. “This could support the suggestion that people, at least with mild symptoms, are less infectious after the first week of symptoms.” Most of the patients developed antibodies against the virus around day 7 of symptoms, she added.Prof Van Ranst said the pandemic was exposing weaknesses in national healthcare systems. “In Belgium it is the elderly care homes. The quality is not good enough in terms of withstanding a medical crisis.” “In the Netherlands and the UK, it is the number of intensive care beds which is really problematic. In the US, it is the lack of universal healthcare that is the biggest problem,” he said. Ireland had a similar number of ICUs per person as the UK, and nursing homes here had been badly impacted by Covid-19 .

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

However, the ban on slaughtering and selling live animals remains in place.Scientists and Chinese officials believe the deadly virus  jumped to humans from wild animals, via creatures such as bats.Close contact with wild animals at the markets, which had been closed since January, has been widely blamed for the outbreak.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus entered new york europe not asia researchers find","story":"One study has found an early case of the virus in the city was in all likelihood indirectly transmitted by an inidual who brought it across from Britain.But while President Donald Trump barred foreign nations at the end of January from entering the US if they had been in China, it was not until mid-March that similar restrictions were placed on travellers from most European countries.Researchers suggest that by this point travellers had already been returning to New York with coronavirus from countries such as Italy.They found that the Long Island patient’s viral genome correlated with that of a strain circulating in Britain. That suggested the patient had contact with someone who had brought the virus over from the UK.Scientists at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital have written a study also indicating that coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that the travelers who brought in the virus did not arrive from Asia.Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn who co-wrote the study, which is awaiting peer review, told The New York Times: “The majority is clearly European.” Both teams examined genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers from mid-March.Their research appears to suggest that the previously hidden spread of the virus might have been detected earlier if more testing had been in place.China announced at the end of December that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a new respiratory illness.A few countries, such as Singapore, launched an aggressive testing program to identify the arrival of the virus and trace its spread through the population.But the US initially limited testing only to people who had come from China in the two weeks before January 31 and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.Dr Heguy said: “It was a disaster that we didn’t do testing. People were just oblivious.”One passenger, Pam Mundus, who returned home on a direct flight from Rome to JFK on March 1, said at the time that no one questioned her about her visit to Italy, or whether she might have been exposed to the virus. Early findings suggest that the virus was in New York well before a woman in her 30s from Manhattan became the city’s first official patient on March 1.Dr Viviana Simon, of the team, said in a statement that the results indicate that the coronavirus “came to New York City and environs predominantly via untracked transmission between the United States and Europe, with only limited introduction from China, where the virus originated.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus next 100 days future uk economy health","story":"On new year\u0027s eve last year the first case of Covid-19 was reported to the WHO. As of today, Thursday 9 April 2020, we are one hundred days in to living with the virus.We asked our expert journalists to look ahead and forecast what the next 100 days will hold. What is the outlook for their sector? Which key questions must be answered? And what will their world look like 100 days from now, on Saturday 18 July? The areas covered are as follows: The UK, the world, science, politics, the NHS, lockdown and social distancing, the economy, small and medium businesses, personal finance, property, sport, the arts, environment, education, mental health, physical health, travel and Brexit.These are their responses.If the first 100 days of this pandemic have been characterised by collective shock, denial and now frustration, we should expect the next three months to be marked by our adaptability. It’s what pychologists call the Kübler-Ross model, or the “five stages of grief”, and is a useful way of thinking about what the coronavirus holds for us over the weeks and months ahead. The model is usually shown as a bowl-shaped curve with the “shock” on the high left, a steep descent into depression and then a slow but steady rise to a new normal.The upward slope of the curve may have been what The Queen had in mind when she told the nation on Sunday: While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. We join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us”.The shock of the past 100 days has been brutal, but the green shoots of recovery are becoming evident. The way we came together to demand a lockdown in order to protect the most vulnerable among us is testament not just to our humanity but our good sense. Darwinian forces may have shaped us but we see ourselves as a society not a herd. You see it too in the millions of small chores and errands people all over the country are running for those less able than themselves.Scientists from all disciplines have also grown in stature and confidence. They are displacing ideology with evidence and knee jerk reaction with reasoned decision making. They are also embracing cross-border cooperation and transparency like never before. One of the first papers providing hard evidence that infection with the coronavirus creates protective antibodies in our blood was published yesterday by a team of Chinese scientists and shared instantly around the world. In the same vein, the once secretive scientific committees advising ministers in Britain have taken to publishing, not just the abbreviated minutes of their meetings, but the substance too in order that others can constantly test and critique their decision making.Even the public are becoming involved. Perhaps the best view we have of the spread of the coronavirus in Britain is provided by data from the Covid Symptom Tracker app, used by over two million ordinary Brits. The latest figures estimate that 1.4 million people in the UK aged 20-69 have symptomatic Covid-19, a fall from 1.9 million on the 1 April.While scientists are working round the clock on treatments and vaccines, thousands of other experts are collaborating on the economics and logistics of getting our factories, schools and high streets up and running again.Don’t expect lockdown to end within the next 100 days but we will almost certainly know the shape of it by then.Life is unlikely to fully return to normal until a vaccine or treatment is found but with good planning and direction from the top, it should be possible for large parts of society to be at least partially freed-up without the virus spiking dangerously again and overwhelming the NHS..If there is a risk in front of us, and there surely is, it comes less from the virus itself but the profound economic and political shock which the world will experience in its wake. We know from history that such shocks like this can spark conflict and already China and the US are squaring up to each other, stoking palpable fear and tensions.Covid-19 has exposed the world’s frailties and its strengths: we humans have a long established habit of messing up before dusting ourselves down and starting over again. Be in no doubt, we will get back on our feet. The only real variable is how many people will die unnecessarily in the process.There are really only three kinds of country in the world today: those slowly waking from the coronavirus nightmare those in the middle of it and those who are about to be hit.All face the same brutal dilemma: how to balance human lives and public health with economic sustainability.Over the next few weeks each will see their latent weaknesses, and perhaps strengths, exposed in unforgiving light. And the outcomes will vary dramatically according to national wealth.China, South Korea, and Japan, the advanced economies which suffered the first wave of the coronavirus crisis, will try to ease their city lockdowns without allowing a resurgence of the virus.But early signs are that it will be a tricky and long-drawn out process. Tellingly China has still not rescheduled the annual meeting of the National People\u0027s Congress, which was postponed in March, suggesting Beijing is not quite confident that progress is irreversible.Meanwhile, developed countries in Europe and North America where the epidemic has yet to peak will remain focussed on saving lives. Lockdowns may be extended into the early summer, and tensions over the economic, social, and political consequences will rise.The mounting death rate in the United States in particular poses an immense challenge to president Donald Trump in the run-up to November\u0027s presidential election, and could challenge orthodoxies around healthcare.Everywhere, the global economic slowdown will have knock-on effects with as yet impossible to predict consequences.The Kremlin\u0027s spokesman warned Russians last weekend to be braced for a perfect storm economic crisis lasting up to two years.  But alarmingly, a third wave hitting the developing world is only now taking off.With neither the healthcare capacity to handle multiple cases nor the economic reserves to survive the shutdowns that saved lives in Europe and East Asia, the outbreaks are likely to last longer and claim many more lives.Aid agencies are especially worried about conflict zones like Libya, where an outbreak of the virus has failed to slow the fighting, and refugee camps, where cramped conditions and rudimentary sanitation mean thousands of people will likely die if the virus takes hold.  In the world\u0027s largest refugee camps in Cox\u0027s Bazaar, Bangladesh, there is not a single venilator for more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a genocide in Myanmar in 2017. Médicines sans Frontier have described the camps, which are overcrowded and unsanitary as a ticking time bomb.The first 100 days of the coronavirus have brought the economy to a ‘hard stop’ the likes of which has never been seen before.Preventative action to stop the spread of the pandemic has forced the shutdown of swathes of British and global productive capacity.The next 100 days begins with a reckoning in the jobs market. Economists expect GDP to fall by as much as 20 per cent by the end of April.JP Morgan estimates such a fall would be expected to push up unemployment from below 4 per cent at the start of the year to as much as 13 per cent - far worse than the financial crisis or the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.Almost 1m have signed up for benefits already. Typically that would cause serious scarring as some of the unemployed lose touch with the world of work for years, finding it hard to get a job and seeing their skills lose value as they are not kept up to date with modern employment.If the furlough schemes and business support efforts work the unemployment rate could be limited to around 7 per cent, staving off the worst social and economic effects of the crunch.The next key factor is the length of the shutdown. If restrictions begin to be eased in May, a rapid bounceback seems possible. Retail and hospitality can begin to reopen, bit by bit.Domestic travel can recommence. Workers on furlough or working from home can get back to normal work. Government efforts to ‘bridge’ this period with grants, loans and wage payments will have largely succeeded in keeping the economy from collapse.“We expect the economy to rebound quite swiftly, should quarantine measures be lifted sometime before the third quarter,” says economist Sanjay Raja at Deutsche Bank.This would not restore the economy to its previous peak instantly. International travel and large-scale events will take longer to return to normal. Lost education, training and investment could also take time to be recovered.Behaviours could change, too. Businesses and households may build up more savings to keep themselves safe from any ‘second wave’ or other future lockdown. That is the good scenario.But if the shutdown carries on into June or even to the end of the next 100 days, the economy could look very different.More businesses and jobs will have been lost for good. Those who are still standing risk lower incomes or higher debts. Businesses will be less willing to fund new investment in a weaker economy, and workers risk losing their skills after a prolonged period of forced rest.In that case, a long depression could lie ahead.In early January the World Health Organization issued an alert warning that a “pneumonia of unknown cause” had been identified in Wuhan, China. Just a few days later the mystery illness was confirmed to be a novel coronavirus and within a week Chinese scientists had published its full genetic sequence. Since then, experts across the globe have been scrambling to uncover the virus’ secrets. While miracles will not happen overnight, never before have scientists been so united in a common pursuit – and already a remarkable amount of progress has been made. “There is this spirit of collaboration,” Nick Cammack, therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust, told The . “Science is the exit strategy.” Looking forward, there are three key areas that experts are honing in on. The first is to answer the outstanding unknowns: How many of us have already had the virus? How common are asymptomatic carriers? And how much immunity, if any, do we acquire after surviving an infection?Widespread antibody testing will unlock many of these answers, as accurate assays will be able to detect prior infections and identify whether we are approaching widespread immunity. Scientists at the UK’s high tech, high security facility at Porton Down near Salisbury are among those who have already started this work – expect answers in the near future. Identifying effective treatments is another essential area of focus. While experts have started to track down completely new compounds that could be used to attack the coronavirus in the future, the most promising option right now is to repurpose existing drugs.Antimalarial treatments first tested during the Second World War (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), a combination drug used to treat HIV patients (ritonavir and lopinavir) and an antiviral first developed to treat Ebola (remdesivir) have all been pitted as potential cures, alongside convalescent plasma therapy and anti-inflammatories.While hundreds of clinical trials have started during the pandemic, it is the “megatrials” launched by the WHO, University of Oxford and French firm Inserm that will offer the most conclusive results as they have the largest sample sizes. Initial results for some of the potential therapies could start to emerge within a month. The final, and perhaps most critical, tool is a vaccine. About 35 companies and academic institutes are racing to create an inoculation and four candidates have already been tested in animals – but experts have warned it will be at least a year, if not 18 months, until a safe vaccine is ready for widespread use. Efforts are under way to speed this process up. Bill Gates announced this week that he would build factories to manufacture the seven most promising vaccines – even though this would “waste” billions of dollars, as the Gates Foundation would only ever mass produce two candidates. It’s a sign, if you needed one, of just how seriously the international community is taking the coronavirus threat. “Science is the exit strategy” might be a savvy soundbite, but it’s also true. The NHS has worked at full throttle to plan for the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, creating 10,000 extra intensive care beds at NHS Nightingale Hospitals and asking tens of thousands of retired medics and students to join the fight. Consultant surgeons have retrained as ICU nurses, as operating theatres and labour wards have been converted into Covid-19 wards.  When the peak comes in the next 10 to 20 days, with London and the West Midlands expected to come first, we will see if the preparations were sufficient.Staffing will be a major pinch point. A workforce deficit of 100,000 before the crisis will be compounded by medics going off sick - up to 25 per cent of staff are already self-isolating, according to the highest estimates. Increased testing will help, but medics will need to adapt.Nurses in ICU, who normally look after one patient at a time, could be asked to monitor half a dozen at once, while doctors will improvise with anaesthetic machines when ventilators are all in use and move patients around the hospital to maintain oxygen pressure. After insufficient amounts of PPE equipment were delivered in the early days of the crisis, fixes to the supply chain should hold up.As hospitals reach capacity, ambulances will be re-routed to NHS Nightingale Hospitals. NHS Providers has early confidence that hospitals won’t become overwhelmed, as they were in Italy, but is concerned about the effect on community services, such as GPs and social care. Frontline charities, such as St John\u0027s Ambulance, will need to draw on new funding from the Government in order to support the NHS.Coronavirus deaths will be commonplace, and medics will find themselves standing in for loved ones. They will facilitate video calls with family members, play comforting music, and hold patients\u0027 hands as they take their last breath. Medics will also die. There could also be a rise in non-corona deaths, as patients avoid going to A\u0026ampE and miss out on treatment.After the peak hospital admissions will plateau, but it will take weeks for the effect to be seen on wards as critical patients recover. Lockdown measures will help avoid a second peak, while contact tracing and immunity testing will become key.“People are putting on brave faces when in fact they are crying inside,” one ICU doctor tells me. NHS staff will rely upon a new NHS mental health helpline and ‘wobble rooms’ to ease the burden, but some will suffer from PTSD. Without a doubt, though, they will continue to work as hard as they can.As Dr Qian Xu, an A\u0026ampE doctor, says, “We are all scared, just like everyone else, but we have a professional duty to fight this war.The lockdown has obviously pushed us further apart. We can\u0027t see loved ones we can\u0027t go to work the public sphere, famously described by Jurgen Habermas as the place where ideas and experiences are freely exchanged, is gone. Even if we do go for a walk, we have to keep two metres apart, and our faces are hidden behind masks. This is deeply ironic given how much time Europe spent debating whether or not women should wear the Burqa.On the other hand, this is the closest we\u0027ve come to a collective experience in years. We are suddenly watching the same news and digesting the same information. We\u0027re probably talking to each other more than ever over phone and internet, and hundreds of thousands have volunteered to help the NHS. There is evident national pride at the construction of NHS Nightingale, the largest critical unit in the world, in just nine days.Criticism of politicians and suspicion that we might be getting this wrong, is balanced by the feeling that we\u0027re all in this together, even if all we can do is shout hello from a safe distance.But these are early days. Lockdown Britain is going to have to process two traumas. First, death. People die all the time, but rarely in one go and with the same condition, and never with this degree of media attention. Given the scale of mortality it\u0027s likely that almost every family will be touched by it but, due to the lockdown, we\u0027ll be denied many of the usual rites and companionship that we rely upon to cope with grief.Second, we are going to have to confront the trauma of prolonged boredom, unemployment and loneliness. There\u0027s been growing awareness in recent years of the link between mental and physical health, that if you are depressed or unstimulated, physical problems follow. Well, now we are engaged in a mass experiment in enforced isolation or, just as difficult, being stuck with the same person for a long period of time. One suspects that as frustrations increase, so will tensions between the generations.The phrase things will never be the same again is almost as over-familiar as stay at home - but it\u0027s not necessarily true.Some things will go straight back to normal when the lockdown ends because we miss them and we want them back: the pubs will be jam-packed and flights will sell out. But the Coronavirus could always return for another season, or some other disease, so we are likely to be left feeling very vulnerable for a long time.Sport’s shutdown narrowly allowed the real Cheltenham Gold Cup and has just given us the Virtual Grand National. In between, the industry’s business model has been exposed as over-reliant on TV deals and reckless with its salaries for players.Pent-up longing will bring fans swarming back into stadiums. Britain’s love for sport was always deep but now we will see new heights of appreciation. But football, in particular, has stretched the public’s loyalty, with billionaire-owned Premier League clubs using the government’s furlough system to transfer staff wage costs to taxpayers. The cries of poverty emanating from many clubs and sports organisations have invited scrutiny around how they are run and where all the money goes.With Euro 2020, the Olympics, Wimbledon and The Open lost or postponed, the English sporting summer, a mainstay of our culture, has been wiped out. Another hundred days from now, in mid-July, cricket’s new smash-ball form, The Hundred, teeters as August and September become the best hopes for a resumption. The Hundred was meant to be cricket’s new goldmine but may not be seen until 2021.Football’s quandary is the most pressing. It hopes to complete the 2019-20 season before the next one can commence in August - or later - in large part to avoid paying rebates to broadcasters for uncompleted fixtures. Last season in the Premier League, Liverpool amassed 97 points but still fell short of the title, which they have not won for 30 years. This time they are 25 points clear with nine games left but are at the mercy of a microbe.Industry watchers predict a “bloodbath” as budgets are slashed and jobs cut. Sport’s complacent belief that the show would always go on has unravelled in the face of a pandemic - and even superstars have lost their omnipotence. Many will be feeling physically and mentally frazzled and will need time to regain their form.A country in need of life-affirming spectacles is desperate to see them back from their lockdowns. Yet the financial damage will take many years to correct. A return to the old ways of funnelling vast revenues to the performers and their agents with no structural underpinnings would show that lessons had not been learned.Hopes remain for live sport in July, or perhaps more realistically, August, but mass gatherings will be the last of the prohibitions eased by the government, so we may see sport proceed at first with turnstiles locked.One hundred days ago, Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party were still basking in the glory of an unexpectedly large election triumph. That victory came from a transformation of the party. A new Tory coalition was forged from disillusioned Labour voters in the Midlands, the North and Wales through a politics that was more Left-wing when it came to splashing the cash, but more Right-wing on key social issues such as immigration.Nowhere was the transformation more clear than at the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s Budget, where he opened the spending taps for tens of billions on roads, rail and broadband.Yet that Budget also marked a turning point. Mr Sunak announced £60 billion of spending to battle the economic fallout of the Coronavirus pandemic. Within days he was announcing billions of pounds more. And more again a few days after that. By then, all other priorities were on hold.As for the next 100 days, several major questions hang over the Government. The most obvious and immediate is how and when to lift the lockdown. Ministers and their scientific advisers are juggling a number of factors. They know that collapsed businesses and raging unemployment could lead to health problems just as damaging as the epidemic itself. But move too soon, overwhelm the NHS and see death rates from any and all illnesses and accidents spike, and the economy would be in dire straits anyway.When it ends, the epidemic will have complicated significantly the long-term goals of the Tory Party. The pandemic creates serious problems for “levelling-up”. The cost of supporting the economy through the lockdown will have piled tens of billions onto the national debt. How much room will be left for infrastructure? And will the global economy be stalling or roaring back? That matters for the public finances, but also for the regions that the Tories want to boost. Regenerating post-industrial towns is hard enough without a global recession.But is there a case for optimism? The economic recovery, which many still hope will be swift and dramatic, could provide a significant chance to reorder the economy. The Government has a major task ahead in reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, but it could target the post-virus stimulus not only at lifting up the regions but at transforming public transport, energy production and housing in the process. Here’s hoping.As this lockdown continues, one thing has become apparent to most families in Britain: we need teachers.  On March 20, schools across the UK shut indefinitely to all but the children of key workers in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. In an unprecedented move, GCSE and A-level exams will not take place instead, GCSEs, AS and A-levels will be awarded in July based on mock data, inidual assessment and prior attainment. Many have questioned the accuracy of these, particularly for black and minority ethnic, working-class and other marginalised students. Students may also be allowed to sit exams early in the next academic year or in summer 2021.The next three and a half months will bring us up to the end of summer term. The Government has said it will assess the situation after Easter, but most educators in Britain are preparing for the likelihood that schools will remain closed through May and, most likely, through the end of the summer term. While a study released this week by University College London concluded that closing schools may not have a big impact on preventing the spread of Covid-19, most around the world remain shut.What does this mean for learning? On one hand, the British education system is sensibly repetitive. “Homes aren’t schools, and nor should they be,” notes Dr Dan O’Hare, an educational psychologist at the University of Bristol. “They worry is that children need a lot of ‘learning’ - but the curriculum is pretty repetitive and they’ll have covered it before, and will cover it again.”The greater loss during this period is social, says Dr O’Hare. Whether four or 14, children rely on classroom interactions to build and maintain the social skills that will carry them through life. Adolescent development relies on peer identity. To keep that skillset going, Dr O’Hare says social media, with parental supervision, can be a very positive tool.The provision of education at home during this period is deeply uneven, and the degree to which parents are able to lead home-learning has exposed deep isions: while some parents may be organising four hours of focused, supported study each day, others in the same school may be struggling to feed their children.Some educators have taken the cancellation of exams this year as a chance to reconsider the British education system. The UK is alone in Europe in assessing twice (at 16 and 18), and in offering such a narrow range of subjects at the final school assessment level (A-level). Even the inventor of the GCSE has called for them to be scrapped perhaps this period of reflection will allow educators to step back and re-prioritise the outcomes of our education system?Twelve years ago – the last time the global economy was brought to its knees – it was the banks that needed bailing out. This time it’s everyone else: borrowers, savers, renters, homeowners – and yes, even landlords.Politicians and regulators have made it very clear that Britain’s banking system must now repay its debt and support the taxpayers who, as a result of the 2008 crisis, endured austerity and a lost decade of wage growth while property prices took ownership out of the reach of many younger workers.Banks have fallen into line, agreeing various “holidays”, from mortgage payments to extortionate overdraft fees. It seems certain these will now be extended into the next 100 days.I’m afraid the real economic hit will not be fully revealed for some time yet. Currently furloughed workers are having 80 per cent of their wages (up to £2,500 a month) guaranteed by the Government. A much-needed safety net, but one that doesn’t do much to help employers who must stump up the cash today, and claim it back later. At best, this is keeping thousands of firms on life support. When that is withdrawn, we will see unemployment figures soar, in line with the truly terrifying figures coming out of America. It will be far, far worse than the financial crisis.If that does come to pass, payment holidays of all stripes will need to be extended – there’s no chance of unemployed people being able to meet repayments. Applications for Universal Credit, the main out of work and low-income benefit payment, have already surged. Expect another wave in June. Universal Credit has already been increased, to just under £100 a week, and may need to be raised again.Most at risk is Britain’s five million-strong self-employed army. While Rishi Sunak did (eventually) extend his bailout to people who work for themselves, millions are still missing out on any help whatsoever. By mid-summer, what little cash reserves the prudent have set aside may have been burnt through, and struggling businesses will have cut contractors and other third parties to control costs. Mr Sunak has all but confirmed the self-employed will have to pay him back with higher National Insurance costs in the future. Though he may be forced to backtrack, as former chancellor Phillip Hammond was, given this could be seen as a “tax on entrepreneurs”.The self-employed and anyone who fills out a tax return have had a reprieve on this year’s “payments on account”. This second tax deadline will now be due in January 2021, not July this year. More help may be forthcoming when the scale of the challenge facing the sector becomes apparent.  Students and parents of children at nurseries and fee-paying schools face a nervous wait. Will they get any refunds? So far, institutions are resisting particularly where they are offering online services. If the lockdown is still in place in 100 days they may be forced to offer refunds, even if that means they enter dire financial straits.Anyone with a big chunk of their assets in the stock market will be hurting – a lot. The FTSE 100 index of the biggest British companies has lost about a third of its value since the start of the year. Billions of idends have been cut, and will likely not resurface for years. Yet there is a growing case for arguing this is one of the best times in history to be investing. In three months’ time, brand-new investors or people putting their cash into markets now, might already be sitting on healthy profits. Pick the right stocks and in 20 years’ time, well you might just be a surprise entry to the ranks of Isa millionaires.A screenwriter I know claims he has never been so busy  – the film industry has in the last fortnight gone into overdrive, he says, looking for material to fill the gaps that will occur when the lockdown lifts, with every studio determined to be ahead of the game.The same is true throughout the arts. Having rolled out programmes of streamed content to ensure some continuity, the movers and shakers have knuckled down to the conference-call business of forward planning for the autumn and beyond.Not much is likely to happen before September. Glyndebourne still fondly hopes to reopen on 14 July, and at the time of writing the BBC Proms (theoretically kicking off on 17 July) hasn’t yet been canned. But the Edinburgh festival jamboree in August is off, and West End shows aren’t likely to reopen in a hurry when there will be scant traffic, either touristic or domestic.So the focus is now on shifting dates and contracts to counter the loss of short-term income and minimise unnecessary risks: expect the announcement of some extra-long panto runs, and a lot of performances of tried and tested hits such as Carmen, Swan Lake and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ENO is replacing its autumn Coliseum season with 10 weeks of the musical Hairspray.The good news is that the Chancellor has been quick to recognise the sector’s needs and decent concessions have been made, even if the sums involved are hardly on the German scale of 50 billion euros. Gift Aid can now be claimed on tickets not refunded, and Arts Council England has relaxed National Lottery rules so that money that would otherwise have channeled to capital projects can be used for emergency aid to the arts instead, without cost to the Treasury or the taxpayer. Some extra grant will be necessary for museums not under the ACE umbrella – could its source lie in the £120 million currently allotted to the Brexit Festival of 2022?The biggest challenge facing the arts over the next 100 days is to predict how taste and demand will change as a result of the trauma of the crisis – quite apart from the effect that straitened incomes will have on people’s ability to pay for entertainment. But be in no doubt: the arts are highly resourceful, imaginative and upbeat - and they have an absolutely central role to play in the national recovery.In another world, Glasgow would be gearing up to host the international climate summit COP26 in July, the biggest moment for climate diplomacy since the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015.Its postponement until next year pauses desperately needed international cooperation to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.That might not be such a bad thing. You will be hard-pressed to find many observers who held out high hopes for the outcome of the summit.The talks will now take place in a changed world.What may turn out to be the greatest impact of the crisis is the overturning of many of the assumptions that underpin our consumption-based emissions. Do we need to fly to that conference, rather than join online? Can we all adjust to working from home more and limiting our car journeys?Meanwhile, it has reminded us of the value of the natural world. Suddenly, we are desperate for the restorative powers of the great outdoors, and the local wildlife has come out of hiding. The zoonotic origins of the disease may prompt a rethink about our relationship to wildlife and bioersity. China is under pressure to permanently ban wildlife markets, believed to be the source of the virus.Already we can see the benefit to the environment of our changed behaviour. Carbon emissions and air pollution have dipped during the shutdown China’s annual CO2 emissions are estimated to have fallen 18 per cent. Air travel is down more than half.Clearly, these cuts are unsustainable in the current mode and are likely to bounce back, as we have already seen in China, unless they are translated into long-term changes.Questions over how we will rebuild have rightly largely been put aside for the time being as the world focuses on saving lives and getting back to work. But in 100 days we will start to see more conversations about where we want to focus our resources and whether the post-Covid stimulus packages should be invested toward a greener world.The prospects for that are mixed, so far. The response in the US is likely to be decided in the November presidential election. Already Donald Trump has relaxed environmental requirements for the fossil fuel industry, citing the crisis.China has also relaxed some environmental regulations and early indicators suggest it has ramped up production in those areas of the country where the lockdown has eased.The EU has said it remains committed to its Green Deal, but there have been calls from Poland and the Czech Republic for it to be put on hold.The other big question for the next few weeks is what role will international cooperation play? Should we start to see a united front in the fight against this virus, it may reinforce the power of collaboration to face a common challenge. Again there, so far, the outlook is not rosy.For many, the anxiety set in slowly. As people washed their hands to the tune of Happy Birthday with one eye on the news, talk of mass death and draconian lockdowns started to fill our social media feeds. It sounded hysterical at first, but it wasn’t long before all our lives had changed beyond recognition. 100 days in, and our so-called “new normal” has left us with a mental health crisis which is gathering speed.It’s no surprise given how much has changed. We are now unable to see and touch our loved ones, even when they are dying. We don gloves and masks for the occasional nervous visit to the supermarket, we are at risk of being shouted at by police on our daily government-sanctioned hour of exercise, and we hover over our finances and food supplies with trepidation. All those little routines we never used to think about - the quiet building blocks for our resilience - shattered in a matter of weeks. Meanwhile, we live in fear of an invisible virus and obsess over symptoms lists.Public Health England’s guidance on how to cope with this brave new world includes maintaining contact with friends and family via the telephone, video calls or social media, keeping to a regular sleeping pattern, and focusing on a hobby. It’s perfectly sensible advice, but it can’t come close to addressing the damage this crisis is doing to our mental health.A recent Ipsos-MORI poll revealed 62 per cent of Britons were finding it harder to stay positive about the future in the face of the pandemic. Meanwhile 80 per cent of young people with a history of mental ill health have found their conditions have worsened since the crisis began. Distressing reports coming from Covid wards suggest there may be many frontline workers, survivors of the virus, and bereaved families requiring mental health support in the coming months.One hundred days in, we still don’t know when this will end, nor how, and it’s impossible to predict exactly where we might be 100 days from now. But while we can’t control what happens in the coming weeks and months, we can try to get a handle on how we react to all this. Mind, which was given a £5 million grant by the Government last week to administer to mental health charities around the country, advises that we all take extra steps to help combat anxiety during this period.Take a break from the news cycle maintain social contact stay hydrated, well fed, mentally stimulated and physically active keep taking your medication if you are on any (if you have a repeat prescription you might be able to order it by phone, online or using an app, and your GP can still have an appointment with you over the phone) and above all don’t leave it too long to seek help. Start by talking about how you feel with someone you trust. Start today.I don’t have to look far to find a picture of how exercise has changed over the past 100 days. As I write these words from the shed at the bottom of my garden, I can see my neighbour doing inverted press-ups, using TRX bands that he’s strung from the back of his house. Inside my own house, my partner and kids are learning ‘spidey squats’ with Joe Wicks on YouTube. Later, I’m hoping to nip out for an hour on my bike, to take advantage of the empty roads. On a weekday.The last time I checked, before coronavirus made its way to the UK, we were in the doldrums of February - a time of hibernation and cancelled gym subscriptions. Now, a few weeks later, it’s as though we’re back in the heady days of early January, intent on working off the excesses of Christmas. Exercise is everywhere and we’re not deterred by barriers from getting it. Yoga studio closed down? No problem: we’ll do a class over Zoom. London Marathon cancelled? Who cares: we’ll run it virtually. Gym doors shut? What you want is Wicks on the TV, or some TRX bands in your garden.The question for the next 100 days is simple: will we keep going? New Year, New You health kicks tend to slide into guilty deferrals (‘next year, new me’). So how resolute is this current trend?I have hope. All around us, exercise is being reframed as an expression of our freedom. When it’s the one thing you can do outside every day, going for a run or a ride feels less like a chore, more like something that’s actually quite fun. The lockdown might not be in place in 100 days\u0027 time, but perhaps the reminder that exercise makes us feel good, and it\u0027s freely (or easily) available to everyone, will stay in our minds?The gym industry is going to have to work out where it fits in this new, more egalitarian world of exercise. The traditional gym certainly won’t die - you’ll always have people who want to work out away from their own homes, and the hardcore bunnies who love the wrought iron atmosphere - but expect big chains to start competing for the online class space. And don’t be surprised if you see personal trainers trying their luck here either: online workouts offer a way for them to teach clients without having to pay rent or commission to a gym landlord. Embrace Zoom, and you might just find your weekly PT session dropping in price.For the nation’s backbone of small and medium-sized businesses, surviving the next 100 days will be an achievement in itself.  They are adaptable and resilient, but few businesses could emerge unscathed from the plunge in demand triggered by the coronavirus lockdown.From cheesecake makers in Preston to door-makers in Buckingham and car-parts makers in Worcester, erse businesses are facing the same stark question: How can you carry on, when the customers have disappeared?Added to the practical problems of poorly staff and looking after their own families, life in recent weeks has been a difficult haze for the millions of striving bosses in this crucial sector which supports 22m employees.Much of their energy since the national lockdown on March 23 has been spent trying to navigate the financial support put in place by the government - on hold with banks, haggling with landlords over rent holidays, deferring VAT payments, or talking to equally stressed suppliers.Only once those conversations have taken place and options are exhausted will it become clearer which businesses will make it through. Insolvency practitioners are braced for a wave of business once bosses work out where they stand.It\u0027s clear the government support will not solve all of businesses’ problems, even with the welcome improvements to the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme that were introduced at the start of April, and pressure on banks to lend.Many companies are reluctant to borrow given the uncertainty over how quickly demand will recover. Putting staff on government-funded paid leave is helping bosses avoid lay-offs, but doesn’t help those who still need workers to help re-right the business, but cannot afford to pay them.Given the shock to demand, there is stress on all sides, and no easy way out. Legal challenges loom between suppliers and customers, tenants and landlords. Radical solutions being floated -  such as getting stronger companies to take over struggling rivals or the government taking equity stakes - are likely to gain more traction.Yet the simple biggest help to many companies would be some clearer guidance about when lockdown might be lifted - for financial planning as much as a psychological boost to bosses thinking about throwing in the towel. Hence ministerial attempts to dodge questions about the exit strategy are exasperating.In the meantime, companies will need to adapt, and many are already doing so. Many are selling vouchers for when they re-open making use of back-up supply chains organised during preparations for a no-deal Brexit opening up new online sales channels or even putting resources at the use of the NHS.There is hope then, that July 18 will be marked by successes along with the inevitable defeats.As the world has ground to a halt, virtually all travel companies are facing an existential threat. March would normally have been an important month for advance bookings - airlines and operators rake in cash as people book ahead for their spring and summer holidays. Instead, the vast majority of flights have been grounded and the industry - from hotels to airlines - has spent the last five or six weeks trying to cope with a deluge of cancellations and requests for refunds.Without more help from the government or a sudden change in fortune, significant numbers seem certain to collapse under the financial strain. We are likely to end up with fewer travel agencies, tour operators and - probably -  airlines too. We may well see some big names go under.But the one thing which would help save the bulk of the industry is the main summer holiday season. As chance would have it, the next 100 days of Covid-19 will take us to July 18. That’s just before most schools are expected to break up for the summer - assuming they return in the meantime. It is peak time for nearly all holiday companies - the six weeks or so when they make their key revenues for the year.The prospect of a successful summer is now on a knife edge and depends on two things. First that lockdown is a success, not just in the UK but also in the key Mediterranean holiday destinations, and it can be relaxed sufficiently to allow international travel. And second, that people feel confident - and solvent - enough to take a foreign holiday. Given the chance, the travel trade will no doubt attempt to drive bookings by offering exceptionally good deals. Even so, they are likely to have a battle on their hands to win back custom.France seems likely to be one testing ground. Once restrictions are lifted, we may see the first shoots of recovery among British travellers taking their own cars across the Channel. But the recovery of air travel will be crucial. Some airlines - Jet2 for example - say they will start flying again on May 1. Ryanair and British Airways look more realistic in planning for a significant increase in services from June onwardsBritain’s biggest tour operator, TUI is allowing customers to postpone existing bookings made before the end of June. Clearly it is hopeful to be able to operate during those key months of July and August.In short, the timing looks incredibly tight. If we are to avoid a lost summer of foreign holidays and the decimation of the travel industry, the battle against Covid-19 needs to go seamlessly.The prospects for holidays in this country look more rosy, however. Assuming travel restrictions in the UK are lifted relatively soon, hotels, holiday cottages, camping and caravan sites should be well back on track by mid July. Given the pent up demand from a public driven stir-crazy by lockdown, this summer may be boom-time for British holidays.So far, coronavirus has frozen the housing market, begun a mass withdrawal of mortgage options and halted most major housebuilding projects. Buyers and sellers have been thrown into a painful limbo. And many have started to worry seriously about house prices.So what’s next? First, transactions are going to tank. The government has effectively banned house sales unless buyers and sellers are legally bound to go ahead. In some weeks in April and May, Capital Economics forecasts falls in mortgage approvals and transactions of more than 90 per cent year-on-year. This would match what happened in China during lockdown. Overall, across the next three months, the research firm expects a 70 per cent drop in sales compared to the same period in 2019. Sales are unlikely to resurge fast after lockdown has been lifted. Savills has based its predictions on an assumption that transactions will stay at as much as 40 per cent below their five year average until September. Estate agents’ commission books are going to take a nasty hit.But that is not the same as a house price crash. It is in fact possible that so few transactions will take place that there won’t be enough data to produce some house price indexes.When the lockdown lifts, some purchases that were put on hold will go ahead as previously planned, but everyone in the market will be newly cautious - buyers of getting into negative equity and vendors of under-selling. We will almost certainly be in a recession. Stock levels will be low, but some people will have to take price cuts and sell. Savills forecasts a short-term price drop of between 5 and 10 per cent.Still, the number of forced sellers should be low. The Government has made swift measures to protect jobs, earnings and home ownership. Airbnb landlords, who will have lost their cash flow with the collapse of the travel industry, will find themselves on a pressure point. In 100 days, we will have seen a mass influx of these properties first to the long-term lettings market, and then perhaps to sales. But far more home owners should be stable than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Then, as with the crash in the early Nineties, the house price plunge followed a period of exponential growth. This time around, our market was not volatile but tentatively recovering from a low base. Many buyers who currently have transactions on hold haven’t thought about renegotiating because they had already got themselves, say, a 10 per cent discount. There isn’t the same cliff edge to fall off. Overall for 2020, both Capital Economics and Knight Frank forecast price falls of only 3 per cent, with recovery starting in 2021.This was meant to be the year Boris Johnson would get Brexit done on January 31, and dusted on December 31 by seeing the United Kingdom out of its transition period on time.The first part of the Prime Minister’s plan went off without a hitch, thanks to his election win helping him steamroller parliamentary opposition. But his hefty Commons majority has not been able to stop Covid-19 from throwing a ner in the works of the post-Brexit talks.After negotiators faced off in their first round of talks at the start of March, the UK and EU had to ert increasing amounts of money, manpower and attention to the raging pandemic rather than preparing for life fully outside of the bloc. Coronavirus soon made it unsafe for negotiators to meet in person, with Michel Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost having to lie low after showing symptoms of the disease.With negotiators reduced to a back and forth of emails and attempts to make the most with remote communication technology, progress has been glacial. Talks have little advanced from opening demands. But in less than 100 days, both sides have to decide if they want to extend the transition period in order to allow more time to negotiate their future relationship.Before coronavirus reared its ugly head, Boris Johnson threatened in February to ramp up preparations to leave without a deal unless negotiators made enough progress by June, nailing down key areas like fisheries and financial services. With the sufficient progress now nigh-on impossible, barring a last-minute erasure of red lines in a desperate grab for a deal, the Prime Minister will have to decide how ready he is to make good on that threat.Meanwhile, European politicians are piling pressure on him to seek a delay, knowing well how vehemently he ruled out such an idea.The UK Government insists for now that it will not budge in its refusal to string out negotiations, but even stalwart Brexiteers are bracing themselves privately for such a delay to be agreed. Expect it only to happen at the very last minute ahead of the July deadline, when it is beyond doubt how badly Covid-19 has disrupted everything.Coronavirus has already struck down the Prime Minister, UK and EU negotiators and any chance of both sides steaming towards a good deal by July. Mr Johnson will be fighting until the last minute not to have its cherished transition deadline enter its own “delay phase”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"many people may already have immunity coronavirus german study","story":"Many more people may have been infected with the coronavirus and acquired immunity than previously thought, according to a groundbreaking study in Germany.Scientists studying the town at the epicentre of Germany\u0027s first major outbreak said they had found antibodies to the virus in people who had shown no symptoms and were not previously thought to have been infected.Initial results released on Thursday suggest as many as 15 per cent of the town may already have immunity — three times as many as previous estimates.The findings suggest the mortality rate for the virus in Germany is just 0.37 per cent — five times lower than current estimates.“This means a gradual relaxation of the lockdown is now possible,” Prof Hendrik Streeck, the virologist leading the study told a press conference.“Because the people in Germany have been so careful and disciplined, we are now able to move on to the second phase.”But Angela Merkel dashed hopes of an early end to the lockdown, telling Germans: “We must not be reckless now. We could very quickly destroy what we have achieved.”The study in the town of Gangelt in Heinsberg district is the first in Europe to research the effects of the virus on an entire community.Scientists from the University of Bonn are testing around 1,000 people from 400 households for antibodies as well as signs of current infection.Initial results based on around half the tests found 2 per cent of inhabitants are currently infected and 14 per cent had antibodies to the virus. Allowing for overlap that suggests 15 per cent of people in the town now have immunity — compared to the previous estimate of 5 per cent.The 15 percent is not that far from the 60 per cent we need for herd immunity, Prof Gunther Hartmann, another of the study\u0027s leaders, said.“With 60 to 70 per cent herd immunity, the virus will completely disappear from the population. Then the elderly are no longer at risk.”The figures cannot be extrapolated to the rest of Germany because Gangelt had a higher rate of infection. But the study\u0027s authors said they were grounds for cautious optimism.  An immunity rate of 15 per cent is already enough to slow the spread of the virus significantly, they said in a joint statement.The findings suggest the mortality rate of the virus may be lower than previously thought. The study found a mortality rate of 0.37 per cent, compared to Johns Hopkins University’s current estimate for Germany of 1.98 per cent.The study\u0027s authors said their findings could be closer to the real figure for the virus because they had detected so many previously unknown infections.“The much lower mortality rate in Gangelt is explained by the fact this study is detecting all infected people, including those with no symptoms or very mild illness,” they said.Antibody testing for the virus is still in its early stages. Chinese scientists released a study confirming they had detected antibodies for the first time this week, but warned they were unable to detect any in some patients known to have been infected.It is unclear how long any immunity to the virus conferred by a previous infection will last, although experience with similar viruses suggests it will be in the range of a year to 18 months.“I think the most important thing all governments can do to address the virus is to get reliable data,” Prof Streeck, the study leader, told the . “We don’t yet know enough about this virus.”The study’s authors said the findings were grounds to begin lifting the current general lockdown and move on to a phase of isolating the vulnerable groups most at risk.Jens Spahn, the German health minister, earlier suggested an easing of the lockdown could be possible after Easter “We are seeing a positive trend, but it must continue,” Mr Spahn said. “If it does, we will be able to talk… about a gradual return to normality after the Easter holidays.”But Mrs Merkel appeared to play down hopes for an early easing of restrictions amid concerns people may be less disciplined about social distancing over the Easter holidays.“I would like to be the first to tell you everything is as it was and we can go back to normal, but that’s not how it is, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"popes representativ lockdown enables us focus true needs instead","story":"The Pope’s representative in England and Wales has said that the pandemic lockdown is an opportunity to reassess our priorities and focus on our true needs instead of fleeting desires. On Easter Sunday Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, will broadcast a special service on BBC Local Radio stations. His sermon will focus on the impact of coronavirus and how it is a chance for us to “reset our sights” and reassess our priorities and that “in a time of darkness and anxiety”.He will say: “Today, we can reset our sights, focussing on our true needs and on our finest gifts. “This time of great testing enables us to distinguish what is truly important from all that is fleetingly desired and has so often mistakenly beene given pride of place in our ambitions. “Already we have to look forward to the rebuilding of our common life, may the light of the risen Christ guide and inspire us in that task.” Cardinal Nichols will also include comments from a frontline doctor who will talk about her experience of being with people who are dying and a civil servant who will discuss the rebuilding of the nation in the wake of the pandemic.The Catholic leader will be offering his sermon at a time when all religious buildings and places of worship have been forced to close in order to curb the spread of coronavirus.He will also say in his sermon: “This truth of Christ’s rising from the dead gives us courage to face the cold embrace of death with great trust in the promise of Jesus, that he will bring us with him into a life more powerful than death and more glorious too.” The Easter sermon will be held on Sunday morning 8am on all 39 BBC local radio stations and will be available on BBC Sounds afterwards.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us firm claims can deliver matt hancocks promise 100000 coronavirus","story":"A single US firm has claimed it is on track to deliver Matt Hancock’s target of 100,000 coronavirus tests every day by the end of the month.Thermo Fisher Scientific, based in Massachusetts, said it had the capacity to deliver all the tests needed to hit the Health Secretary’s ambitious target laid out last week.The company has signed a major deal with the Government to ramp up tests at a laboratory in Milton Keynes, and said it would work around the clock to hit the deadline.In recent weeks the Government has faced heavy criticism as Britain\u0027s mass testing programme continues to lag far behind other nations including Germany and South Korea – as  illustrated in the below graph from earlier this week.In response, the Health Secretary last week launched a five-pillar strategy to ramp up testing in the UK to 100,000 every day by the end of the month.The  revealed on Thursday how NHS leaders told the Health Secretary during a frank conference call on Wednesday that their current testing targets would be jam tomorrow without significant outside help.Mark Stevenson, chief operating officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific, said his firm alone could deliver the target by the end of April. The company will also initially produce antigen tests to tell people whether they have the virus.Mr Stevenson told the BBC: We began mobilising actually straight away after we learned about the Covid-19 outbreak and we designed the kit to identify the virus\u0027s unique genetic code.Then we worked in a way to test that, validate that in patients. And then we began to scale up our manufacturing to meet demand.We agreed with the UK that we would supply to meet their demand of more than 100,000 tests per day.Mr Stevenson said the kits are currently produced outside the UK but the firm had agreed to use its UK bases to produce kits for local supply.Here in the UK we have about 5,000 employees and about 26 sites, so we already have a very large presence, he said.Mr Stevenson said Amazon was involved in moving the test kits from the firm\u0027s bases to UK testing centres.In recent days ministers have unveiled major partnerships with private firms and universities after admitting that NHS labs alone would not be able to plug the gap in testing.The pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca aims to deliver a validated Covid-19 antibody test by the beginning of May that could be scaled up by the end of that month, its UK president said on Thursday.Tom Keith-Roach said the focus is on antigen tests, which can tell people whether they have the virus, but work is also ongoing on an antibody test.Antibody tests are seen as a vital route out of lockdown, enabling those who have had the the virus to resume normal life and get back to work.AstraZeneca, Cambridge University and GlaxoSmithKline have joined forces for a testing facility in Cambridge with the aim of delivering 30,000 antigen tests by the start of May.AstraZeneca and GSK are supporting three other testing centres in Milton Keynes, Alderley Park and Glasgow.Mr Keith-Roach said pharmaceutical firms are working together in the national interest to overcome global supply problems with the chemicals and swabs needed for testing.He said testing kits have 79 components, including reagents and other chemicals, and six are subject to constraints.On each of those six components and swabs, we\u0027re working with the Government, we\u0027re working with GSK, he said.We all obviously have global supply chains that reach into China, that reach into all of our trading partners around the world.Experts are also looking at alternative reagents or alternative components to deal with and mitigate some of those risks, he said.But at this stage, we\u0027re confident that we\u0027re going to have the capacity to do 30,000 a day and that\u0027s why we felt able to make that commitment.Mr Keith-Roach said the aim is for antigen and antibody tests to be carried out by people in their own homes.Clinicians across the country are trying to do absolutely everything possible right now to keep patients out of the healthcare system and to deliver diagnostics of care at home – to not expose patients for unnecessary risk, he said. That will be the principle here.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/05/09/strawberry-crops.jpg","title":"coronavirus farming jobs search record feed nation campaign","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Tens of thousands apply for agricultural work after warnings over fruit picker shortageMore than 30,000 people have applied for farming jobs after a campaign to feed the nation began two weeks ago.Jobs websites said they had seen record numbers of searches for farm work including fruit picking since farmers put out the call for extra staff.The UK faces an imminent shortage of labour, with many of the migrant workers who typically do seasonal farm work unable to travel from their home countries due to restrictions put in place during the coronavirus pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesConcordia, the charity tasked with filling the gap, said 30,000 people had expressed an interest and around 2,000 were currently being matched to roles on farms.Almost nine in 10 of those who have applied are UK citizens and less than one-third have a farming background.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we’re committed to working with others groups and organisations who come might along to help meet the needs of the community in different ways as time goes on.”He said the group has a pool of over 250 volunteers and an on call rota who are now getting several dozen calls a day from people in the area in “real need” of supplies.“Whatever help\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspcan give in mapping the support network across the country is a good thing, especially if it means more people get access to the support they need,” Mr Vine added.Many food aid charities have been struggling with a drop in donations and a fall in the number of regular volunteers.

There are a lot of people are struggling to make rent, struggling with loss of income, struggling to access universal credit, as well as isolating for health reasons.

Yet some arts charities have switched gears and stepped in to help, delivering emergency food packages to people in desperate need.The Auckland Project – an organisation delivering cultural and education programmes in the northeast town of Bishop Auckland – is now leading a huge emergency food operation to deliver supplies to vulnerable people in County Durham.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting the work going on across the UK to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak, backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Auckland Project is an impressive example of how small groups are adapting to the crisis. Based at Auckland Castle, the kitchen staff at the visitor cafe are now cooking 500 fresh meals a day. More\u0026nbspthan 10,000 of the frozen meals have been dropped off at homes in the area over the past few weeks.“We knew a big section of the community would be hit hard by this, so we felt getting food out to those in need was the best way to help,” said Liz Fisher, one of the directors at the project. “It means big changes, but the staff wanted to do all they could – they really stepped up.”How to support our campaignThe Auckland Project’s team of 17 staff and volunteers has been busy working in the kitchen, preparing dishes such as cottage pie, lasagne, mince and dumplings and carrot cake for distribution.There is a move to grow food locally, too. Two acres of the castle’s walled garden has now been set aside for planting potatoes, beans, leeks, cabbages and asparagus.“Hopefully we can start getting the food we grow here into our meals, and possibly even have a celebration dinner once we get past the crisis,” said Ms Fisher.The charity has teamed up with the South Durham Enterprise agency and another local charity called Health Express to work out which iniduals and families need support.Chris Bowron – owner of The Miners Arms on the outskirts of Bishop Auckland – is also part of the emergency food drive. His closed-up pub acts a distribution hub for the local “mutual aid” group, and Mr Bowron and a team of volunteer drivers deliver around 150 frozen meals from The Auckland Project each day.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones.

Only in China is a lockdown being phased out.\u0026nbspSo much is unknown.The message from the government’s chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer this week has been that the UK needs to get past the peak before lifting measures can even be considered.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut once the pandemic\u0026nbspis over, the government will have to start lifting measures. Here’s what we know about how restrictions could potentially be phased out.The government’s guidelines tell people to avoid going outside except for a small set of activities: limited exercise, buying food and medicine, going to an essential job, or giving care.If lockdown measures are to be relaxed, says Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, it would probably be done by gradually expanding the range of these exceptions.“I would do it one step at a time and expand the number of exceptions more widely in a gradual way,” he tells The Independent.“Then look at the more social things a bit later, and say people can meet with their families now, but don’t go to rock concerts and large pub quizzes, things like that. I think that’s the way it would happen.”Some things would probably\u0026nbspcome before others. But he sounds a note of caution: “We don’t know for certain and I think people are trying to work on this at the moment.“At present the\u0026nbspUK has not made it clear what our exit strategy will eventually be and there are very good reasons for this. We simply do not have enough information to make these decisions now. For example, we still do not have good data on the amount of asymptomatic illness in the community, knowledge that is vital to know what may happen after any relaxation of restrictions.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailOffices and other workplaces\u0026nbspThe government is expected to initially try to get as much economic activity for as little risk as possible: prioritising businesses that contribute to the economy without mixing too many people into one place.“I suspect that what would happen is that we would see relaxation first around areas that are more important to society and the economy,”\u0026nbspsays Prof Hunter. “For example, jobs:\u0026nbsppeople would be able to go back to work, possibly more freely than they are at the moment.”But one of the requirements for workplaces to reopen, says Dr Sridhar Venkatapuram of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, is a higher level of confidence about who is immune, and who has the disease.“Imagine that your boss calls you and tells you to go back to work: you might say, well, is it safe?” he tells The Independent.“There’s going to have to be a point at which iniduals are convinced that there is safety in being able to go out of their house and engage in work or any of the activities that they’re used to.“So if this phasing out is going to happen there will have to be a dramatic improvement in the knowledge of our infections, where they are, who has them.“You could implement a phasing out policy tomorrow but I guarantee you that a significant population would stay home: because they would say they don’t trust it. A massive amount of testing will have to be done, greater clarity about levels of infections – that all has to be implemented to follow through on the phasing out.”Many jobs that could continue to be done from home might be still advised to do so. There is also the question of how to cater for people who have already lost their job.“They will also be trying to get as many people who are unemployed, I would think, into jobs that don’t have high social interactions,” says Dr Venkatapuram.Pubs, bars and restaurantsBut it would be unlikely that all workplaces would come back at the same time. Those where the risk of the disease being passed around is highest would probably\u0026nbspbe put on the back-burner.“I could still imagine an easing of pressure on people going to work, but not on things like clubs and pubs and bars and cinemas – things that you don’t have to have,” says Prof\u0026nbspHunter.“I think we will initially see an expansion of the number of industries encouraged to return to normal work, then the reopening of schools and, somewhat later, bars and clubs and other entertainment venues. However, we will still need effective disease surveillance followed by isolation and rigorous contact tracing for some months.”Pints and date night films at the cinema might be some of the last things to come back.The closure of schools is one of the more scientifically controversial parts of the lockdown, but\u0026nbspthey might end up being one of the first things to reopen.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Prof\u0026nbspHunter tells The Independent.“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”But when schools do eventually open their doors again, it’s possible that they could do so with some restrictions in place on pupils.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars\u0026nbspoutbreak in China, suggests students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” says Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.The Times on Wednesday reported one anonymous “senior minister” saying educational establishments could open again after Easter – though in public the government has given no hint of what might come.Sporting and cultural eventsUnfortunately for sports fans, football matches and other mass gatherings look like they will be the last parts of society to return to normal – they simply involve too many people.“What it will be is a slow allowing people to go back to work where they will not be in crowded or group situations.”Thus, Glastonbury is likely to remain cancelled the Premier League postponed – along with other major events.What will come next?\u0026nbspMost experts are agreed that increased testing and “contact tracing” are crucial to allowing society to return to normal as quickly as possible. But even with these measures, some are warning that\u0026nbsplockdown measures could be switched on and off for months until a vaccine is found, or enough people build up immunity – both prospects are potentially one or two years away.“To see us through the next year or more, we must all prepare for several cycles of a ‘suppress and lift’ policy,” Dr Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong wrote in The New York Times.“Cycles during which restrictions are applied and relaxed, applied again and relaxed again, in ways that can keep the pandemic under control but at an acceptable economic and social cost.” The end of the lockdown may not be the first end of the lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not. It’s her habit of thinking out loud that could be the death of The Steph Show, though.“Hey! Let’s have our own talent show.

I sense a vacancy in the offing.BASKET-case football club Sunderland and its army of long-suffering fans are trapped in an abusive relationship with Netflix.Every couple of years the streaming service gets to broadcast the most heartbreaking and brilliant documentary series anywhere on television, Sunderland ’Til I Die.In , they get defeat, ridicule, embarrassment and another story of failure told largely through the bracketed series of doom-laden captions that accompany every fresh disappointment: “Indistinct chatter”, “Seagulls cawing”. “Man yells”. “Jack Ross screams”. “Men chant gregariously”, and always “Tense music playing”.You get the impression, of course, the supporters love the attention that comes with losing which, in turn, tends to attract  prophets and publicity-crazed “saviours” to the club. Series two begins with a new owner, Stewart Donald, arriving at The Stadium Of Light along with public schoolboy executive director Charlie Methven, very much the David Brent of the piece, who understands only two things, attendance figures and metaphors and should’ve been ridden out of town the moment he turned up wearing pink corduroy trousers.Improbably, Sunderland also seem to have found a brilliant striker, Josh Maja, who you absolutely know is on the first stage out of Dodge the moment he arrives to turn on Sunderland’s Christmas lights and promises: “I’ll be here next year.”From that point on, disaster’s guaranteed but has to be spelt out to Charlie and Stewart by Graham at the Roker Rapport podcast: “If Will Grigg was the manager’s signing, how come he can’t find a way to play him ”“Um . . . ”BEFORE Friday night, I was convinced a mixture of resolution and good humour would see us through this crisis.No bad thing, but they also need to ditch the host, two guestsand Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, who all appeared, via Skype and remote cameras, in front of their own chosen back-grounds, on Friday.An open invitation to reveal the inner tosspot, they weren’t ever going to refuse.Hislop had a vast library behind him, as befits the intellectual colossus he imagines himself to be, while feminist author Helen Lewis was carefully positioned in front of her new book, exploiting a global pandemic for commercial gain in a manner that seems to be perfectly acceptable to the BBC, so long as you’re left-wing.If your stomach wasn’t already turned enough, the following half hour probably did the job as the four lists and host Steph McGovern cackled demonically at the brilliance of their own route-one puns.“Hasn’t Boris got his Churchill moment now ”Hislop: “Yes. Churchill the dog!

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim.

That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all need to take responsibility here. This is not about overreach.“We had scurrilous stories a few weeks ago about officers snooping through baskets and removing Easter eggs and that became a trading standards issue.“That is not what the police are there to do. As I said the police are there for public order.“I will be very candid, not everyone will get this right. It will take a few weeks to have these measures bed in.“We want our public spaces to be respected and utilised in the right way.“This is not about heavy handed law enforcement. I pay credit to the police, and the majority of the British public – these are extraordinary times.“But the fact of the matter is,you’re having a party or having a mass gathering do not be surprisedthe police come up and ask you to stop.“The police are using a common sense approach. Enforcement will always be used as a last resort.”In her interview Priti went on to accuse Yvette Cooper of playing politics and insisted she had given the Labour MP a date to appear in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee.When askedshe was concernedYvette wanted to publicly quiz her over bullying allegations made before the start of the crisis, and whether she wanted to deny those on the record, Priti answered: “This is not what this is about at all.“I have offered the chair of the committee regular briefings throughout this pandemic, including access to classied material.“It is disappointing to see this at the time of the crisis when I have already offered a date. There is politicking going on.“When you look at the work of the Home Office during this pandemic, by making  calls free of charge, through the extension of NHS visas, to ious things we’ve been doing across fraud, cyber, national security, policing every single day and the help we are giving to the front line – a lot of that is self evident.“I quite frankly think it is politicking, when we have given access to the entire committee to the department, to myself in terms of another date.“I just think it’s politics basically.”Priti also went on to give up an update about Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who on Thursday night was moved to a ward after spending three nights in intensive care at St Thomas Hospital in London.She said: “He is doing well from what we’re hearing, but we should take great heart that he is in the care of the NHS. We are rooting for him. He is really great, we just want him to get well now.”“I spoke to him last week, around the last cabinet meeting and then it was clear he was unwell and that he needed rest and recoup.“He has been working flat out leading us through this, we need to give him the time and space to recover. We wish him well.”During the interview Priti went on to say the government were considering new measures to help domestic violence victims and confirmed she would be laying out the plans next week.She said of domestic abuse victims on lockdown with their partners: “This is an absolute priority for the police.“I have spent a lot of time speaking to charities and third parties and also the victims commissioner.“There is a lot of work taking place, I have already been resourcing this area. But of course the longer the pandemic continues there will be all sorts of issues around people staying at home and victims of abuse being with their perpetrators. We are finding other ways we can give them the support but also ways we can do more in prevention and protection.“I have been doing a lot of work with this sector and charities about how we can improve our response and get resources out there on the front line in dferent ways. I will be outlining these in the days to come but I can assure you that when it comes to vulnerable children and domestic abuse victims there is a lot of cross government work taking place.”Priti also discussed the increased threats to the public from online fraudsters since the beginning of the pandemic.She said: “I spend every day looking at threats and risks to homeland security. We are seeing all sorts of things but we are especially seeing new threats from online harms and threats in terms of cyber fraud and breaches of cyber security.“As a result there are more protective measures we are undertaking. For example we are seeing a lot more financial fraud online. We are seeing more activity in the space and sphere on online harms particularly around vulnerable people and children and I am working with the National Crime Agency on this right now.“The wrong types of people, perpetrators of crime are at home and are spending a lot of time on the internet, so a lot of work is taking place across the whole of law enforcement, the crime agency, our security and intelligence services as well.“We absolutely are on it.“I will be very candid, they themselves are facing challenges themselves in terms of how they are working.“Across the policing and intelligence community they are incredible in what they are doing but the intelligence they are being fed in – we are actually seeing less crime but they are actually dealing with more crime because they are able to see more crime, perhaps in a way in which they haven’t been able to previously.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which was first identied in the Chinese city of Wuhan - could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale at a wet market.Those markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve.Following the outbreak of the virus, China banned the breeding, trading and consumption of wildle - revoking all existing licenses.It also promised to revise legislation to make the ban permanent.The draft guidelines published yesterday - which have been opened to the public for consultation - listed  traditional livestock species, including cattle, pigs, poultry and camels.The notice also added  special species that would also be exempt from wild animal trading restrictions, including reindeer, alpaca, pheasants, ostriches and foxes.Dog consumption has become increasingly unpopular in China and the southern city of Shenzhen became the first to ban it last month.However, the Humane Society International, an animal welfare group, estimated that around  million dogs a year are still killed in China for meat, including stolen pets.The city of Yulin in the region of Guangxi holds an annual dog meat festival in June.There, stray dogs or stolen pet dogs are trapped in tiny cages where they cannot breathe or even stand up properly.The animals are then transported to a slaughterhouse in Yulin, south-west China.Charity Humane Society International has said that as many as  dogs are killed at the abattoir every day.Wendy Higgins, a Humane Society International spokeswoman, said: This draft proposal could signal a game-changer moment for animal protection in China."},{"url":null,"title":"change health conditions lockdown twice","story":"A NEW change in lockdown rules means people with certain health conditions can now leave home twice a day.It comes after a legal discussion between Public Health England and a firm representing two autistic children who need to leave twice for their health.Now those with health conditions which require them to leave home more than once a day will be allowed to do so.The updated guidance now reads: You can leave your home for medical need.If youhave a specic health condition that requires you to leave the home to maintain your health -

A leaked transcript of a Zoom meeting involving Passport Office managers, reported by the BBC, suggested up to , members of staff couldto work on routine passport applications. According to the transcript Home Office deputy scientic adviser, Rupert Shute, told the meeting: “You are no more at risk at the workplace as you would be in your home or at the supermarket. It is about minimising it.” He reportedly added: “We are working on the assessment that % of us,we havenapost already, will get the virus. We cannot hide away from it forever. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS Union said: “It is absolutely scandalous that HMPO are suggesting our members can go back into work during a pandemic to process routine passports. The cavalier approach to our membersapos health and safety is shameful and ultimately puts them in greater danger of contracting Covid-. We have already had members die as a result of contracting corona and pressured civil service managers in other departments to shut offices so staff can work from home. For the deputy chief scientic adviser at the Home Office to suggest that going into work does not put you at greater risk of contracting corona is extremely irresponsible and totally contradicts current Government guidance. Processing passports is not critical work while we are in lockdown and international travel is practically non-existent due to the corona pandemic. A Home Office spokesman said: Her Majestyaposs Passport Office is fully adhering to public health advice across all our offices and adopting social distancing measures to keep both its staff and customers safe. It continues to operate at substantially restricted staffing levels with a signicant number of people working from home where possible, and staff are prioritising emergency cases. Guidance is also available for people who are travelling into work. It was made clear in the meeting that the Governmentaposs priority is slowing the spread of coronavirus and we all have a part to play in order to protect the NHS and save lives.  The Home Office added that Government advice has been clear that people may travel for work purposes,they cannot work from home. At a Number  briefing this morning, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I think the government advice is very clear that you may travel for work purposesyou cannot work from home. “That guidance is obviously available for the passport staff who are travelling into work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer shadow frontbench reshuffle","story":"NewsKeir Starmer shadow frontbench reshuffle: New Labour leaders top team in fullA string of party figures - including leadership rival Jess Phillips - have been promoted to junior shadow ministerial rolesShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR NewsLabour leader Keir Starmer has announced his full shadow frontbench team \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Drastic limits on leaving your home will be reviewed by April  - but itaposs clear they wonapost be lted. As coronavirus deaths continue to rocket, they will probably drt on into May at least. A meeting of the COBRA emergency committee today kicked off the process of working out what to do next, chaired by Boris Johnsonaposs deputy Dominic Raab. But the government isnapost planning to actually tighten the law - yet. Instead the focus will be on enforcing the law we already have and making it last longer.  Meanwhile police are preparing for a tough Easter weekend - with threats to search peopleaposs shopping and fine anyone going to bask in the sun. So what can and canapost you do under the lockdown law, what is changing, and when will it all end   Hereaposs the lockdown latest explained. What are the basic lockdown rules  You cannot leave the house where you live without reasonable excuse. That boils down to:Shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home. Gatherings of more than two people are banned in public - unless youaposre from the same household, or a few other exceptions . And pubs, cafes, restaurants, gyms, funfairs, playgrounds, sports courts, cinemas, theatres, nightclubs, bingo halls, concert halls, museums, galleries, car showrooms, casinos, betting shops, spas, hair and beauty salons, barbers, massage parlours, tattoo studios, skating rinks and more must shut.  What is the punishment for breaking the lockdown  Breaking the rules above without reasonable excuse, or obstructing an officer enforcing them, is a criminal offence and you can be prosecuted. However, you can in most cases avoid a criminal conviction by paying a aposfixed penalty noticeapos issued by the police within  days. The law allows police to issue £ fixed penalty notices - rising to £ for a second offence and then doubling each time up to a cap of £. Police, PCSOs, council officers and other government representatives can also order or force you toto your home, and disperse gatherings of more than two people.  When did the UK go into lockdown - and for how long  The lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday  March. It took effect immediately. Police powers to enforce the lockdown took force a few days later - at pm on Thursday  March. The law says the lockdown must be reviewed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock every three weeks, with the first review by Thursday  April. But reviewing the lockdown doesnapost mean it stops. The law is in force for up to six months without the government needing to write a new one. Will the lockdown be extended for longer than three weeks  Yes. The UK government hasnapost made an official announcement because thataposll only come next week. But ministers, civil servants and  Downing Street have been absolutely clear that April  is much too soon to end the lockdown. Wales has already confirmed it will extend the lockdown. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added: I don’t think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lted immediately or even imminently. Even before a COBRA meeting to discuss the lockdown, Downing Street basically confirmed the UK government agrees with Ms Sturgeon.  Why isnapost the extension being announced properly today  Because the government wants to wait to see how well the restrictions are working at reducing cases. A formal announcement will be made on or before April , based on scientic evidence. Whoaposll make the decision  Technically itaposs made by Health Secretary Matt Hancock but itaposll be overseen by Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in, Dominic Raab. Not the PM, whoaposs in intensive care. Downing Street said: The Prime Minister is not working. I think weaposre very clear on that. And he has asked the First Secretary of State to deputise for him. It will be the First Secretary of State who leads the COBRA meeting [on Thursday] and the First Secretary of State who will lead any cabinet decision making process.  So can I go out for a picnic this Easter weekend then  No, absolutely not. Yes, the lockdown is being reviewed, but that absolutely does not mean it has stopped. You may only go outside your home with a reasonable excuse - just like any other day under lockdown. When will the lockdown end  We donapost know. But it will only be lted when the UK is well over the peak of new Covid- cases per day, and thataposs not any time soon. Ministers had hoped the peak would be Easter Sunday but estimates now put it at least a week or two later. Even then, cases have to drastically dwindle too. Otherwise thereaposll just be a second outbreak. The UK government has also repeatedly refused to say what its aposexitapos strategy is. Until we get a vaccine next year, itaposs quite possible they just donapost know yet. Officials havenapost ruled out a partial end to the lockdown, where some people can go outside earlier than others. Or restrictions being lted for a few weeks, then reimposed.  Are even stricter restrictions on the way  Not right now, no. The government hasnapost ruled out making the rules even stricter - such as banning exercise. But No emphasised the focus is on policing the current rules more strictly, not making new ones. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: I think the focus for now is ensuring that people continue to stick by the measures weaposve put in place. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned the government may enhance or change the lockdown, but thataposs not happening right now. No said: Weaposve always said thatthe scientic advice suggested other steps are needed weaposd be prepared to take them. But for now our focus is on ensuring the steps we already have in place are properly enforced. What does the law actually say  The lockdown is enforced through a law called the Health Protection Regulations . Importantly, it isnapost exactly the same as the government guidance. You should of course follow both, but it makes a dference to whether police can stop you going about your business. Here we go through a few common situations. Whataposs the full list of aposreasonable excusesapos for leaving my house  Reasonable excuses include, but it appears are not limited to:To obtain basic necessities, including food and medical supplies for those in the same householdor for vulnerable persons To take exercise either alone or with other members of their household To seek medical assistance To provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, or to provide emergency assistance To donate blood To travel for the purposes of work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work from home To attend a funeral of a member of the person’s household, a close family member, orneither are attending, a friend To fulfil a legal obligation, including attending court or satisfying bail conditions To access critical public services, including childcare school, social services, DWP services, victims of crime services To allow children with shared custody to move between each parentaposs house For a minister of religion, to go to their place of worship To move house where reasonably necessary To avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm.When can more than two people gather in public  Exceptions to the rule are:Where all the people in the gathering are members of the same household Where the gathering is essential for work purposes To attend a funeral To facilitate a house move* To provide emergency assistance* To fulfil a legal obligation* To provide care to a vulnerable person** Where reasonably necessary. Can police fine meI exercise twice in one day  No. Government guidance is clear - you should only exercise once a day. You should follow this advice. But the law itself doesnapost specy how many times you can go out. It just says you may take exerciseyou need to. Meanwhile, guidance has been updated to let people with a medical need go out multiple times a day, for instance people with learning disabilities or autism.  Can police stop me sitting in the park  Yes,you canapost provide a reasonable excuse. You wonapost be surprised to hear the list of possible reasonable excuses does not include sitting, having a picnic or sunbathing - evenyouaposre doing it with proper social distancing. Police have of course been asked to show discretion, and there are exceptions in the rules for people with a medical need. Can police go through my shopping  The law isnapost % clear - but the Home Secretary has said itaposs not appropriate. It comes after a police force threatened to go through peopleaposs bags to check for non-essential items. After an outcry, Northamptonshire Police later claried: We absolutely will NOT be searching peopleaposs shopping trolleys in Northamptonshire. Home Secretary Priti Patel later said this is not appropriate and branded it heavy-handed. So thataposs all good. But what does the law say  The law says you can go out to buy basic necessities, including food and medical supplies. So you might interpret that asyou start buying non-essential items, youaposre breaking the law. But the government also says open shops donapost have to pull all their non-essential items from stock. So Sainsburyaposs can carry on selling, say, kidsapos toys and paddling pools - and thereaposs nothing to stop you buying them. Shops that are still open are free to sell any items that they have in stock, Downing Street told us. Yet Downing Street also told us: When we ask the police to carry out enforcement of any rules we give them discretion on how to do that. Thataposs the nature of policing in the UK. They have set out in guidance to officers that they should engage, explain, encourage and then finally enforce.

Everyone understands the importance of supporting doctors, nurses and other staff on the frontline. That is why you came out in your millions again last night to applaud our  brilliant national health service. But the battle against the pandemic is not just being fought in our hospitals and surgeries. In the scramble to shore up the NHS, the Government appears to have neglected the half a million people in care homes. These residents are almost exclusively in the high-risk category. Yet care home operators say they have been ignored and are struggling to get the help they need. Many are short of staff because workers have had to go into self-isolation. Others desperately want personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves. One home in Luton has reported that  of its residents have died and tragically there are more cases emerging across the country. Without urgent action more lives will be lost. We cannot allow these homes, offering comfort and support, to turn into death traps.

Cardf mum Sue Martin spoke to the BBCaposs Today programme about the fateful call from doctors telling her that her husband was being put on a ventilator, and the shell-shocked family needed to say goodbye.Sue described her -year-old husband Mal Martin as fit and healthy. But the devastated family has been told he has aposzero chanceapos of survival. The mum gave an emotional interview recounting the familyaposs final phone call, and a ten-minute visit behind screens around Malaposs hospital bed. Her description of the moment she and the coupleaposs two children, aged  and , stood behind screens around a sleeping Malaposs bedside to say their goodbyes moved listeners to tears. The family was allowed to go into hospital in full protective wear for what is likely to be the last time they are all together. Malaposs we and children could not even touch him to say farewell as they stood around his bedside at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. Sue recalled: We just told him that we loved him. It was heartbreaking to hear the children tell him that they were going to make him proud. The family have been left to prepare for the beloved husband and fatheraposs death as he lies in intensive care on the brink of organ failure. Despite being told there was no way he would pull through, Sue says the family is living in hope of a miracle.According to the Independent, Mal is chairman of a recruitment firm and Sue is a communications manager at the Department for Transport, and the couple have been together for  years.Mal has Type  diabetes and had suffered a heart attack four years ago, but had lived a very, very healthy le, his we told the Today programme.   Sue said Mal first began feeling unwell with cold-like symptoms on March , and his condition got progressively worse. After about a week, his condition declined so badly he could not get out of bed. Sue told the Independent Mal had a persistent cough, a headache and a temperature of .C. She added in the BBC interview: The cough was the worse thing for him. It was like nothing  Iaposve heard before. aposI wish we had been able to give him a hugapos Mal began self-isolating to keep the rest of his family safe as soon as he began feeling unwell. But when his condition did not improve after another week, Sue said she tried to seek medical advice. However she claimed she struggled to get through on attempts to call NHS  services, saying she kept being put on hold for more than an hour each time then was cut off. She then rang a doctor at the local surgery, who encouraged her to keep a record of Malaposs symptoms and check on him every second hour throughout the days.  But Malaposs symptoms went into sharp decline on March  and Sue said she stayed up all night anxiously checking his condition. At this stage his breathing rate was normal, and the doctor seemed satisfied by his condition and recommended he stay at home at that point. By the early hours of Sunday morning, ten days after he first began showing symptoms of coronavirus his condition was so poor, Sue called an ambulance. She described how his breathing had become rapid, and when the paramedics arrived she and the children were not allowed to go near him. As he was rushed to hospital, they had to say their goodbyes there and then, Sue recalled. She said: It was awful because I wish now that we had been able to give him a hug. She did not know that the worst was yet to come, explaining that the family believed once Mal was admitted to hospital his condition would improve. Sue said: I really thought that a couple of days on oxygen and heaposd be back home with us.  But within around an hour of Malaposs arrival at hospital, she received a call from the AE at the Princess of AE Hospital saying he had whisked straight to intensive careand put on a ventilator. Sue said a doctor told her Mal was very, very sick and the family needed to be prepared that he might not pull through. Sue told Today she never thought her husband would be among the patients fighting for their lives in hospital. She described being shocked to hear that he may not survive, after he had been able to walk out of the family home to a waiting ambulance.  Sue recalled: The nurse said that she had spoken to him and he was aware of what was going to happen to him, and that they were going to put him to sleep and put him on a ventilator to do the breathing for him because his body was very tired and extremely poorly. The last time the family saw each other Sue was surprised to learn that he would soon be unconscious, saying I think I just assumed that a ventilator was like another type of oxygen mask, I didnapost realise it involved him being put to sleep. The nurse told her that Mal had asked for her to call him as he was too upset after he was told he may not ever come off the ventilator. Sue and her children called him over FaceTime, where they saw him struggling to breathe and already wearing an oxygen mask. The family were in tears, realising this might be the last time they were all together again as they were forced to say their goodbyes to Mal.  Sue said: We just told him how much we loved him and I said how much I was really sorry that I hadnapost sent him in earlier... They said in hospital that Iaposd done everything that I could have. He promised he would fight it. She said her husband promised their children he would pull through and be there for him.  He said to my daughter who was , Donapost worry, Iaposm going to be around a while yet and be here for your wedding and for you both growing up and see William play rugby for Wales - heaposs . He was told thathe did recover it would take over a year. Mal texted the family, promising he wouldnapost leave them, Sue said. He said it wasnapost his time, that he missed me too much and that he was coming home. When the text messages ceased, they knew it was because he had been put on the ventilator in ICU. Saying goodbye through a hospital screen She said: That day really was when everything changed for us and we have just been existing since.  She said the hospital had been amazing, with a consultant ringing every day with an update. At first the doctors told the family Mal had   chance of survival. But the -year-old dad is strong, fit and healthy, Sue said. She said the family kept faith when doctors said they would do everything they could to help him. But after a few days on the ventilator, the doctors told her despite their best efforts they had been unable to take him off the ventilator. Then Malaposs kidneys failed, and he was put on dialysis. After that, Sue received the fateful call from the doctors informing the family there was aposalmost zero chanceapos Mal would survive. The doctors told her they were giving him the maximum adrenaline they could to keep the blood pumping to his vital organs. But he was on the brink, and they told Sue they didnapost think they could do anything more for him as it was likely his organs begin failing. Reeling from the news, she rang the hospital again and begged to be able to see her husband. A nurse told Suethe family could get to the hospital quickly, they could have  minutes with Mal and even stayed two hours after her sht to ensure they fulfilled their desperate wish. The nursing sister helped the family dress in full personal protective equipment . Sue said they were taken in to say goodbye to Mal: we werenapost allowed to touch him, but we could speak to him. Essentially we were going in to say our goodbyes. I said to the children... aposyou absolutely donapost have to do this, this is a personal choice, thereaposs no right or wrong. You have to do what you feel.apos But they both wanted very much to come and see him. because they hadnapost been able to really hug him before he left. The family were forced to say their final goodbyes to Mal through screens around his bed. Sue said the medics were wonderful and compassionate.  She recounted the awful scene as she and her children stood around his hospital bed, unable to touch him. It was just like he was asleep. he had so many tubes and obviously wires in him and everything - it was like he was fast asleep. We just told him really that we love him, and it was heartbreaking, really, to hear the childrenthey were going to make him proud. She added: It was very hard not being able to touch him but we were glad to get to see him. aposA little glimmer of hopeapos The family had expected he would not survive Monday, but have since been told his condition has been improved slightly.Doctors said Malaposs lungs and kidneys had failed, but they had noted a slight increase in his blood pressure and were able to reduce his adrenaline .Sue said the family had accepted this did not mean he would survive. She said there had been no improvement or deterioration by Wednesday. He is still extremely, desperately ill and thereaposs still almost zero chance of him pulling through. As the emotional interview came to a close, Sue said the family had not yet given up hope. Although everyday we prepare for the worst, thereaposs a little glimmer of just maybe, just maybe, he might turn a corner. Chances of survival after ventilation slim The latest report into patients admitted into critical care in the UK showed that of those who required ventilation so far, just under a third have survived. Figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, from the intensive care national audit , showed that as at Friday, April , of , patients for whom data was available,  had died.  Another  patients were discharged alive from critical care and , patients were last reported as still being in critical care.

Justine Laymond has a permanently compromised immune system following her le-saving transplant back in  and has one of the worldaposs rarest lung diseases. Speaking to , the -year-old said she knows that catching Covid- would be game over for her, but she is determined to do all she can to stay safe at home. And she is calling on everyone across the UK to do their bit this weekend and asks anyone thinking of breaking the lockdown to simply not do it. She said: The sun may be shining outside - but darkness will fall on others who may die,not yourself. This is not a movie, itaposs reality. Have you got a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror Justine was just hours from dying back in July  when she fought back from being in a three-week coma, spending weeks on le support and  lung collapses to be well enough to be put on the transplant list. Her le was eventually saved when she received the healthy lungs of a -year-old man, and she was given another chance at le. But Justine, who is currently furloughed from her part time job at Hyundai in Chelmsford, admits she is frightened for her health once again. But after spending two days crying over what the deadly virus could mean for her, Justine picked herself up and decided to fight for her le - by staying safe and self-isolating. She said: Iaposm so frightened. Iaposm not going out to exercise every day. I need to keep my fitness up so my lungs stay healthy. But I knowI do get it, I will die. I would fight for my leI did get it, but I know it will kill me. Justine, from Rayleigh, Essex added: Iaposve got my wishes written out.

Justine, who is self-isolating with partner Tom Hipperson, was left in shock when she was not included in the Governmentaposs list of .milllion people most at risk from the virus. Despite being a transplantee, permanently immuno-compromised and having serious underlying health conditions, she did not get a text to say she would have help getting the vital medicines she takes each day, or have any way of getting food. After numerous calls to her GP and hospital, she was eventually told her medical records were not accurate and her medical code needed amending so she could be included on the high risk list.  And now she is back to her positive self, doing fitness classes at home and keeping up her hobbies as a drag queen, where she has a large online presence, and keeping busy with cos-play make up and art. She said: I know Iaposm in lockdown for  weeks, so you just have to change your mindset.

The football-mad dad, who lived in Stoke-on-Trent, was described as a family man and such a lovely guy. His family now face an awful, upsetting time but also an uncertain one as self-employed hairdresser Claire comes to terms with feeding four mouths and herself during the coronavirus lockdown.  Gemma Crank, who is Claireaposs cousin, has set up a GoFundMe page to help the family.Gemma wrote: As many of you will be aware Kevin Davies passed away this morning in hospital after losing his fight against the awful virus that is causing so much heartache in our communities. My cousin Claire and their children now face a not only awful, upsetting time but also an uncertain one with the financial implications that come with this. I want to make it clear that Claire has not asked for this and would never do so. But I know that as a hairdresser she is self employed and will be in a position that many in the country are with paying bills. She added that she set up the GoFundMe page to to help the family through this horrible time. Kind-hearted Brits have rushed to the page to help out the family and almost £, has been raised in less than  hours.  And people have been leaving tributes to Kev, with one describing him as a great lad who loved to play football while others said he was such a lovely man. Another wrote: Fantastic human being I will miss our banter of Stoke and Vale. Colleagues have donated to the cause and expressed their condolences.A colleague wrote: Kev you will be sadly missed the depo will never be the same. And another colleague wrote: RIP KEV your going be missed by many.xx as you said every morning in the depo GO ON STOKE. While another wrote that work just won’t be the same without my wee buddy.Another colleague wrote: Go on Stoke Kevs favorite words in the depot Always smiling Going be sadly missed Absolutely gutted RIP the Bolton legend xxxxxxxxxxxxx. People have been invited to also clap for Kev this evening, to celebrate his le and the NHS heroes who worked tirelessly to try to save his le as the nation applauds together at pm. Today, Gemma added: It is amazing how much has been raised in the last  hours and it shows how much Kev and his family were liked and loved. The money will go a long way in removing the stress of how Claire is going to pay for everything at this horrible time, which allows her to concentrate on herself and the children. Massive thank you again as I know many of you may be in the same position at the minute. Stoke is a city to be proud of.

Professor Karol Sikora said the first step would be to let small businesses with fewer than  staff open again on April . All schools should be allowed to reopen and social distancing measures should be eased on May , the ex-director of the UN bodyaposs cancer unit argued. Offices, bars and restaurants should be able to open their doors again on May , Prof Sikora, a former member of the Department of Healthaposs Expert Advisory Group on cancer, said. The final step ministers should take is easing restrictions on international travel and mass gatherings on June . The professor said: With more testing, no mutation of the virus and compliance with the rules I think this is a feasible timetable. He added: The lockdown is working - we are flattening the curve. But we need to see an exit strategy. With more testing, no mutation of the virus and compliance with the rules I think this is a feasible timetable. During this crisis I have remained an optimist- letaposs hope Iaposm right.  He said that his timeline was contingent on the virus peaking this weekend and people following the Governmentaposs rules.As ministers came under pressure to tell parents whether their children canto the classroom, Robert Halfon said he was worried some kids will be left behind because of the ongoing coronavirus lockdown.Health chiefs insist it is “premature” to say when the restrictions will be lted and they are likely to extend beyond next week.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the review of the ­lockdown will go ahead around Monday, more than three weeks after it was imposed, but refused to put a time on when an exit strategy will start. It is all but certain that schools will not be opening after the Easter break. But heads and MPs have said that, while it would be unsafe toin coming weeks, they would hope to be able to open fully before the end of the summer term in July.As the number of UK deaths rose by  to ,, Mr Halfon – chair of the Education Select Committee – said: “Obviously I want schools to open as soon as possible because I’m really worried about what’s going to happen toleft-behind kids. If they’re stuck at home they’re potentially going to suffer enormously.“Education is the most important thing we can give to children and young people and it’s vital that schools open as soon as the science allows. It has to be a number one priority for the Government.”  Mr Halfon spoke after review from University College London last week cast doubt on the effectiveness of school closures in halting the disease. But unions have stressed the safety of teachers, pupils and the community – must come first. Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the NASUWT, said: “Everyone is anxious toto normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientic evidence. Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community.” Whitehall sources insisted no date had been set to reopen schools in England, and that a date would only emerge once scientic advice concluded it was safe for them to do so. Mr Sunak said: “We committed there would be a review in and around three weeks, that review will be based on the evidence and data, which will only be ­available next week. I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus ­seriously on the here and now.”The authorities face more immediate concerns over the four-day Easter weekend, with the expected warm weather prompting fears that parks and beaches will again be packed.Experts say any easing of social distancing measures relies on widespread testing - which Britain has fallen woefully behind on. Ministers are reportedly preparing to issue a plea to UK industry to build a home antibody test that would help exit the lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised , daily tests by the end of the month so that all stretched NHS staff who are self-isolating can be checked for the virus. The Department of Health said that a new testing laboratory set up by ­AstraZeneca, GSK and Cambridge University would aim to carry out , tests a day by May. It could take weeks before the ­slowdown in infections turns into a fall in daily deaths.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, standing in for the Prime Minister, urged restraint amid signs social-distancing was beginning to work.But with temperatures set to soar over the bank holiday, police warned they were ready to take action against those who flout the rules. One police chief even warned his force was only “a few days away” from imposing roadblocks. The Devon  Cornwall force also said it would be patrolling the M motorway on the Somerset and Devon border to keep tourists away from the area.Military Defence Police, based in Portsmouth and Plymouth, will be operating along the coastlines in Dorset, Devon and Cornall to ensure people aposdo not gather unnecessarilyapos, reported i news on Thursday evening. It comes as Boris Johnson was last night moved back to the ward at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London after his condition improved following three anxious nights in intensive care.A No spokesman said the PM “will receive close monitoring” and was “in extremely good spirits”. The PM’s fiancée Carrie Symonds broke her silence by tweeting multiple clapping hand emojis and a child’s painting of a rainbow, as the country applauded health workers at pm. Government officials are now confident that new coronavirus infections are starting to level off. But as Mr Johnson spent his fth night in hospital, Mr Raab said it was too soon to begin lting the measures brought in almost three weeks ago.  Saying the Government would not even begin re-assessing the lockdown until the end of next week, he urged the public to think “long and hard” about the impact on heroic NHS staffthey ignored the rules. “After all the efforts everybody has made, after all the sacrices so many people have made let’s not ruin it now,” Mr Raab said. “Let’s not undo the gains we’ve made, let’s not waste the sacrices so many people have made. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and to hurt our country.” Apologising that people would not be able to spend time with their families over Easter he added: “The deaths are still rising. It’s too early to lt the measures that we put in place.”  Ministers launched a Stay at Home This Easter publicity drive designed to make sunseekers think twice.And stars from sport, and music backed the message. England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, and Happy Mondays singer Shaun Ryder joined key workers to record clips for a video released by Greater Manchester Police yesterday.The warnings come as new figures showed the number of hospital patients who have died after testing positive rose  to ,. But the rate of new infections appears to have slowed and officials are confident lockdown is working. Sources say they now believe Brits with Covid- are infecting on average less than one person each. This is the crucial reproduction numberthreshold which,kept up, would see the outbreak die out. New daily confirmed cases fell to , yesterday, a signicant drop from , the previous day. This had been falling with , on Tuesday, , on Monday, down from the peak of , on Sunday. Lockdown began after modelling showed the reproduction number– or amount of people each carrier infects – was between  and ., meaning cases doubling every four or five days.  A source leading the response to the crisis said: “If the R goes below , the epidemic just dies out anyway, which is hopefully what’s happening. “If the R is somewhat above  you can control it with active measures.” Daily testing is now starting to be increased to around , after stalling near the , a day mark. But insiders say easing lockdown can only be consideredthe Government meets its ,-a-day target. Even then it can only happensocial distancing has been maintained and hospitals are well within capacity. But the focus is now moving move to a Government “exit strategy”, which it has repeatedly refused to outline.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked ministers to publish plans to get Britain out of the lockdown.He said: “I’m not calling for timings, but the strategy. We need to know plans are in place, and what they are.” Downing Street said police would have the “full support” of Government in enforcing the coronavirus lockdown at this “critical juncture”.

Scientists have discovered what they believe to be the first direct evidence of yarn making. The mm-long cord fragment, found at an archaeological site in Abri du Maras in the south of France. And they think it was made by Neanderthals in the Middle Palaeolithic period , to , years ago. They would have needed basic numeracy skills to create bundles of fibres to make yarn and may have been more advanced than previously thought. An international team, led by Bruce Hardy, a professor of anthropology at Kenyon College in Ohio, US, analysed the cord fragment which was found twisted in three small bundles wrapped around a mm long stone tool. The scientists believe the cord may have been used as a handle for the tool or was part of a net or bag containing the implement. Analysis revealed that these strands were made of cellulose, probably from the inside of coner trees. Dr Marie-Helene Moncel, from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, said: “We are sure that these twisted fibres are not due to a natural process. “We can imagine that this twisted fibres could be the remains of a cord of something you could use it for making bags.” Dr Moncel added that to know when and how to harvest the fibres would have required advanced knowledge of the plants in their environment. Study lead author Prof Bruce Hardy added: “You start by twisting a set of fibres into a strand of yarn. Multiple yarns are twisted to form a cord, multiple cords to form a rope, et cetera.

Highs up to C are forecast, Weather Channel forecaster Brian Gaze said. “Heat is blowing to the UK from the Canary Islands.” Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: “Easter will certainly start warm and dry for many with heat coming from Africa via the Atlantic. And it will largely result in warm temperatures and glorious sunshine for most of the UK, asdetails in our area-by-area breakdown. Southwest Forecasters say temperatures will be in the Cs across most of the southwest of England, including Devon and Cornwall. These should peak on Friday in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and the surrounding area. Itaposll be sunny across the region on Friday but sunny spells with be interspersed with cloud on Saturday. However temperatures will remain between C and C. But on Sunday, the mercury will struggle to exceed C. There is a chance of some rain too on Sunday, particularly across Cornwall and Devon.  Southeast Itaposll be warmest this weekend across the Home Counties, particularly Oxfordshire and Berkshire, on Saturday. In some places, temperatures will peak at C. Itaposll be sunnier in the south of the patch with cloud blighting northern areas, such as Hertfordshire and Essex. Itaposll be warm along the south coast, including at Brighton, East Sussex, but Brits mustnapost be enticed to the seaside. By Sunday, itaposll be cloudier with small chances of showers in the region.  London The capital will be extremely warm and sunny this Easter. Temperatures will soar to C in west London and parts of Surrey on Friday. Saturday will also be a very sunny day in London, particularly in the south and west of the capital. However, there will be light showers on Sunday afternoon. Temperatures will also fall by then too, to around C.  Midlands While itaposll be humid across the Midlands, itaposll also be somewhat cloudy this Easter weekend. Parts of Warwickshire and Worcestershire will see sunny intervals and the mercury hit C on Friday, but thereaposs a threat of rain on Saturday. Showers are most likely across Shropshire and Staffordshire, forecasters say. Sunday will be very cloudy with temperatures struggling to exceed C in the region. Wales West Wales will bask in glorious sunshine on Friday - but again, Brits shouldnapost head for the coast. Sadly, the sun will quickly turn to rainy patches by Friday night, thundery in and around Llandidloes, mid Wales. Cloud will disappear for sun by Saturday afternoon but, again, itaposll turn rainy on Sunday. Temperatures across Wales wonapost exceed C on Sunday, forecasters understand.  East of England Some parts of Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire will be very sunny on Friday and, particularly, Saturday. But itaposll be signicantly colder and windier on the Norfolk and Suffolk coasts. Light showers will ruin the mini-heatwave by Sunday night, when temperatures will fall to C.  Northwest Cloud will struggle to clear across the northwest of England on Friday. In fact, it may become wet and thundery by the evening across Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire. But this region will enjoy its scorching mini-heatwave on Saturday. Itaposll be particularly sunny across Merseyside. Itaposll be hugely cooler on Sunday when cloud will struggle to clear. By then, it could be as cold as C in parts of Cheshire.  Northeast Itaposll be warmest across this region on Saturday, with temperatures peaking at C in Whitby, North Yorkshire. Friday will be somewhat cloudy but itaposll brighten up across the patch on Saturday. Overcast weather will move northwards by Sunday afternoon, with chances of showers across County Durham and Teesside.

Dogs are considered a delicacy in some regions of China. Their current classication as livestock allows them to be bred as food, or to provide milk, fur, or medicine. But that could be about to change as the coronavirus fallout mounts on top of years of international scrutiny calling for an end to the trade in dog meat. Some cities have already taken the law into their own hands in the wake of the Covid- outbreak, which is believed to have started at a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Shenzhen recently passed its own law that went further than the Chinese governmentaposs temporary closure of aposwet markets.aposThe city became the first to prohibit the consumption and production of dog and cat flesh. At wet markets, live animals are bought and sold for consumption and processing for traditional medicines and sometimes slaughtered in front of customers. Concerns about sanitation, wild meat diets, and the unnatural proximity of vast ranges of species in close quarters in such markets had been repeatedly raised by scientists in the years before the Covid- pandemic. The Chinese Agriculture Ministry has now launched a public consultation that could see dogs struck off the menu for good. The ministry has listed animal that can be traded for meat including pigs, cows, chickens and sheep, goats, oxen and camel. But missing from the list of acceptable meat for human consumption are dogs, cats and wild animals including bats, the animals some have linked to Covid-. The new law could be introduced as soon as May .  The directive from the government to citizens could be a milestone aposgame-changerapos for the role of dogs in Chinese society, according to an animal welfare advocate. China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs conceded that dog meat remains a delicacy in many regions, but in a notice published on Wednesday they said dogs would no longer be considered as “livestock”. Chinaaposs ministry of agriculture said on Wednesday: As far as dogs are concerned, along with the progress of human civilisation and the public concern and love for animal protection, dogs have been specialised to become companion animals, and internationally are not considered to be livestock, and they will not be regulated as livestock in China. The draft guidelines have been opened for a public consultation, listing  traditional livestock species acceptable to the national government - many of them more family meat to the Western world. However the notice referred to  “special species” that would also be exempt from wild animal trading restrictions, including reindeer, alpaca, pheasants, ostriches and foxes.  Wendy Higgins, a spokeswoman for the animal welfare charity Humane Society International, said: The latest draft document could signal a critically important sht in China’s desire to see an end to the dog and cat meat trade. “Coming so soon after Shenzhen’s dog and cat meat ban, it is incredibly encouraging.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

If there is a way to do that I believe that is what everyone around the table would probably want.“It is whether we are going to get the opportunity to do that or not. Whether it is going to be possible remains to be seen.“It seems that with each passing week that is something which seems less likely to happen.“For all the clubs, whether it is Celtic or Dundee United, they will want to win the title properly.“Rangers will want to try to stop Celtic doing that.“Ourselves, Motherwell and other clubs are still fighting it out for European spots.“At the bottom end of the table it is also crucial.”Following an emergency meeting, the SPFL moved to table the resolution to their member clubs in light of the cabinet secretary for health announcing on March  NHS Scotland had been put on an emergency footing for at least  weeks until June .The SPFL also took into consideration the Scottish Government’s public advice that expectations are that restrictions could remain in place for at least  weeks.Their conclusion was the remaining fixtures in the three lower leagues and related play-off competitions cannot be scheduled without signicantly damaging the SPFL’s ability to start and complete, on time, the   league season and Betfred Cup.It is understood the deadline for votes is pm tomorrow with an announcement expected early next week on the outcome.McInnes said: “I think everyone would want the chance to play the season out and finish it properly. But whatever decisions are reached it is clearly going to upset some and not be favourable on all teams.”If voted through, the resolution would also confirm the relegation of Partick Thistle and Stranraer.There will also be no play-offs and the pyramid structure for promotion to the seniors would be scrapped this year.Should plans be approved the SPFL will consult with teams on reconfiguring the leagues for next season.SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster admitted the situation with the Premiership is “particularly complicated” – especially as UEFA recently threatened to strip European spots from any nation ending their season early. Belgium recently ended their campaign.Doncaster confirmed the SPFL are keen to work with UEFA and remain in discussion with Europe’s governing body regarding the situation in Scotland.McInnes said: “Hopefully we can have the opportunity to make sure we can still finish third and win a cup.“However, there is no doubt this is going to impact on all clubs in some shape or form.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/A64E600D-4D79-47C1-8B10-2526DFBB6FC1.jpg ","title":"aberdeens 1970 scottish cup winning squad where are they now","story":"Saturday marks  years to the day since Eddie Turnbull#s Aberdeen travelled to Hampden and won the Scottish Cup for the second time in the club#s history.To do so, the Reds overcame Celtic -.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

In short, you know exactly where you are with a doctor.This was very much the case with the former Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood when she helped deliver the Scottish Governments daily coronavirus updates alongside Nicola Sturgeon.Calm and assured, she rattled through the grim daily death toll with authority and when she appeared on our TV screens telling us all to stay indoors and save lives, the vast majority of us did because we didnt want to let her down or her colleagues.But then the illusion was shattered when she took a couple of weekends off with her family at their second home in the East Neuk of Fe.Worse still, she appeared to have misled the Scottish Government when she was caught by claiming she only went to check on the property, only to admit she had been there the previous weekend too.Hours later she had resigned, despite Ms Sturgeons best efforts to defend her and keep her expertise in the fold.The whole affair was a sorry saga with the only acceptable outcome reached.If she cant follow the rules then why should we  would have become a legitimate question with potentially fatal results.Hopefully the affair will not knock Nicola Sturgeon off her stride as she has been an impressive presence so far during the pandemic, as indeed have most politicians who have put bitter rivalry to one side for the greater good and long may that continue.The First Minister showed a particular touch of class when she sent her very best wishes to Boris Johnson and his family after he was admitted to intensive care after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.She added that the whole of Scotland was also willing him on as he begun his fight and she was right.

In the UK, an almost accidental referendum on EU membership with an unexpected victory for Leave another generationally signicant event. Around the world, the rise of populism and the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, a concept which seemed ridiculous and literally unbelievable until just before it actually happened.And now, of course, abruptly, coronavirus. An unknown death toll. A feared second wave. And a global economy in the bin, with perhaps decades-long consequences for public and domestic finances, and for the way that politics and economic works.I have omitted one other item of domestic signicance the five years of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the Opposition. When New Labour left office in , after a -year term which, ignoring the usual party political finger pointing, was at least perfectly competent, and which contained four events of historical signicance .There was no indication, at that point, that one more election defeat would provoke the knee-jerk reaction of having Mr Corbyn as leader. It is, by any standards, historically remarkable that the country has twice been asked to make its Prime Minister a man with what can most charitably be termed a controversial relationship with terrorists in Ireland and the Middle East, and with a litany of Communists dictators both to our east and to our west.Step in Sir Keir Starmer, elected as Mr Corbynrsquos replacement at the weekend. His election, I must concede, came as a pleasant surprise to me. I had presumed that the Labour party had been changed forever filled with Corbynistas and Momentum activists and destined to choose a Corbyn disciple as its leader.But just as Mr Blairrsquos changes were shown not to be permanent, so Mr Corbynrsquos seem to have been transient. The big question now, for the Labour party and for the country, is what does Sir Keir do  What Sir Keir do we get  And can Sir Keir reverse the damage done to our political discourse by those whom he has just defeated On that final point, it is easy to thinkthat the reversal can be instantaneous. Following a Skype call to Jewish leaders immediately after his election, Sir Keir won their praise for ldquoachieving in four days more than his predecessor in four years in addressing anti-Semitism in the Labour party.This was heartening. But will it materialise  After all, the promoters of anti-Semitism and other vitriol have not gone anywhere, at least not yet.In the push-back against anti-Semitism, as in many other areas, so much depends on the steeliness of Sir Keir himself. He has a career defining decision to make does he continue to pander to that element of his party, as he did during the leadership election in order to secure their votes, or does he reject them and ready himself to defeat them when they inevitably turn on him This fundamental decision, and Sir Keirrsquos preparedness to make dficult choices, will likely shape his leadership over the next five years, and with it his prospects of entering Downing Street at some point during .Should he forge his own path, he has the genesis of a radical  which could reshape the country in two fundamental ways. The first is the structure of the economy and, by implication, society.Coronavirus is certain to present governments all over the world with an economic problem countries experience only after a once-in-a-century event such as war or, in this case, pandemic. The UK Government is currently wielding the enormous power of the state, but continuing to do so as a method of facilitating the economic recovery is likely to be the road to ruin.Sir Keir would be well advised to reject outright his predecessorrsquos student socialism instead he could be better placed than anyone to reinvent capitalism for a post-coronavirus environment. He might choose to repurpose the philosophy of his social democratic background and look at how he may be able to use the private sector for a social purpose.How might private medicine, for instance, be used in partnership with the state to offer a better service to the public  How might the housebuilding sector be better aligned with the planning process to create the new homes that governments always talk about but never deliver  How might the large energy companies be utilised to create the domestic electric car charging network which governments accept we need but are probably too clumsy to deliver These are big concepts and big questions which Sir Keir needs to answerhe is to take on a Prime Minister who has, as a result of coronavirus, become a Tory who throws money around like confetti and lauds the power of state intervention, not to mention one who is currently enjoying massive approval ratings.The second fundamental change which Sir Keir has explicitly promoted relates to the UKrsquos constitutional structure. Federalism is a word to which everyone ascribes a dferent meaning, and it is far from clear what Sir Keirrsquos interpretation is.However, what everyone agrees on is that it sits somewhere in the middle of our constitutional status quo and independence. By simply positioning himself on that admittedly woolly ground, he positions himself in the same territory as most people in Scotland, as three-question polling has consistently shown.It will be up to Ian Murray, the reinstated Shadow Scottish Secretary who has forged a deserved reputation as a moderate and thoughtful force in the party, to put some much needed flesh on these bones.Mr Murrayrsquos consistent and clear opposition to Mr Corbyn has made him a figure of distaste for that side of his party. But in politics, the winner takes it all. And in creating a narrative for Sir Keirrsquos federalist agenda, Mr Murray will immediately move on to bigger things.Andy Maciver is Director of Message

enhance ldquocollective wellbeing and prosperity.It said Scotland continues to exhibit one of the most concentrated patterns of private land ownership in the world.The dominance of large-scale private owners has been associated with the loss of cultural ties between communities and the land, the quango said, as well as issues of insecurity, neglect, and disempowerment.This contrasts with the situation in some European countries, according to the SLC, where communities are often more ldquoculturally embedded in the land and more involved in land management.Its report examined a iety of international models, including in countries such as Kenya, Norway and Canada where land is owned or managed by indigenous people.Collective properties and commons, where land is owned and managed through co-operative business models, or where the rights of landowners are restricted, were also looked at.Elsewhere, the report explored municipal ownership and commonage, where local authorities own and manage land in the public interest, and where land is co-owned by the state and community with ying degrees of public input, such as in Norway, France, South Africa and Germany.Third sector and Community Land Trusts , where non-profit organisations own land with the primary aim of community benefit, such as in the US and England, were also analysed.The report said there is ldquoan opportunity to investigate further the potential application of the CLT model to deliver affordable housing in Scotland.It also argued municipal ownership ldquomay offer considerable potential, although Scotlandrsquos larger councils represent ldquoa key challenge for implementation.Hamish Trench, chief executive of the SLC, said the international research will help shape reform that works

Scotland.ldquoIt poses questions that go beyond the usual debate on land reform and ask us to think beyond the sectoral ides we sometimes assume are fixed.ldquoWe will be using this work to explore new governance models and I hope it will stimulate wider discussion and ideas.ldquoWe should be drawing on this international experience to shape reform that works for Scotland, reform that is designed to enhance our collective wellbeing and prosperity.Facilitating community ownership of land and assets is seen as a cornerstone of the current Scottish land reform agenda.Community bodies own just . per cent of Scotland.More than % of this is taken up by  large landholdings, as a result of the buyout of entire estates.Two-thirds of the Western Isles is under community ownership.The SLC said these acquisitions ldquohave been directly linked with far-reaching socioeconomic and environmental outcomes.These include increased investment, population retention, employment creation, community empowerment and sustainable land management.However, it added: ldquoDespite these positive impacts, communities engaging in acquisitions or those having acquired land and or assets often encounter a wide range of challenges.ldquoThese include: legislative and administrative hurdles limited funding availabilityobstructive landowners ensuring economic viability of the asset landholding ision and conflict in the community and limited community capacity.The SLC said there is a ldquounique approach to land reform in Scotland, adding: ldquoThe focus is on the expansion of community ownership, as opposed to increasing public or private ownership, in ways that deliver benefits for communities, as is the case in many other

It can be harmful to lambs, calves and other animals and wildle too.But for farmers and other landowners, it is also costly to clean up.ldquoDealing with litter and flytipping costs an eye watering pound million of public money in Scotland every year, and thatrsquos only in relation to public land.ldquoThis money could be better spent where, particularly at this time.ldquoWhen litter and flytipping occurs on private land such as farmersrsquo fields, it is down to the owner to have it removed ndash and to foot the bill for doing so. The costs involved are huge.ldquoThe effects are not all financial either. Flytipping takes time to clear responsibly, can block access, and can cause issues around health and safety.ldquoThe public can also help by acting as the eyes and ears of their community - we urge anyone who notices flytipping to report it, so it can be dealt with by the appropriate authority.ldquoThis can be done in a number of ways, including through the online Dumb Dumpers website or reporting directly to the relevant local authority.ldquoAs rural and environmental organisations, we are working together to stop flytipping ndash but we can only do it with the publicrsquos support.The joint statement was signed by Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates NFUS president Andrew McCornick Alan Dron, rural crime coordinator at the Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime Barry Fisher, chief executive of Keep Scotland Beautul and Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland.The plea comes amid reports of a surge in flytipping across the UK.Residents have been urged to act responsibly as councils suspend normal services such as household waste centres to cope with the Covid- pandemic.There have also been concerns over an increase in waste as families spend more time at home and stock up on supplies.Councils across Scotland have scaled-back services.The collection of bulky waste has been suspended at Glasgow City Council since March .It urges residents not to leave items on the street. Its website adds: ldquoPlease leave any unwanted items safely on your own property such as your back garden or your back court and remain mindful of any fire risk.All household waste recycling centres are closed until further notice.Edinburgh has also suspended the collection of bulky waste, and advises residents: ldquoIf you have large items please keep them at home and only use communal and wheelie bins for your day to day waste and recycling.The cityrsquos recycling centres are also closed until further notice.Mavis Valley Recycling Centre in East Dunbartonshire has been closed since March , while household waste recycling centres in West Lothian were shut on the same date.In West Dunbartonshire, the recycling centres at Ferry Road and Dalmoak are closed until further notice.Similar measures have been put in place at councils up and down the country.Mark Ruskell MSP, the Scottish Greensrsquo farming spokesman, said flytippers are putting others at risk.He said: ldquoFlytipping is illegal and dangerous at any time, but at a time of national emergency it is a downright disgrace. Emergency regulations state that people must stay at home unless they have an essential reason to be out.ldquoThose perpetrating this anti-social practice are not only breaching these regulations but they are putting others at risk, potentially spreading the virus while doing so.ldquoIrsquod urge anyone with information on anyone engaging in this irresponsible activity to report it to police and local authorities immediately.Scottish Conservative rural affairs spokeswoman Rachael Hamilton MSP said: ldquoThe country is going through an unprecedented crisis and farmers are doing their best to keep the food and drink supplies coming.ldquoThe very least they deserve is to be repaid by increased fly-tipping.ldquoFlytipping is dangerous to livestock and hazardous for farm workers to clear-up.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3063615.jpg--.jpg?1586252028000\n","title":"advice for consumers as major retailer appoints administrators","story":" The news that Debenhams have announced plans to enter administration may have left many of their customers in the Ballymena area who have gt vouchers wondering what their rights are.Debenhams, which has a Ballymena outlet, announced that it will file for administration for the second time in a year.John French, Chief Executive of The Consumer Council said: “At the moment Debenhams is still accepting gt vouchers online but this may change.

It has done what relationships gurus couldn#t trythey were asked to. It has definitely repaired many a family squabbles bringing tranquility I would imagine where there was no possibility for that. Businesses, places of worship, schools, restaurants and pubs are all closed sad, yes, but the cumulative effect of the lockdown is the peace it has brought in homes. vw, px\"  TAILOR-MADE: Absence makes the heart grow fonder # Elly OdhiamboThat is my experience: fewer silly arguments about whose turn it to wash the dishes and get the food ready for the household. The shutdown is magical albeit an emotionally draining one. I had to talk to my landlord from across the street so that we don’t infect each other with this virus that has caused the shutdown. I have heard of families avoiding each other within the house in order to stay clean of the dreaded disease.The shutdown is non-discriminatory because its basic effects to you and me will probably be equal. It does not target this or that race, gender, height measurement and so forth, we have seen reports that little children ill with the disease are dying. So people need to stay home.Thee other day I was thinking about back home, Kenya – the dferent urban and rural settings where I grew up and the things that I am missing. For example, a slimy vegetable called apoth. This vegetable is heaven on earth especially after it has been left in the pot matured for days with some milk. You will regret ever becoming a fan of meat. So once you’ve cooked your ring aliya, a special sun-dried beef, and got your four-stars chilli pepper, you get your maize flour ugali meal ready. These are some of the things we miss.MISSING IN ACTIONThe plan was to fly back home this summer after being missing in action there since . Shock, horror! Not really, because I know of people who sadly haven’t been home for a very y period of time. A Zimbabwean told me seventeen years and counting.Eleven siblings meeting under one roof has never happened in our household since around the same time the Cold War ended in , or thereabouts. This was without a doubt the last time I saw all eleven of us packed in one room in the small lakeside town of Homa Bay. Our mother was a tailor, still is at the age of . She had the natural talent for making women’s cloths only. If she was going to cross that line and do outfits for males, it was for boys – her children. Her shop sounded elitist, Mama Vicky’s Boutique, but it was a normal place on an earthen, untarmacked road – what Belfast would call ghe High Street. Those were the days I tell you. Iniduals and families could afford buying new tailored clothes because the structural adjustment policies of the financial world had not yet hit our African economies. In simple words there was disposable money floating about even in countries without social security systems but people could afford basics.The cotton industry in African countries was still strong. I remember we used to pick cotton, bale it up and drive it to the local ginnery for cash. That cotton was not exported, it stayed in Kenya for the Kenyan market. Mama Vicky’s Boutique was a smaller version of the shirt factories that littered Ireland and made women the bosses of their household – correct me thereI am wrong.DILEMMA OF INHERITANCEThese unique places that kept the Irish and British economies going started shutting down . The women and male tailors in Kenya were generally not employed in big manufacturing textile mills, there were only about six such places in the country. But the feeling was the same when the garment industry faced closure. Jobs were lost and people could not sustain their livelihoods. In Africa many people had to turn to farming the smallholder units. Families rely heavily on rural inheritance, so the land favours the boys in the family and less so the girls as once they are married off, the women have to go to live in their husband’s home, hence the dilemma of inheritance. It is discriminatory against women and the laws have changed in many African countries, hopefully for the better.One day, with her permission of course, I will tell you why my mother prefers making women’s clothes.Elly O Odhiambo is a freelance writer living in West Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"we could be heroes","story":"All has changed in Belfast in the space of a short few days.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s been an extremely strange time, he says. For the guts of three weeks now I#ve barely been out of the house. The one exception was at the weekend when my we and I drove over to my daughter#s house nearby to look through the window at three of our seven grandchildren.You see, we have a new grandson who is three weeks old so we were able to take a look at him through the glass, evenwe couldn#t hold him.The coronavirus situation has had a huge impact on us, like it has on everyone . In a way I feel like we#re very lucky because we#re out in the country and we have plenty of room in the garden to get out and get a bit of air.Some days I feel asI#m competing to have the best mown lawn in the country, I#m tidying it up that much. We#ll be able to play golf on it before long. And I#m doing wee quirky things too, like a bit more cooking and bingeing on box sets.But it has been dficult too. For  years I#ve run a business, a factory  yards from my house where we create bespoke kitchens and furniture. We have  employees. So for  years that#s been my lestyle.I#ve been up and about, in and out of my work and the house from .am until pm in the evening, or later, but we furloughed the business on March , the day after the lockdown came into effect.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdown FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdownIt was a very upsetting thing to do, especially thinking about all the people we had to send home from their jobs.It#s the biggest call I can remember making in all that time but I think it was the right thing to do to protect us all for when we come out of this thing.I#m in a high-risk category for Covid- because I#ve got a heart condition, which was detected quite recently.I was due to have a procedure soon to deal with it, but because of everything that#s going on it#s been cancelled for now.I decided to isolate myself even before the government lockdown, so I haven#t been into Newry in more than two weeks, which is very strange.Normally I#d be in and out of the town at least once or twice a day, so I am feeling the effect of this in a big way. I#m in the house on my own quite a bit because my we is carrying on going to her work in the hospital.It#s strange to have my routine completely knocked on the head.From days when I#d be so busy morning to night with people milling around all the time in and out of the factory, it#s become very quiet and there#s a lot less activity going on.I#m doing some work in the house on my laptop, bits of admin and keeping in touch with my son who also works in the business.But compared to what it was, it#s very dferent. My we and I were supposed to be going to New York with our daughter and son-in-law a few days before St Patrick#s Day, but we cancelled. I#m relieved we did because the situation over there seems to be dire, and at least we avoided getting caught up in it or bringing it back home with us.The thing about it all is that, while it#s strange and dficult to adjust to, I think it will have a lasting impact. It#s definitely made me sit up and think what was all the rushing about for. If we#re lucky to come through it all then maybe it#s time to have a look at it and change our perspectives a bit.As well as my we working in the NHS, my daughter is a consultant up in the Royal in Belfast, so it#s a worrying time. It#s certainly made me sit back and take stock.We don#t really need the foreign holidays or to be so busy in our lives all the time. What we actually need is to slow down and realise what matters - our families, our health, a good quality of le in our local areas.It#s been a huge wake-up call and a huge chance to make some serious changes when this very dficult situation comes to an end.‘Living in a fth floor flat, we feel trapped.

It#s been hard for all of us, and especially because I#d be classed as a high-risk person. I had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, and while I#m about to hit four years clear it won#t be until the five-year mark that I#ll be able to feel truly confident.My immune system took a real knock through the treatment so when everything started to become more serious with the coronavirus outbreak we knew it was going to be major.When you have cancer, you learn to take every day as it comes and try to avoid going down the road of stressing about everything because it really doesn#t help.Living in the high-rises at the minute really isn#t easy. Daisy and I don#t get out - except that I get to leave the flat to do some volunteering at the Dunanney Centre to help other people in the Rathcoole community. But other than that, Daisy and I are pretty much stuck inside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaisy looks out the window FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaisy looks out the windowDave is a key worker so he#s carried on as he works in distribution for animal feed. He#s the only one of us really going anywhere.We have three bedrooms in the flat, with a separate bathroom and toilet, a living room and a kitchen.It#s quite good in size compared to what some other people have, but being trapped inside all the time makes you realise just how small it is. We don#t have a garden to open the back door into. We don#t have a balcony, and our windows have latches on them so they only open a very small crack.You can take the latches offyou need to, but for now with Daisy so young I don#t even want to go there, so we keep the latches on. I keep the blinds pulled right back so any sunshine there is can get in, and the windows are open a crack for some air, but that#s it really. It will be hard as the weather gets nicer.There are communal areas outside, and we have communal lts to get you down there. Butwe do that then we#re running the risk of being in close contact with other people, and none of us know who may have symptoms or could have been exposed to this.Not getting out into the fresh air is very dficult. I suppose it#s getting me down a bit, and the longer it goes on the more I#m feeling a bit anxious. But I know it#s the right thing to do. Luckily Daisy has taken it really well. She#s not at the point where she#s tearing her hair out wanting to get outside. She misses the park and getting to school with her friends, but she#s been really understanding and accepting of the situation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJillian with husband Dave FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJillian with husband DaveHer school was great in explaining a bit about the coronavirus so she knows we#re inside to stay safe and that it won#t last forever.What I#m desperate for is to be able to take Daisy to the park. Normally we stop off on the way home from school so she can have a run about for  minutes before we go home to do her homework, but now everything is limited to inside.We#re still doing some exercise. She really enjoys dancing and we put music on and she makes up dances and practices her cartwheels. I#ve got my stepper on my phone, and we go walking around between rooms to get our steps up.It#s actually been fine because we#re just doing our best to fill our days, and be flexible with it. I think trying to impose a strict timetable on ourselves just wouldn#t work, because this just isn#t a normal time.Our usual routine is completely gone. I don#t work, but I volunteer in the community as a Listening Ear and at other groups, and between that and school as well as Daisy#s Girls# Brigade we usually have a lot to keep ourselves busy.For now though we#re just trying our best, like everyone . When Dave is off he#s doing wee cookery classes with Daisy, and as well as that we#re trying to do a bit of school work every day because she#s always really enjoyed learning. I don#t want that to be something she loses because of all this.The next thing to think about is Daisy#s birthday, which is later this month, a couple of days after mine. We#ve told her she#s going to be like the Queen, with two birthdays in .She#ll have a small one at home with me and her daddy and then a lovely big one later on when all of this stuff comes to an end.

Rishi Sunak confirmed that charities, including those supporting domestic abuse victims and hospices, would receive cash grants to ensure they can meet increased demand as a result of the virus. Some £million from government departments will go to charities providing key services, while smaller ones will benefit from £million, including through a grant to the National Lottery Community Fund. Welcoming the news, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: I am delighted to announce that Northern Ireland charities will receive at least £million under the Barnett formula as part of the multimillion-pound package of coronavirus funding unveiled by the Chancellor today. I encourage the Executive to use this funding to support vital organisations as they continue to provide key services at the heart of local communities during this challenging time.The charity sector delivers key support to the most vulnerable in our society, and this initiative will help to ensure that they can continue to assist those who are most in need.The Government has also pledged to match the public#s donations to the National Emergencies Trust, guaranteeing a minimum of £million. It will match whatever the public decides to donate to the BBC#s Big Night In charity appeal on April . Mr Sunak said: Our charities are playing a crucial role in the national fight against coronavirus, supporting those who are most in need. It#s right we do everything we can to help the sector during this dficult time, which is why we have announced this unprecedented £million package of extra funding. This will ensure our key charities can continue to deliver the services that millions of people rely on. Tens of thousands of charities are expected to benefit, including hospices, St John#s Ambulance, vulnerable children and victims services and Citizen#s Advice.Announcing the funds for frontline charities at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak said: For them, shutting up shop at this moment would be to contravene their very purpose, their entire reason to exist. Those charities have never been more needed than they are now, and they have never faced such a sudden fall in their funding. At this time, when many are hurting and tired and confined, we need the gentleness of charities in our lives. It gives us hope, it makes us stronger and it reminds us we depend on each other. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was delighted that up to £m would go towards hospices. Mr Hancock added: Hospices have suffered a huge challenge to their funding due to the outbreak of coronavirus, but at the same time they have continued to play a vital role in delivering compassionate, quality end-of-le care for many people.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralDon#t take Lisburn anti-NHS graffiti personally, MLA Butler urges health workersMotorcyclist who died in Armagh crash had become dad for first timeNewry man blackmailed scores of kids into performing sex acts, court toldEssex lorry deaths: Northern Ireland driver Mo Robinson admits manslaughter of  people,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

vulnerable children and children of key workers across Northern Ireland.He said the number of parents using the service was relatively low, with between  and , children attending the schools.Around Â£ million has been provided for Emergency Childcare provision for key workers as part of new proposals to help support vulnerable children and the children of key workers @healthdpt https:t.co LEviQiq

there were  children still looking for a place at a school, but expressed confidence they would be placed “very soon”.Mr Weir told committee members that all staff teachers and non-teaching staff would continue to be paid through the emergency.He said there was a proposal for a hardship fund for substitute teachers whose regular work has now ended as a result of Covid-, but he said that initiative would be dependent on additional funding from the Department of Finance.The minister appeared before the committee as his department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, launched a new £ million support package to ensure emergency childcare was also available to key workers.It will see the provision of a home childcare scheme and financial support for closed daycare facilities to reopen to look after vulnerable children and the children of key workers.Every contribution that every school is making is making a dferencePeter WeirThe minister told the committee the schools and teachers had stepped up to the mark to help deal with the crisis.“The important thing is that when we reach the surge we are not seeing a key worker being denied that opportunity, and I have been taken by the number of schools that are staying open where perhaps in terms of their local school community there is perhaps only one child or one or two key workers that are being facilitated, but that school has felt it to be absolutely worthwhile still to be open for that.“Every contribution that every school is making is making a dference, and we don’t know, that one inidual could make the dference between somebody’s le or somebody’s death.”He added: “The extent to which schools have stepped up to the mark to provide that service I think is an exemplary to our society.”Announcing the childcare measures, Mr Weir said: “Our starting position remains unchanged, where it is possible to do so, children should be cared for in their own homes.“Schools, pre-school education settings, registered daycare facilities and childminders should only be providing care for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b

Well, it came from China, but you know what I mean! Our world as we know it has changed, but not forever… It is horrible for families in isolation as they cannot visit friends, family, or play sports. The elderly are alone and afraid with only doorstep conversations . People are getting sick and this virus is taking control! For me personally, I hate this thing and what it’s doing. I miss my friends, I miss my cousins and I especially miss my grandparents. My Granny Jean is  tomorrow and I can’t even visit her. Mummy and me are making a cakefor her but there will be no party – for now. googletag.cmd.push I also miss my football matches and trips to the club to watch my brothers play. The club is locked up now when it should be packed with football and camogie every night. I can’t wait for it to reopen. I’m daydreaming about trips to the beach, the cinema, the restaurants in Belfast and even our next holiday to Portugal. The endless days at home are giving me cabin fever – the war on WiFi here is endless! Then there is the handwashing… I really miss the classroom. My teacher, Mrs McLea, uploads voice messages of morning prayer and greetings to us every morning and I look forward to that as we all get a chance to say something to each other. googletag.cmd.push I really hope Covid- disappears soon so I can get back to St Mary’s for my final days there in P. We had so much planned…school trips, leavers’ mass, Confirmation. Our plans have changed now and it’s just such a shame. Wouldn’t it be great not to have to worry about Covid- anymore and just have our old le back! It is dficult to see any positives with this situation but we should look on the bright side of these times. Global warming has been reduced because not many people are going out in their cars and high pollution factories have been on lockdown too. Our planet is getting a well-earned rest! We are all getting a break or a rest as we’re not rushing anywhere! I am spending more time with my brothers - evenit is to get a haircut in the kitchen with Luke’s new hair clippers. Not getting up until I actually waken is nice. I am enjoying baking and cooking with mammy – I am getting good at it! We say an Our Father together at am every day for those with the virus to recover and for the NHS staff . I am grateful at least for the Xbox. I can still chat and stay connected with friends online . I love watching films with Daddy as it is normally only Christmas we get the chance to do that so much. Sometimes it feels like we are on holidays, especiallyit’s a late Netflix! There is the odd darts, pool and poker competition at home now – that should cover the maths home schooling surely ! I suppose with the weather improving we can always go outside more. The trampoline is back in use and I’ll practise my football – maybe my left foot! I hope Covid- will go away forever and when the world s to normal, what a better world it will be. I think we will all have learned new skills and how to make the best of a bad time. We’ll be so thankful and appreciate everything and everyone even more!

Thats the view of Newbridge manager Killian Conlan, who also acknowledges the importance needing to be placed on safely managing the current Covid- pandemic that has brought the sporting calendar to a standstill. Conlan, who also coaches the Ballinderry U team, speaks of the strange scenario of going from being busy to being left looking at sport from the outside. “It is coming up on four weeks this Thursday. We had training scheduled and the first competitive game in the Larkin Cup,” he said in an interview with the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push Conlan, a coach under Damian McErlain at minor and senior level, said it was great to see all the youngsters across the country honing their skills and uploading them on social media. But at senior level, preparations are much dferent. The Newbridge squad have also been using technology to keep in shape, with the help of player Nathan Rocks, who has a background in Strength and Conditioning. “He runs an online workout for the players and they do a bit of road-running,” said Conlan, who is cautious of the implications of pounding the roads. “You need to be cautious, with players having knee and Achilles problems in the past. Some players dont like using treadmills and we cant use the pitch with the gates being closed.” googletag.cmd.push Team management is a balancing act, Conlan points out. Players have dferent types of fitness equipment at home, the squad has a range of ages and fitness levels. “It is really marrying that all together and watching what they eat. But it is important they are not worrying about it too much and they have this time to spend with their families,” Conlan adds. He is also aware of the mental health aspect of the lay-off. Gone is the interaction of meeting up three days a week. Like many clubs, the Bridge  has many family links and players are having to refrain from entering each others houses. “We have to look at the bigger picture here, the more we can do then the quicker this whole scenario can leave us and we can move on,” Derry are due to play Armagh in the Ulster SFC on Saturday, May . As yet, no decision has been made on the next step. The games involving London and New York have been pulled due to the travel plans involved. “It is a dficult job for them , but they are probably soon going to have to make a call on what they are going to do,” Conlan added. “After the league, counties usually have a month to prepare for championship. Whatever date they decide to go back to,they ever do, they will have to allow for teams to prepare. It is going to be very hard for an entire  of players to prepare for a game they didnt know was going to happen.” It will knock on to a club fixture calendar Conlan says is stretched already. “I can see the league maybe being cancelled and used as warm-up games before playing a club championship in the autumn. Thats just my thinking and what other people are thinking, but we dont know. “When clubs started, the Derry CCC were excellent with their communication. You had a certain time limit to put forward dates for weddings and stag dos. Youd imagine that has all been shelved. All of a sudden, new fixtures could be released and they dont suit.” With sporting teams all over the world uncertain of what is around the corner, Conlan puts things in perspective. “In the grander scheme of things, it is insignicant when you think about the battles and the real le scenarios that are happening in the hospitals at the moment. To me that is more important. “It has been great the way the GAA has came together, with each club – with help from the Official GAA – to having dferent contacts in dferent communities for the elderly and vulnerable to call on for help and deliveries.” RELATED - GAA suspend all activities.

Thats the view of Newbridge manager Killian Conlan, who also acknowledges the importance needing to be placed on safely managing the current Covid- pandemic that has brought the sporting calendar to a standstill. Conlan, who also coaches the Ballinderry U team, speaks of the strange scenario of going from being busy to being left looking at sport from the outside. “It is coming up on four weeks this Thursday. We had training scheduled and the first competitive game in the Larkin Cup,” he said in an interview with the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push Conlan, a coach under Damian McErlain at minor and senior level, said it was great to see all the youngsters across the country honing their skills and uploading them on social media. But at senior level, preparations are much dferent. The Newbridge squad have also been using technology to keep in shape, with the help of player Nathan Rocks, who has a background in Strength and Conditioning. “He runs an online workout for the players and they do a bit of road-running,” said Conlan, who is cautious of the implications of pounding the roads. “You need to be cautious, with players having knee and Achilles problems in the past. Some players dont like using treadmills and we cant use the pitch with the gates being closed.” googletag.cmd.push Team management is a balancing act, Conlan points out. Players have dferent types of fitness equipment at home, the squad has a range of ages and fitness levels. “It is really marrying that all together and watching what they eat. But it is important they are not worrying about it too much and they have this time to spend with their families,” Conlan adds. He is also aware of the mental health aspect of the lay-off. Gone is the interaction of meeting up three days a week. Like many clubs, the Bridge  has many family links and players are having to refrain from entering each others houses. “We have to look at the bigger picture here, the more we can do then the quicker this whole scenario can leave us and we can move on,” Derry are due to play Armagh in the Ulster SFC on Saturday, May . As yet, no decision has been made on the next step. The games involving London and New York have been pulled due to the travel plans involved. “It is a dficult job for them , but they are probably soon going to have to make a call on what they are going to do,” Conlan added. “After the league, counties usually have a month to prepare for championship. Whatever date they decide to go back to,they ever do, they will have to allow for teams to prepare. It is going to be very hard for an entire  of players to prepare for a game they didnt know was going to happen.” It will knock on to a club fixture calendar Conlan says is stretched already. “I can see the league maybe being cancelled and used as warm-up games before playing a club championship in the autumn. Thats just my thinking and what other people are thinking, but we dont know. “When clubs started, the Derry CCC were excellent with their communication. You had a certain time limit to put forward dates for weddings and stag dos. Youd imagine that has all been shelved. All of a sudden, new fixtures could be released and they dont suit.” With sporting teams all over the world uncertain of what is around the corner, Conlan puts things in perspective. “In the grander scheme of things, it is insignicant when you think about the battles and the real le scenarios that are happening in the hospitals at the moment. To me that is more important. “It has been great the way the GAA has came together, with each club – with help from the Official GAA – to having dferent contacts in dferent communities for the elderly and vulnerable to call on for help and deliveries.” RELATED - GAA suspend all activities.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion.

There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally.

In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally.

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort. As a result, the -year-old, who is currently studying to become a teacher, has offered to do a sketch of anyone who passes away from the virus. He has already been contacted by one family and within days of the person passing away, Aodhan had left the drawing at their home. He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort. As a result, the -year-old, who is currently studying to become a teacher, has offered to do a sketch of anyone who passes away from the virus. He has already been contacted by one family and within days of the person passing away, Aodhan had left the drawing at their home. He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all. If you can, embrace the cotton wool,only for a while..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Workload.jpg","title":"Workload up for Good Morning Down staff  ","story":"THE Good Morning Down charity which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district has increased the number of calls it makes as the coronavirus takes hold.Volunteers who work for highly acclaimed charity mdash now in its th year mdash have relocated from the organisationrsquos base at the Down Business Park in Downpatrick to their homes to ensure that the friendly voices people have come to rely on continue to be heard.Good Morning Down has also confirmed that in addition to increasing the number of calls that it makes, it has moved some people off the servicersquos waiting list in order that they can receive a call at this worrying time.Since it launch in , Good Morning Down has supported over  people with a wide range of disabilities and needs and the service it provides to people who live alone has never been more important.While there is concern among the senior citizens they contact and who have been advised to remain in doors for the foreseeable future, there is also great stoicism, with several able to recall hardships that they had to endure during World War Two.Staffed by  volunteers, the charity normally makes around  calls between Monday and Friday but the number has increased to help reassure elderly and vulnerable people that they are not alone.Relocating staff away from their main hub at Innovation House, the charity is unable to pick up any messages that may be left on the Good Morning Down answering machine.

In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18336029.primary-school-pupils-bring-cheer-elderly-isolation/resources/images/11245101.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And he stressedthat those flouting public health advice have no right joining in the weekly applause for care workers. “Please don’t be tempted into letting down your guard over Easter. Our health and social care staff are relying on us all to keep doing the right thing. “The weekly Thursday night applause is so important and heartening, but it is not sufficient by itself. We have to keep following the social distancing restrictions. The vast majority of people are doing so, and I thank them for it. “But I am urging the small majority ignoring the restrictions to think again for the sake of themselves and their loved ones. Don’t be a hypocrite tonight by applauding care workers and then letting them down by your actions.” Mr Swann added: “The social distancing measures will stay in place for as long as they are needed and will be strengthened furtherrequired. “They are starting to make an impact. However, it is still early days and there will be many dficult weeks and months ahead.” The Minister concluded: “As we head into the Easter weekend, the message remains the same. Stay at home - do not go out unless it’s absolutely necessary. Keep your distanceyou do have to leave your home. Keep washing your hands and keep fighting back against COVID-.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_ebaabdbbdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_acceebedbaebbfdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3069224.jpg--.jpg?1586430164000\\","title":"poilce stay at home this easter ","story":"With the sun continuing to shine and a stretch in the evenings, it may be tempting to leave the house to celebrate Easter this weekend - but the PSNI Chief Constable, Simon Byrne, requests that you stay at home to save lives.Whether it is investigating murder or searching for missing people – amid the current challenges of Covid- – your Police Service continues to work hard to keep communities safe, he said.We can only do our jobs with your support, particularly when it comes to staying at home and listening to the advice from the Government and health professionals.Easter weekend is one that traditionally many people look forward to enjoying with friends and family. There’s a stretch in the evenings and the weather’s better – but please don’t be tempted to head to parks and beaches. Now isn’t the right time – you need to follow the rules that have been put in place. What we do now can help slow the virus – and we all have our part to play in that.You should only be leaving home for a number of key reasons – these include getting food and basic supplies, seeking medical assistance and taking exercise close to your home. Please – do not get into your car and travel excessively for exercise. Thank you to the vast majority of people who have been complying with this.Our policing approach continues to be that we will engage with iniduals and communities explaining what we require them to do and encouraging them to change their behaviour to reduce the spread of the virus. We will only use enforcement when it is absolutely necessary –people are not listening and putting lives at risk. For the small numbers of people who are continuing to ignore the restrictions it is inevitable that we will have to move to enforcement through the issue of penalty notices.Our job as police officers is to keep communities safe - and that’s what we want to do now, in these unprecedented times, just as we have always done.Please help us to support our health service to jointly fight the spread of the virus.Stay home stay safe save lives.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_fecfcbbdbebeef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n n n n n bannerbox_cbaecceeeeaac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
