At least one of the singer\u0027s attorneys says he urged her repeatedly over the years to draft one.\u0027I tried to convince her that she should do not just a will but a trust while she was still alive,\u0027 says Don Wilson, a Los Angeles lawyer who worked on entertainment matters for Franklin for nearly 30 years. \u0027She never told me, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do one.\u0027 She understood the need. It just didn\u0027t seem to be something she got around to.\u0027Laura Zwicker, an attorney who specializes in estate planning but is not affiliated with the Franklin estate, says she sees it happen all too often in her work.\u0027People don\u0027t like to face their own mortality,\u0027 Zwicker says. \u0027I had a client who had a $70 million real estate portfolio who had had end-stage diabetes. He had plenty of conversations with me about estate planning but would not sign the documents.\u0027  She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin (pictured), Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardianPapers filed in Michigan\u0027s Oakland County court last week by David J. Bennett, the lawyer who worked most closely with Franklin, lay out the few known basics:She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin, Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardian. And a niece of hers has accepted the role of executor.  Family members embrace at Franklin\u0027s funeral. A niece of hers has accepted the role of executor Under Michigan law, as in most states, the sons will equally ide their mother\u0027s assets in the absence of a will, and so far no signs of conflict have emerged among family members. Bennett did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.Aretha Franklin\u0027s friend Ron Moten, a Michigan businessman, gave the four sons some guidance in his speech at Friday\u0027s funeral.\u0027Remember your family, and friends that have been with you for years,\u0027 Moten told the men. \u0027Because you are about to meet a lot of people who will now want to be your new best friend. You will also meet some people that will have the best investments in the world for you. My advice? Go slow, be careful and be smart.\u0027The documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estate. The figure almost certainly runs into the tens of millions, but there will probably be widely varying estimates as her attorneys seek to downplay her wealth for tax purposes and the IRS tries to maximize the amount for its own reasons.Franklin maintained ownership of the songs she wrote and did well by them, Wilson says, though of her major hits, \u0027Think\u0027 is the only one that\u0027s her own composition. She also wrote some lesser hits, such as \u0027Rock Steady.\u0027  Jordan Franklin, left, pauses alongside his sister Victorie Franklin while speaking about their grandmother, Aretha Franklin. Documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estateThough her records were played millions of times, she earned little in radio royalties from smashes like 1967\u0027s \u0027Respect\u0027 because such payments go overwhelmingly to the song\u0027s author, not the performer. In the case of \u0027Respect,\u0027 the royalties go to the estate of Otis Redding, even though the song owes nearly all its popularity to Franklin.\u0027I would imagine she probably felt she was entitled to more, but probably received more than a lot of artists from the time, especially African-American artists,\u0027 Wilson says.Among Franklin\u0027s more tangible assets are several pieces of property in the Detroit area that according to tax assessors\u0027 estimates are worth at least $2 million, with a market value that could easily be twice that.Star of Marvel\u0027s Luke Cage apologizes after appearing to...Bill Clinton is VERY impressed with mini-dress wearing...Share this article    Some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent   \u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 lawyer Laura Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent\u0027Once the value is established - a process that could take years - the IRS will take any back taxes Franklin owed, then will tax her estate at 40 percent for any assets beyond $11.2 million.Kenneth Abdo, an attorney who specializes in probate law and has worked on the estate of Prince, who also died without a will, says the IRS will conduct an audit of her holdings.Wilson, her entertainment attorney, says she would not have wanted to see her finances publicly aired: \u0027She was a private person.\u0027As for why some clients don\u0027t make out a will, Zwicker said some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent.\u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/17/4F9AF2F000000578-6121967-image-a-2_1535820175512.jpg","title":"Obama never tried hide admiration John McCain","story":"    Former President Barack Obama delivered a touching eulogy to Republican Senator John McCain on Saturday (pictured)          The pair were pitted against each other for the Presidency in 2008 (pictured in 2008)  and while Obama won the race, the pair quickly sat down to decide how they would work together\u0027We come to celebrate an extraordinary man.

To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and a betrayal of that trust.’Mr Johnson’s popularity among Tory Party members has soared since he resigned as Foreign Secretary in July in protest at Mrs May’s Chequers plan, which would see the UK agreeing to follow EU regulations on trade, the environment and social affairs. He said it left the country at risk of ‘economic vassalage’ and accused Mrs May of ‘dithering’ over the UK’s strategy.Momentum founder who propelled Jeremy Corbyn to leadership...Raab insists a Brexit deal is \u0027within our reach\u0027 after new...Share this articleMeanwhile, Mrs May’s allies say that executives working for Sir Lynton’s powerful campaign company, CTF Partners, have been in discussions to ‘put rocket boosters’ under Change Britain, a group set up to argue for a hard Brexit, and turn it into a guerilla campaign against the Chequers deal.They fear that the group will mount rallies around the country headed by Mr Johnson and other high-profile Brexiteers. Change Britain has strong links with the influential European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.Mrs May’s allies believe that Sir Lynton’s outfit has been targeting Eurosceptic Tory donors to fund the campaign.They are also suspicious that Mr Jonson seems to have been ‘singing from the Lynton hymn sheet’ since his resignation – and point to the furore over Mr Johnson’s inflammatory claim that burkas make women look like ‘bank robbers’ or ‘letterboxes’. Sir Lynton, 62, is an exponent of so-called ‘dog-whistle politics’, in which controversial messages, couched in relatively inoffensive language, are targeted at the Hard-Right.          The Prime Minister (pictured in Cape Town) last night vowed not to make any compromises to the Chequers deal, nor to ‘give in’ to demands for a second referendum Sir Lynton, dubbed the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for his previous successes, lost some of his lustre after playing a key role in the disastrous 2017 Election campaign which led to the loss of Mrs May’s Commons majority.The row comes as MPs return to the Commons after the summer recess to prepare for a series of bruising battles over Brexit, with Mrs May hoping to strike a final deal with the EU within the next two months and then win Parliament’s approval. But she faces opposition from dozens of Tory MPs in the ERG, who share Mr Johnson’s objections to the Chequers deal.It has led to intense speculation among MPs that if Mrs May tries to force Chequers through, then the ERG would force a vote of no confidence in her. If 48 MPs make such a call, then a vote would be held, triggering a leadership contest if Mrs May lost.A source close to Mr Johnson said: ‘Boris has always backed the aims of Change Britain but he has no role in the organisation.’A spokesman for CTF said that while Sir Lynton had not personally ‘spoken with nor met anyone from Change Britain’, the company’s senior staff ‘were often consulted because of their campaign expertise and knowledge’.He added: ‘The better the deal the Prime Minister secures in Brexit, the better the prospects for the Conservatives at the next Election.’   SIMON WALTERS: Revenge of \u0027Wizard of Oz\u0027 Sir Lynton Crosby blamed for Theresa May\u0027s election humiliationThe feud between Sir Lynton Crosby and Theresa May dates back to her disastrous decision to call a snap election in June 2017.Both are said to blame each other for the fiasco.When Australian-born Crosby first heard of the snap poll from a May aide, he was in Fiji at a family gathering and his stunned response was: ‘I’m not sure that’s a smart idea, mate.’The Mail on Sunday revealed last year how he sent Mrs May a ‘killer memo’ warning her it could backfire. He said there was ‘a lot of risk’ in calling a surprise ballot: voters were desperate to ‘avoid uncertainty’– but by going to the polls, she was doing the opposite.Instead of the landslide win she expected, she could do no better than David Cameron’s narrow win in 2015, Crosby advised. In the event she did worse, and lost her Commons majority.For their part, Mrs May’s supporters said she blamed him for key campaign mistakes.They blamed Crosby for ordering her to run a presidential style ‘strong and stable’ campaign which collapsed days after the manifesto launch when she was forced to tear up plans for a so-called ‘dementia tax.’ Sir Lynton also fell out with Mrs May’s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, with Timothy subsequently accusing him of failing to spot Jeremy Corbyn’s support among young voters.          Theresa May and election guru Lynton Crosby, pictured, are said to blame each other for the Conservatives\u0027 failure to win a majority at the snap election in June 2017Tough-talking Crosby is known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’ because of his record of election campaign successes.He helped Right-wing Australian politician John Howard win four elections and secured two victories in London mayoral elections for Boris Johnson.He was reputedly paid £500,000 a year to advise Mr Cameron and helped him pull off a surprise victory over Ed Miliband in 2015.But his campaigning style is not to everyone’s taste. He is credited with inventing ‘dog whistle’ tactics, whereby politicians echo shrill sentiments on populist issues such as immigration, without actually endorsing them.This newspaper disclosed in 2012 how he told Mr Johnson not to bother with ‘f****** Muslims’ in his mayoral campaign, which was clearly echoed in the former Foreign Secretary’s controversial recent comments about the burka.Sir Lynton also once boasted of getting Australian PM Mr Howard elected despite privately calling him ‘as dull as bats***’.He calls his no-nonsense political style ‘getting the barnacles off the boat’ – to offer voters a streamlined message.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/21/4F9CA3DA00000578-0-image-a-15_1535834024498.jpg","title":"The shocking plight Americas child brides aged young 13","story":"    Donna Pollard (pictured aged 14) was raped in the year this photo was taken by her 29-year-old counsellor and forced to marry him two years later Indeed, that very act of matrimony helped Donna’s abuser, a mental health counsellor almost twice her age, evade charges for statutory rape under laws that only applied to younger victims and could have put him behind bars for many years.‘I am appalled the law could allow such a thing,’ Donna told me. ‘Laws are supposed to protect victims, not the people who exploit them.

Donna, pictured now, is fighting back against her abuserAnd there are thousands more of these disturbing cases scattered across the United States, a few involving girls not yet into their teens when forced into matrimony. Some hail from religious communities, some from poor rural areas, some from prosperous cities.This is the legacy of archaic laws and outdated views on teenage pregnancy.Astonishingly, child marriage is still sanctioned in much of the United States – and some conservative politicians and libertarian activists fight to protect the practice.Although data is incomplete, one study found that, during the first 15 years of this century, at least 207,459 minors – legally defined as those under 18 – were allowed to marry. Almost all were girls, and most were aged 16 and 17 – but 12-year-olds received permits in three states and 13-year-olds in 14 states, including Kentucky.In Alabama, a 74-year-old man was given a licence to marry a 14-year-old girl – yet, as in many other cases including Donna’s, this relationship would have led to a statutory rape charge and being placed on the sex offenders register had it occurred outside marriage.Kentucky had the third-highest number of US child marriages, with 11,000 being permitted since 2000. But thanks to the efforts of Donna – who was one of those cases – a new law signed last month bans unions for people under 18 – although 17-year-olds can marry if they meet strict restrictions.          Judy Wiegand - aged just 13 - is pictured when she was forced to marry the man who had raped her Donna’s story is horrific, although ultimately inspiring. Her father, a long-distance lorry driver, was loving but often away with work. He already had two children when, at 17, he married Donna’s mother, who was just 13 at the time and later suffered mental health problems.Her mother was cold and violent, frequently beating her with a stick. When Donna was 13, her father died and soon after she began to fight back when attacked by her mother. As a result, she was sent to see a psychologist and ended up in a special behavioural unit for five weeks.There, the vulnerable, lonely girl was seized upon by a 29-year-old counsellor. ‘He was very nice to me, very compassionate, making me feel special with lots of attention,’ said Donna. ‘I just wanted to please him because I wanted someone to be kind to me.’My 15 years in a cult: Glenn Close on the devastating effect...Family of Osama bin Laden fear his son is intent on...Share this articleSoon they were having secret meetings, hugs and finally sex – although she was just 14. After Donna’s release, incredibly, her own mother drove her weekly to a hotel to carry on the relationship. ‘She saw him as an exit card, a way to relieve the burden of me.’Shortly after Donna’s 16th birthday, the counsellor’s own mother discovered what was going on and threatened to tell the police. The man whipped out a gun, threatened to kill himself, then turned it on his mother and drove her out of the house.Within days, Donna and her abuser were before a court clerk, who did not even look up from her computer when asking who was the minor. Donna’s mother and the official signed a licence – and the troubled teenager was taken straight off to be married by a preacher to a paedophile.          Glenda Welp with the violent neighbour she was forced to marry at 14 and their daughter, Tabitha Her school turned her away, so Donna lost a precious scholarship and her education was stymied. She was pregnant at 17, yet her controlling and violent husband forced her to work in a strip club, making her hand over wages and procure him drugs and girls.She determined to flee after seeing her infant daughter laugh – thinking they were playing a game – while she was being throttled on the ground by her husband. ‘I went to a domestic violence centre,’ said Donna. ‘But they turned me away since I was under 18 and a minor.’She finally escaped at 19. Remarkably, she went on to college and obtained a degree a few years later, but kept her abuse and marriage hidden even from friends while struggling with serious psychological damage, including depression and severe anxiety.Two years ago, aged 32 and working as a health care manager, Donna decided to find out if other women had suffered similar situations and ended up talking with Jeanne Smoot from the Tahirih Justice Center, which opposes gender-based violence. ‘I told her my goal was to change the law in my home state,’ she said.Smoot, senior counsel with the TJC, argues such cases show the urgent need for reform across the country. ‘The state is failing to recognise child abuse,’ she said. ‘These laws are the vestige of antiquated and misguided assumptions of what is in a girl’s best interests.’Smoot added that many terrified victims went to courts desperately hoping they would be saved by officials, only to find their trauma intensifying.‘One girl told me she was crying, which the court clerk interpreted as jitters and told her it should be the happiest day of her life.’          Glenda (pictured today) is now fighting back against the abuse she suffered The Kentucky reform was promoted by Republican state senator Julie Adams, who said she was astounded when she met Donna last autumn. ‘My jaw was on the floor as she was telling her story,’ she said. ‘It was mind-boggling. I had no idea about child marriage.’Yet when she raised the issue, Adams was stunned by the volume of emails and letters she received from women disclosing similar experiences. ‘As a society, we allowed this marginalisation of women to be legal. We had to connect our civil and criminal laws.’The issue exposes great hypocrisy in a country that campaigns against child marriage around the world. ‘There’s no place in civilised society for the early or forced marriage of children,’ said Barack Obama when president.He is right. Yet it only really emerged in the US when a few brave survivors such as Donna started telling their life stories in public to protect future generations from suffering similar fates.Many women were suffering in silence, thinking their cases were unique. But since Donna set up a support group, called Survivors’ Corner, other women who have suffered similar experiences have come forward.Delaware became the first state to outlaw all marriage of minors in May, despite claims it would lead to more abortions from one opponent. Several others – including Texas, which had most marriages of minors this century – have updated and strengthened their laws.Yet 18 states still do not set an age floor, including Idaho, which has the highest rates of child marriage per head.Seven states have laws that accept pregnancy as a reason to waive minimum age rules and only 13 require minors to get approval from a judge before they marry.Reform has met resistance from some conservatives, including Albert Robinson, senator for the county where Donna lived when married.‘When he spoke against the bill, it was as if he was saying it was OK my rape was legal in his county because I was married,’ she told me.Robinson, a former sausage maker turned property dealer, told me he was opposed to government interference in family life. ‘The parents are the reason the child exists and I find it hard to believe any parents would force their child into marriage.‘If the parents of the father-to-be and the pregnant girl can work things out, that’s a lot better than having an abortion,’ he added. ‘My wife’s mother married at 14 and she arrived a year later – and she’s one of the best things that ever happened to me.’Robinson backs child marriage yet opposes marriage for gay and lesbian adults. He is not alone: in nearby Rowan county, which has permitted 92 minors to marry this century, the court clerk famously went to jail rather than issue wedding licences to same-sex couples.Such arguments over parental rights angered Judy Wiegand, a paediatric therapist who suffered deeply as a naive 13-year-old forced to marry her 17-year-old rapist.Wiegand never dared tell anyone about the assault at a roller skating rink, thinking she must have been partly to blame, but then became pregnant. ‘My father was very angry,’ she said. ‘But in my mind I thought I had broken the rules and put myself in a bad place.’They lived in a religious, ultra-conservative rural community, so the pair’s mothers agreed their teenagers should marry. When they went to see the county clerk to get a permit, ‘she looked at me down her glasses like I was tainted and never spoke to me,’ said Wiegand.She wore a yellow dress to get married, a slender girl weighing little more than five stone. ‘I still slept with a teddy bear and played with my Barbies. I just wanted it all to be over. There was a preacher but he did not really talk to me either.’Her subsequent story echoed others I heard: she was badly abused, her schooling was stopped, she became quickly pregnant again, then left after the child was threatened.Searching for security, she rebounded into another bad relationship before finally finding stability. ‘It was really hard to build a decent life,’ said Wiegand, now happily married. ‘I never had a first date, I never had a prom, I never graduated from school. I missed so much.’Some of these unions were horrifically violent, such as that of Glenda Welp, who at 14 was made to marry a neighbour twice her age who beat her regularly. She suffered seizures after having a typewriter smashed on her head when eight-months pregnant. When she managed to escape, her husband came after her with a gun. ‘He said he was going to kill me, my baby and then himself.’Fortunately Welp’s mother called the police. ‘He was just getting ready to shoot us when he heard the siren and ran off, but still tried taking the TV.’Others were treated less violently but were still victims of paedophiles, such as Loretta Scott, a 38-year-old carer. She started being pursued aged just 12 by a man attending her Pentecostal church who befriended her family, then was forced to marry him by her parents three years later.‘I cried myself to sleep,’ she said. ‘He stopped me going to school, which was where all my friends were, and did not want me around boys. One time my brother came to visit but was told not to come back. He wanted to control everything and everyone who spoke with me.’After four years, she fled and later discovered her husband had married two other teenage girls. ‘It’s such a difficult thing to get over. I’ve never really talked about it with anyone,’ said Scott. ‘I have a girl of ten and I just can’t imagine sending her away.’Sherry Johnson, a prominent campaigner in Florida, revealed she was married to her rapist at 11 after becoming pregnant.Unsurprisingly, studies find child brides far more likely to suffer severe health, financial and educational difficulties throughout their lives than other women.Ironically, they also fare worse than unmarried teenage mothers since they are far more likely to quickly have a second child, said Vivian Hamilton, a law professor who has testified before several state hearings on the issue.Like so many others, Hamilton is stunned to find these practices still existing in the United States. ‘I don’t think God wants little girls marrying rapists,’ said one survivor to me.‘It is so bizarre that this is still going on in this day and age.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/15/4E32FB4100000578-0-image-m-59_1531493474914.jpg","title":"Britains Got Talent host Amanda Holden dogs womans best friend","story":"Amanda Holden, 47, shows off her sensational physique in...How to look this good at 47 without ever going on a diet:...Share this articleIt was love at first sight and Ruth says their long walks together are her ‘stress-reliever’ from hectic working life. ‘Stroking your dog releases stress – I totally believe it now.’SHIRLEY BALLAS: ‘MY POOCH FLIES FIRST-CLASS WITH ME’There’s no expense spared for the Strictly judge’s beloved pet (both pictured, below).

He said it left the country at risk of ‘economic vassalage’ and accused Mrs May of ‘dithering’ over the UK’s strategy.Momentum founder who propelled Jeremy Corbyn to leadership...Raab insists a Brexit deal is \u0027within our reach\u0027 after new...Share this articleMeanwhile, Mrs May’s allies say that executives working for Sir Lynton’s powerful campaign company, CTF Partners, have been in discussions to ‘put rocket boosters’ under Change Britain, a group set up to argue for a hard Brexit, and turn it into a guerilla campaign against the Chequers deal.They fear that the group will mount rallies around the country headed by Mr Johnson and other high-profile Brexiteers. Change Britain has strong links with the influential European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.Mrs May’s allies believe that Sir Lynton’s outfit has been targeting Eurosceptic Tory donors to fund the campaign.They are also suspicious that Mr Jonson seems to have been ‘singing from the Lynton hymn sheet’ since his resignation – and point to the furore over Mr Johnson’s inflammatory claim that burkas make women look like ‘bank robbers’ or ‘letterboxes’. Sir Lynton, 62, is an exponent of so-called ‘dog-whistle politics’, in which controversial messages, couched in relatively inoffensive language, are targeted at the Hard-Right.          The Prime Minister (pictured in Cape Town) last night vowed not to make any compromises to the Chequers deal, nor to ‘give in’ to demands for a second referendum Sir Lynton, dubbed the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for his previous successes, lost some of his lustre after playing a key role in the disastrous 2017 Election campaign which led to the loss of Mrs May’s Commons majority.The row comes as MPs return to the Commons after the summer recess to prepare for a series of bruising battles over Brexit, with Mrs May hoping to strike a final deal with the EU within the next two months and then win Parliament’s approval. But she faces opposition from dozens of Tory MPs in the ERG, who share Mr Johnson’s objections to the Chequers deal.It has led to intense speculation among MPs that if Mrs May tries to force Chequers through, then the ERG would force a vote of no confidence in her. If 48 MPs make such a call, then a vote would be held, triggering a leadership contest if Mrs May lost.A source close to Mr Johnson said: ‘Boris has always backed the aims of Change Britain but he has no role in the organisation.’A spokesman for CTF said that while Sir Lynton had not personally ‘spoken with nor met anyone from Change Britain’, the company’s senior staff ‘were often consulted because of their campaign expertise and knowledge’.He added: ‘The better the deal the Prime Minister secures in Brexit, the better the prospects for the Conservatives at the next Election.’   SIMON WALTERS: Revenge of \u0027Wizard of Oz\u0027 Sir Lynton Crosby blamed for Theresa May\u0027s election humiliationThe feud between Sir Lynton Crosby and Theresa May dates back to her disastrous decision to call a snap election in June 2017.Both are said to blame each other for the fiasco.When Australian-born Crosby first heard of the snap poll from a May aide, he was in Fiji at a family gathering and his stunned response was: ‘I’m not sure that’s a smart idea, mate.’The Mail on Sunday revealed last year how he sent Mrs May a ‘killer memo’ warning her it could backfire. He said there was ‘a lot of risk’ in calling a surprise ballot: voters were desperate to ‘avoid uncertainty’– but by going to the polls, she was doing the opposite.Instead of the landslide win she expected, she could do no better than David Cameron’s narrow win in 2015, Crosby advised. In the event she did worse, and lost her Commons majority.For their part, Mrs May’s supporters said she blamed him for key campaign mistakes.They blamed Crosby for ordering her to run a presidential style ‘strong and stable’ campaign which collapsed days after the manifesto launch when she was forced to tear up plans for a so-called ‘dementia tax.’ Sir Lynton also fell out with Mrs May’s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy, with Timothy subsequently accusing him of failing to spot Jeremy Corbyn’s support among young voters.          Theresa May and election guru Lynton Crosby, pictured, are said to blame each other for the Conservatives\u0027 failure to win a majority at the snap election in June 2017Tough-talking Crosby is known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’ because of his record of election campaign successes.He helped Right-wing Australian politician John Howard win four elections and secured two victories in London mayoral elections for Boris Johnson.He was reputedly paid £500,000 a year to advise Mr Cameron and helped him pull off a surprise victory over Ed Miliband in 2015.But his campaigning style is not to everyone’s taste. He is credited with inventing ‘dog whistle’ tactics, whereby politicians echo shrill sentiments on populist issues such as immigration, without actually endorsing them.This newspaper disclosed in 2012 how he told Mr Johnson not to bother with ‘f****** Muslims’ in his mayoral campaign, which was clearly echoed in the former Foreign Secretary’s controversial recent comments about the burka.Sir Lynton also once boasted of getting Australian PM Mr Howard elected despite privately calling him ‘as dull as bats***’.He calls his no-nonsense political style ‘getting the barnacles off the boat’ – to offer voters a streamlined message.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/22/4F9C480A00000578-0-image-a-10_1535835849977.jpg","title":"Black box recorders fitted thousands young drivers cars","story":"    Black box recorders are to be fitted to thousands of young drivers\u0027 cars in a Government experiment to cut road accidents (stock photo)Some learners will pledge to drive carefully in \u0027mentor agreements\u0027 with their parents to see if it improves road safety while others will take hazard tests in video game simulators.Did Britain\u0027s man in Argentina commit treason over the...Theresa May rumbles Boris plot to oust her: Johnson guru\u0027s...Share this articleAnother group will spend a day in a classroom learning about the risks of getting behind the wheel by themselves, and a final trial will increase the time learners spend on the road before they take their practical driving test.Called Driver 2020, the scheme will assess which of the five different interventions has the greatest impact on driver behaviour and road safety.

Ashley is currently in talks with landlords over how many of House of Fraser’s 59 outlets will close.In a voting advice, Pensions \u0026amp Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) said governance worries included “the excessive influence of Mike Ashley over the board and the running of the company”, and the fact there were no female directors on the board, which was “not acceptable”. It also claimed that the board had “consistently failed” to deal with concerns about employment practices that were the subject of a scathing MPs’ report in 2016, which branded conditions as those akin to a “Victorian workhouse”.  A second advisory group, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), said there were “ongoing operational, governance and risk oversight concerns”, and it criticised the company’s “apparent unwillingness” to address the worries of independent shareholders.It said these concerns had been “exacerbated” this year by the appointment of Michael Murray, Ashley’s future son-in-law, to a key management role – his title is “head of elevation” – alongside a proposal to pay him £5m for his property consultancy work.ISS and Pirc both criticised Hellawell, a former police chief constable and ex-government “drugs tsar”, with the former saying that previous no-confidence votes from independent shareholders suggested that his continuation in the position of chairman was “not tenable”, and the latter highlighting “concerns over the lack of leadership ... due to the influence of the chief executive”. Murray, who turns 29 this month, was put in charge of Sports Direct’s property in 2015. However, ISS said the potential £5m payment to his company MM Prop Consultancy was not subject to shareholder approval, and added that even though he was technically an outside contractor, the contract on offer was “significantly higher” than that of Jon Kempster, Sports Direct’s recently appointed chief financial officer, whose base salary is £150,000.Murray began his career running festivals and student nights while still at Reading University, and he met Anna Ashley on holiday in Majorca in 2011. The couple now reportedly live together in a £10m home in Belgravia, central London.Sports Direct recently raised the stakes in its negotiations with House of Fraser store owners, warning that it would be the fault of “greedy landlords” if hundreds of retail jobs were lost as a result of looming closures.Last week, a report named Sports Direct as “the UK’s least reputable retailer”. The claim was made by the Reputation Institute, which describes itself as the world’s leading research and advisory firm for reputation. It said the sports retailer performed worst on four measures in the report: workplace, governance, citizenship and leadership.A spokesperson for Sports Direct said: “We hope shareholders will continue to recognise the further positive progress that we have made over the last 12 months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35e3073831f2dd37ee74ac07ed545984e5f4c5be/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d673268d54879601f5757751ff32a6f1","title":"new centre party tory labour mps","story":"On Saturday, I am heading to Cambridge to take part in the second annual Big Tent Ideas Festival, a cross-party gathering designed to encourage open and civil conversation about the pressing political issues of our times. Caricatured in 2017 as the “Tory Glastonbury”, the festival is co-chaired this year by its founder, George Freeman, the Conservative MP for Mid Norfolk, and Sally Morgan, Labour peer and a former minister. Its governing principle is a desire to escape the shrillness of social media and the feverish polarisation of Westminster, and to nurture ecumenical debate in an age of tribalism.Lurking beneath this, of course, is the collective identity crisis of centre-ground politicians and thinkers, still reeling from the double whammy of the EU referendum and Donald Trump’s election, anxious about their future role in a seething political culture that seems increasingly dominated by Brexit, antisemitism and ideological fixity.I understand completely why so many moderate Tories are in despair at the rush of former Ukip members joining their party to ensure that Theresa May’s successor conforms to their nationalist principles. I understand completely why Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead, resigned the Labour whip, appalled by Jeremy Corbyn’s record on antisemitism.I disagree profoundly with Field on EU membership – he is a passionate Brexiteer – but he is also a man of compassion, tireless industry and strong moral principle who, as minister and backbencher, has done as much as any parliamentarian in recent decades to address poverty, welfare reform and the relationship between the two. Any party that loses him is the lesser for it.Though Field, as so often, acted alone, his decision has given pause to the many MPs on both sides of the Commons who have been considering, with varying levels of seriousness, the formation of a new centre party. It is true that, at present, this is a more pressing question in Labour’s ranks. But that would change in a heartbeat if Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg were to become the next Conservative leader. Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry have already indicated that they would leave the party were the former foreign secretary to succeed May, and others feel the same way but have yet to say so publicly.Again, I understand completely the arguments and emotions that are driving centre-ground politicians to contemplate such drastic measures. But I hope that – on both sides – they restrain themselves. Prophecy is a dangerous game these days, but this much I know: a new centre party would fail.Why so? First, because it would resemble a coalition of losers, an institutionalised flounce. It would be defined – with some justice – as the liberal elite going on strike until the voters restore it to office. As one very senior politician who was involved in preliminary talks about a new movement said to me: “It would look like a Madame Tussauds of past politics. All those familiar faces in one place? Disaster.”Second, such a party would be bound together by the weakest of forces. Opposition to Brexit is what most of the potential members of such a grouping have in common. But that is the basis for a campaign, rather than a new party seeking office. When it comes to fiscal policy, public sector reform, the fine balance between liberty and equality, and much else besides, there is a reason that Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper are in the Labour party and Grieve and Nicky Morgan are Tories.Any party that wants to be taken seriously in our representative democracy must very quickly produce 650 candidates to run in a general election. I do not doubt that funding would be found for this putative undertaking: Simon Franks, the founder of LoveFilm, is said to have raised £50m to pour into such a project, and unconfirmed rumours continue to swirl around Westminster about the potential munificence of George Soros. But human capital is always harder to find than the financial variety. A parliamentary system requires any new party to have hundreds of candidates ready to stand for election to Westminster – not to mention the devolved assemblies and local authorities. Where are all these people?I recommend that wavering Tories and Labour politicians – understandably tormented by the present shabby state of politics – read James Carville’s book, Stickin’: The Case for Loyalty. As Bill Clinton’s former chief strategist, Carville knows all there is to know about allegiance under stress. But, as he writes: “Loyalty not taxed is really not loyalty … untested loyalty is just a bromide.” Carville does not mean unquestioning sycophancy, or career-saving cowardice. He is referring to the stamina and patience that are so unfashionable in the digital age, but so necessary to the preservation of all political ideas in a party system.Tony Blair did not join the Social Democratic party, but stood his ground as a Labour MP for 11 years before becoming party leader. Jeremy Corbyn, to be fair, waited 32 years to assume the same office. Sheer cussed tenacity is an underrated quality in modern politics.Which is not to say that centre-ground politicians can sit back and wait for the pendulum to swing back their way. There is no pendulum – only human agency, and the readiness to fail seven times but win on the eighth attempt. The answer to Ukip entryism is to recruit more Tory moderates. The answer to Corbynism is to present a centre-left alternative that is genuinely suited to 2018 rather than 1997. Yes, all this is incredibly hard. But who said it was going to be easy?Never has it been more important for the decent to stand up to the intemperate, to ignore the promptings of fatigue and pride. Designing your own comfort zone is for losers. Stand and fight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba0192baee11fa50a346d4de9d52d8b7528504c/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3bfcb50c07e0c1230491f58dbba5ddd","title":"party conferences tories labour lib dems","story":"Theresa May has been a wounded leader for more than a year now, and has survived extraordinarily long. But the attention will turn this autumn to who her successor will be.Her survival has largely been as a result of the decision of the Conservative 1922 Committee of backbenchers to keep her in place so that there is some stability in the Brexit negotiations. But those are nearing their conclusion, and so the campaigns of would-be successors will become even less subtle than they already are.In order to stop the party descending into an embarrassingly vain scrap over the next leader, May does need to maintain her authority with a strong autumn conference performance.It will hardly be difficult to surpass her disastrous speech last year, but the prime minister does need to give a sense that she wants to achieve things while she is still in the role, rather than that she is just planning to hang on for dear life.• Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the SpectatorLabour has endured a summer of discontent. The leadership’s Build it in Britain campaign was marginalised by intractable rows over antisemitism and the spectre of a party split. But Corbynites stoically point out that the party’s poll ratings are little changed and that the Tories’ Brexit wars will soon re-erupt. At this month’s party conference, the left will entrench its hegemony through rule changes to give members greater power over policymaking and to reduce MPs’ role in leadership elections.Meanwhile, like a dark star, Brexit will absorb much energy. Labour has not ruled out backing a “people’s vote” but will do so only if politically essential.Team Corbyn’s priority remains triggering a general election, and the party is all but certain to oppose any exit deal Theresa May achieves. Away from the technicalities of Brexit, Labour will seek to shift the focus towards the alternative economic and social model it aspires to build.• George Eaton is political editor of the New StatesmanIn theory, the political landscape looks remarkably promising for Liberal Democrats.Leaders of the two main parties are both deeply unpopular, with “neither” being the most popular choice when voters are asked who they would like as prime minister? Check. Lib Dems have a distinctively different position from both Labour and Conservatives on the biggest issue of the day? Check. Membership at record levels? Check. Raising as much in donations from non-trade union sources as Labour? Check. Regularly gaining seats at council byelections? Check.The reality is, of course, not quite so rosy – only just approaching regular double figures in the polls, 12 MPs and self-inflicted mistakes such as over that recent Brexit vote.The challenge now is for the party both to make its own luck and to seize the lucky breaks that others offer up to turn that opportunity into reality.• Mark Pack is editor of Liberal Democrat Newswire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4127bfc78149987df50b91d0971040dc3c30b08d/0_223_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4926e59dcd13d46f195a11b7472a526","title":"the guardian view on education some things money should not buy","story":"Competition makes losers as well as winners. This fact makes a simple rule for judging when it is useful to society and when it is dangerous. Can we afford to look after the losers? They are not going to vanish. From about 1979 to 2008, policymakers across the western world were agreed that there were hardly any problems that could not be solved by organising some kind of market, from which the magic of competition would produce much better results than planned cooperation ever could. The last 10 years has been a time for unlearning all those lessons and there are few places where this is more obvious than in education.The introduction of the academy system was among other things an attempt to make central planning impossible. The market, and the self-interest of parents, would ensure that good schools flourished and bad ones – well, they would disappear, perhaps by osmosis. Yet local authorities still have a statutory duty to ensure that every child has a school place – and the political imperative to avoid discontent among parents who vote\u0026nbsp– even while the means to do so have largely vanished now that two thirds of secondary schools are academies which they do not control. One result is last week’s report that the country is facing a shortfall of more than 100,000 secondary school places over the next five years, as a demographic bulge pushes upwards\u0026nbspthrough the school system.By encouraging parental choice in schools, successive governments hoped to harness the ambition of families to give their children the best education possible. But this ambition is by its nature limited. It does not extend to other people’s children. In fact, the system lives up to Gore Vidal’s sardonic observation that “it is not enough to succeed others must fail”. The burden of student loans increases the price of failure for those who fail to get into the “right” universities or study the “right”, for which read lucrative, subjects. The result is an increase of inequality without any corresponding increase in quality at the top.One measure of this is house prices. State schools\u0026nbspwith a good reputation increase the price of houses in their catchment areas substantially. A survey released last week showed that outside London parents were willing to pay up to three times the average price for a house to get their children into desirable schools. In north London, a house in a good catchment area is worth £75,000 more than one less favoured, although this represents a much smaller proportion of the average price.These figures point up a general hollowing out of trust in the state system, which the introduction of competition both reflected and greatly exacerbated. Catchment areas operate as a kind of pre-exclusion mechanism, which keeps poorer children out of good schools just as surely as later exclusions can expel them. In all this, both schools and parents are responding to the logic, and the incentives, of a system predicated on competition as a zero-sum game. We are all poorer as a result.At the same time, universities, which do need in some cases to be places of fierce competition which will identify and train the very best scholars and researchers, are forced by internecine competition to distort their own priorities. The incentives there are just as skewed. It is at least arguable that the cost of bad or just under-resourced schools to society, as well as to the children involved, far outweighs the benefits that competition has bought the good ones. School\u0026nbspsystems should be judged on the basis of their worst performances, not their best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66740be7187f44bad4ee4e6c012d5cbd2024fcc3/0_3_3044_1827/master/3044.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93022eb9065e03aa06f7d315b72e3a24","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1fc7be2383a85f2ab2b5d35f32bd827d4210f72/0_833_6079_3647/master/6079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6a97c7b4779a01c255ced461d1c0ea9","title":"actor jade anouka meets boxer nicola adams interview","story":"Actor Jade Anouka prepared to play Hotspur by watching videos of boxer Nicola Adams. Adams, in turn, acted in her youth and hopes to again. They met up to talk breaking boundaries, performance, and superheroesNicola Adams has come straight from training camp, and in her bespoke “Nicola Adams” hoodie and trainers, she looks as if she has just ducked under the ropes of the boxing ring for a water break.She is at first watchful, shy, and looks so diminutive in her sports gear that she could be mistaken for a woman of delicate build. She is anything but delicate, of course. Aged 35, she is a two-time Olympic gold-medal winner – once in London’s 2012 Games, in the flyweight ision, and again in 2016, at Rio de Janeiro.She is now preparing for her first world-title professional fight on 6 October and has been up since 6am, travelling from her home in Leeds, where she was born, to train at full tilt at a gym in Sheffield alongside elite pros. She is the only woman there, she says, but “I’m used to that now”.She keeps a steely eye on the fight, even in her downtime. Here, later, in the Rotherham hotel where we meet, she stares past the cheese and bread platters piled in front of her and orders lamb because no carbs must be eaten after 7pm, and then she must be tucked up in bed by 9pm so she can be fully rested for camp the next day. She is tired right now, she says, though her eyes are alive and her smile is a beam that lights up her face.Jade Anouka is in a hoodie and a pair of trainers too when she turns up but she is taller than Adams and less taciturn. An actor and poet from south-east London, Anouka has appeared at the National Theatre, worked with the RSC and won acclaim for star parts in the all-female Shakespeare trilogy at the Donmar Warehouse, London, directed by Phyllida Lloyd, in which she played Mark Anthony (Julius Caesar), Hotspur (Henry IV) and Ariel (The Tempest). Hailed as a rising star by the London Evening Standard and a star of tomorrow by Screen International, she has also starred in Mike Bartlett’s TV drama Trauma, and alongside Sheridan Smith in the forthcoming ITV series Clean Break. All at 28, or that is the age she is reported to be – she refuses to confirm it: “I have lost parts because of my age. So now I feel my playing age,” she says with a glint.She has come from her own training camp, of sorts. She is in rehearsals for Queen Margaret, which brings an ancillary female character from four Shakespeare history plays to the fore, and which opens in mid-September at Manchester’s Royal Exchange theatre.There is a fizzing excitement between them when they meet and they seem lit up in each other’s presence: Anouka is excitable and animated while Adams is thoughtful and earnest. Her shyness melts away so that they are speaking over each other, laughing, sparring with their words.Their professional identities seem far removed from each other at first glance: Adams the boxer Anouka the actor. But affinities are found quickly. Before Adams became an Olympic boxer, she partly funded her training by working as a TV extra (on Coronation Street and Emmerdale, among other soaps, but “once I got into the Olympics it took away my extra work because I couldn’t blend into the background any more”). She would like to take up acting in all seriousness after hanging up her gloves. Anouka, for her part, has learned how to throw a credible punch on stage.They are inquisitive about each other’s practice in all its minutiae – training regimes, learning lines, hours spent honing their craft through repetition. As they talk, the similarities between boxing and acting become striking, as well as the preparation that leads up to a live show. Perhaps because both are currently in preparation for a performance, this hiatus in their training schedules carries an intensity their focus on each other is unwavering and the conversation feels weighed with mutual learning, as well as genuine awe.Nicola Adams So what got you into boxing?Jade Anouka It was my acting. I was playing a Shakespeare role in Henry IV. It was set in a women’s prison and I was playing the part of Hotspur, who is known as a sort of hot-head who goes out to war, and we imagined him as having all this extra energy that he didn’t know what to do with in prison. We were thinking of how he would release the energy and thought of him in a gym. So we had a boxing match on stage, and I had to learn to box.NA What was that like, acting it out?JA Kind of weird. I was doing Shakespeare and learning to do press-ups and routines on a punchbag. The scene starts as a boxing match, but it becomes a proper fight. I just loved it.JA Is boxing good for using that?NA Yeah. It gets rid of it all.JA That’s why I went into acting. I just wanted to do stuff when I was little, and I was doing athletics, but then we moved house and the athletics team that used to be our arch rivals became my local team. My mum said I needed to do something at the weekend and acting was exactly that – a good way to expel that extra energy.NA I started training when I was 12, and it was after I had my first match when I was 13 that I felt that this is what I wanted to do. I said to myself: “I want to be a boxer. I want to go to the Olympics.” I used to watch a lot of reruns of Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard going to the Olympics and winning medals.JA It’s funny, what you say about watching Muhammad Ali. When I was training for the part of Hotspur, I spent so many hours watching videos of you. I needed a reference point in the boxing world to the character I was playing. All I knew of boxing came from staying up until 2am to watch Mike Tyson fight, but that was different, so I began watching videos of you and I remember in one video you did the Muhammad Ali shuffle.JA It looked like it was so hard to do. But I loved the idea of the lightness of it, and the quickness, so I put it into the show. I liked the confidence of that shuffle, that swagger almost, it was so infectious. When I was watching it, I thought: “What did she just do?”NA In the middle of competing, you get these moments where you’re just feeling so good. The crowd hypes you up, you hear the cheering and you feed off it.JA It makes me think of the performance of it.JA I was thinking about the similarities in the prep between our work. How long do you train for before a fight?NA I’ve been in training camp now for 15 weeks and I’ve got eight weeks left. Training means practising the moves constantly over and over again so that it becomes muscle memory, and when I get into the ring I do it automatically.JA There are things like that in theatre – the lines, for a start. You need to learn them so you don’t have to think about them on stage. That’s a kind of muscle memory. If you spend too much time thinking about the lines when you’re performing, you’re not in the moment. You want the lines to just come, so if a fellow actor gives something different to what was expected, you can just respond.NA It’s almost the same thing with me. You never know what your opponent is going to do to you. You have to be in the moment and react they might do something and you think: “Wait a minute, you weren’t supposed to do that”.JA But even before I start learning lines, I research. I’m rehearsing for Queen Margaret at the moment, which retells the Wars of the Roses from the Shakespeare plays, Henry VI Parts I, II and III and Richard III, but from Queen Margaret’s point of view. People don’t know much about her, but she was awesome. I’m playing her, but before I started learning the lines I researched her and the plays, trying to work out who this person was. I don’t know if you research your opponent?NA We do. We watch videos and go way back to see if there are bad habits or things that they do so we can pick up on them.JA What’s training like? Do you have any fights during training camp?NA No, we only spar. But normally the training is a lot harder than the fights.JA That’s the same for me. Rehearsals are hard. What you live for is to be on the stage, and that’s only hard if you haven’t done enough prep.NA Same. You come unstuck. It has only happened to me once but that was enough. I went to a tournament in Poland and I boxed a Russian girl in the finals she was the type of boxer that doesn’t stop coming forward and throwing punches. At the time, I wasn’t that fit and I thought I might just be able to weave my way round it but it was the hardest match I have ever had in my life. I won it, but it was hard. She was swinging me around, I was looking at my corner thinking “Somebody save me!” When you’re not fit and someone keeps throwing punches there’s nowhere to go. It’s just you up there.NA Definitely. Boxing rounds are only two minutes, but they feel like for ever, whereas the one-minute break goes in a flash.Both women are British, born with Caribbean heritage. They have, in their professional lives, entered spaces traditionally defined as “male” – that have either excluded women, black women, or both. Adams became the first woman to win an Olympic boxing gold in 2012, but long before that, a path had to be created to allow her even to train and be taken seriously in a sport that for centuries had been the preserve of men.Anouka, meanwhile, has felt the right to take on roles formerly restricted to white, male actors. She does not think she is standing on a level playing field, but does feel degrees of levelling, and both women talk about the need to forge opportunities for new generation of women.NA It was hard coming up in a career that was so male-dominated. Sexism has been the biggest issue. It’s changed a lot compared to how it used to be – some of my friends would go to boxing gyms and get told that they didn’t have the facilities or didn’t accept women boxers.Female boxers had to create the path so that the girls coming up now don’t have to struggle. It’s great to see that there’s a process now: they know they can go to a club, to the national championships, box for England and then go on to the Olympics. When we were coming up, there wasn’t that path. We had to create it by knocking down the doors. We’d say “Hey, we want to box” and people would say “Why don’t you go and play tennis?” All the stuff about being in the kitchen – it was hard to fight through it.JA For me, I’ve been in roles that have reclaimed history and told old stories from a new perspective. But still, they say that more women apply for drama school, yet there are more parts for men at the end, and that goes for race as well. If I think about actors who are role models for me, a lot of them are American and not as many British. You find role models in aspects of people but you ultimately find your own way.What you’ve done, Nicola, is incredible, because there was literally nothing there. You had to knock down walls. Not many people can do that.NA It was tough. Once we got into the Olympics in London, it cemented women’s boxing.JA Do you think it had an effect on women’s boxing in Britain more than other countries?NA Yeah, definitely. I remember the coach saying to me that two of the other girls hadn’t managed a medal and that it was all about me now. I felt like women’s boxing would be back in the corner if I didn’t get one.NA But I like the pressure, it makes me perform better.JA There’s always a moment for me in rehearsals when I think: “Why do I do this?” But I feel like the doubt is there because I’ve taken on something scary, and when you come through that and feel the confidence on the other side of it you feel so much stronger.As they talk, more surprising affinities emerge. Both love action and superhero films. “Who is your favourite superhero?” asks Anouka, and then nods approvingly when Adams picks Spider-Man, though they differ in their choice of X-Men (it is Wolverine for Adams and Iceman for Anouka). And if the debates around Idris Elba’s possible casting as the next James Bond have been hotly contested, Anouka has staked her own claim, telling the Daily Mail earlier this year: “I’d love to have a crack at James Bond.” When Black Panther was released in Britain, she saw it as a groundbreaking moment for black actors and launched a crowdfunding campaign so that underprivileged members of the community in south London could see it.I really felt that Black Panther was important for the next generation to see that there’s a way, to say: “Look, you can get there, those openings are available, although we need to make them more so.” So I crowdfunded the money and we got 200 young people to watch it in Peckham. They were all in there together and it was so alive. It was incredible, as an actor myself, seeing the impact a film can have on people. We did a Q\u0026ampA afterwards with one of the stunt girls in Black Panther. She’s been my body double before and she is one of the army in the film.NA It’s funny you should say that. I went to be a stunt double for the film but I couldn’t do it because it would have taken too much time out of the boxing training. I went just for a day to see what the training would be like and it looked intense. I do boxing but I don’t really do any kicking or swimming, or know the different weapons to fight with. I’d love to be in an action film. Rocky needs to have a daughter in Creed.NA Have you got any tips for me, for acting?JA No, you’ve got it all. Knowing what it’s like to train, to prep, to have all the pressure on the night of the performance. The basics of both our worlds are the same. You prep, you get scared, but ultimately, there’s no magic trick. You’ve got to put the work in and then just go out there and perform.Queen Margaret runs at Manchester’s Royal Exchange from 14 September until 6 October.

Week after week they fret as their 12-year-old, a diminutive but naturally gifted midfield general, is harried off the ball by bigger players.But change may be on the way. Grouping young footballers according to physical maturity, as opposed to age – a practice called biobanding – improves performance and reduces the chances of injury, according to research that will be examined by coaches in many sports.The study, by a team at the University of Bath’s department for health and published in the Journal of Sports Sciences, is the first to explore young players’ experiences of competing in a biobanded tournament.Advocates of biobanding – used extensively in New Zealand for rugby union – claim that, by grouping players together according to their size and strength, late developers are given a greater chance to shine while players of all sizes are likely to see their game improve. The initiative, organised by the Premier League, involved players aged between 11 and 14 drawn from the academy teams of Reading, Southampton, Stoke City and Norwich City football clubs.They played in three 11-a-side games on a full-size pitch with 25-minute halves. They then compared their experience with a normal age-group competition. Significantly, they all said the experience had been positive and recommended that the league integrate biobanding into its games programme.The bigger boys, who were used to dominating normal training, reported being stretched by the physical challenge of the biobanded games. They told researchers that the matches better prepared them for games involving more physically able opponents, including adult teams. Findings suggested they were encouraged to adapt their game and emphasise technique, tactics and teamwork over physicality.For smaller boys, researchers found, the biobanded tournament was less of a physical challenge, but gave them a greater chance to show their skills, exert influence in the game and take on leadership roles. They reported greater confidence and composure on the ball – something that previous studies have shown to be a key predictor of success and development in sports.“It gives us more freedom,” one player told researchers. “We get a chance to prove to ourselves that when we are up against people our same size, we’re really good and can make an impact on the game.”The study’s lead author, Dr Sean Cumming, said he hoped to consider biobanding for rugby, cricket, gymnastics and ballet, too. “This training and selection regime can help coaches spot hidden talent among late maturers, and can reduce injury risk,” he said. “This study reinforces the positive effects biobanding can have for players across the spectrum – both early and late maturers.”Biobanding appears to be catching on around the world. In April, the US Soccer High Performance Department announced that it would work in conjunction with a number of clubs to put on the first biobanded event in any sport in the US.Clubs hope it will help them spot future stars among late developers. Arsenal famously rejected England captain Harry Kane when he was 11 years old, before he had developed physically.“Every player grows at a different rate, and biobanding educates sports science practitioners, coaches, players and parents on their level of physical maturity,” said Andy O’Boyle, the Premier League’s head of elite performance. “It helps late-maturing players in their development and offers different challenges to early-maturing players. Clubs have now developed biobanding initiatives themselves and regularly organise their own fixtures and tournaments, as well as using it to aid talent identification and strength and conditioning provision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34387022c4945ed5368a7387c8a9bccc18514cc0/0_362_4064_2439/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19754e07562d94da891c3f9c2b0ac9ee","title":"academic exposing ugly reality high fashion giulia mensitieri","story":"A new book by academic Giulia Mensitieri, laying bare the working conditions of stylists and young designers, has sparked controversy. Will it lead to improved conditions for those forced to work for clothes vouchers instead of cash?Giulia Mensitieri takes little to no personal interest in clothes. So it is likely to have been an ugly surprise to the French fashion industry that her PhD – now a book entitled The Most Beautiful Job in the World – has opened up its secretive profession in such a dramatically public way. In France, the book’s findings – that fashion, the country’s second-biggest industry, exploits most of the creatives who work in it – were quickly picked up by the media when it was published earlier this year. The resulting headlines included: “The ruthless world of fashion” “Fashion’s dirty underside” and “An extremely wealthy industry founded on unpaid work”.The reality of fashion was illustrated by Mensitieri’s chance introduction, eight years ago, to her subject matter. She met “Mia”, a successful Italian stylist who had moved to Paris: “She was wearing Chanel shoes and carrying a Prada handbag, being flown across the world in business class. I never would have imagined that she was in the situation she was in.” Mia couldn’t afford to rent a room, so she was couch surfing at a friend’s house behind a screen in the kitchen. “Sometimes she had no money for her phone bill. She was eating McDonald’s every day. She never knew when she would be paid for a job and how much she would get. For example, for a week’s work, a very big luxury brand gave her a voucher for €5,000 (£4,500) to spend in their boutique.” True, Mia could have sold it (and, among hard-up fashion workers, there is a lively market in reselling luxury goods). But Mensitieri points out that working in fashion means being seen in a constantly updated uniform of beautiful, expensive clothes and accessories – paid for by vouchers such as the one Mia received instead of a salary. “This situation is nothing exceptional. Mia is just a paradigm of what is going on.”The book is lively from the start. Mensitieri’s analysis and case studies build up a fairly damning picture of her subject matter. One interviewee, a former fashion journalist at a glossy magazine, describes how she was dropped by her coterie of friends and colleagues one day. They just suddenly stopped taking her calls or responding to her emails. There was no explanation. “This is the violence everyone told me about,” says Mensitieri. “Once you’re out, you’re out.” There can be a trauma attached to such sudden ejection. “All your social relationships are in that world. They’re gone.” From being exceptional, now you have transgressed in some unmentionable way. Or, simply, you are not special enough any more. “Finding work in a new sector can be difficult because ‘normal’ people behave so differently from what you’re used to.” Finding a job can be difficult, coming from an industry that those on the outside tend to look down on as fluffy and lightweight.Mensitieri, an alumni of École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, one of France’s elite grandes écoles, is in London to talk about her book, although it has not yet been translated into English. “I was a little bit scared when it came out,” she says, “because it’s quite a strong renunciation, even though that was not my goal. I’m an anthropologist, not a journalist.” The book’s salient claim is that, “when we think of exploitation in fashion we think of sweat shops abroad or sexual harassment of models. But that’s not what I was interested in. I was looking at the creative side: stylists, makeup artists, young designers, interns, assistants. What I really want to make clear is that exploitation exists at the very heart of the powerfully symbolic and economic centre of the maisons de couture the big luxury brands. But it is a different form of exploitation.” In some cases, also barely legal.Critics of the book complain that Mensitieri only interviewed 50 people for her analysis, all of them off the record. There are no statistics. Some took Karl Lagerfeld’s general view: “Fashion is a total injustice. It’s like that. And that’s it.” “But no one,” claims the author, “has said that what I’ve written isn’t true.”The big brands generally do not like the idea of an objective outsider meddling, but it seems that the people who work for them do. They have written to Mensitieri to say they had never considered themselves exploited before they read her book, wrapped up as they were in the industry’s glossy promise. “They say that, now they’ve read the book ... they began to see the big picture and little fragments of their own experiences,” says the author. “And once they understand the big picture, they can’t look at fashion and their job in fashion or themselves in the same way.”We meet at a London cafe where, I had read, staff are chosen for their looks and sex appeal. It is an example of the kind of social status that fashion is so good at conferring on those who work in it – in exchange, Mensitieri discovered, for not paying them enough, or at all. Or paying them in convoluted, unpredictable ways that cannot easily be turned into cash: an unexchangeable €1,000 voucher for a designer boutique, first-class flights to fashion shoots or accommodation in luxury hotels.“The message is, you don’t have to be paid because you are lucky to be there at all. Working in fashion is hyper socially validating, even if you’re unpaid. That’s an important point for me. Fashion presents itself as something exceptional, a world outside the ordinary,” she says. “There is a kind of confused denial of the norms of labour conditions. The dream that French fashion, especially, projects is that of a life of effortless luxury – mundane everyday facts of life such as working for a living, or indeed even money, are considered vulgar, taboo, even dirty subjects.“But is it really possible that France’s second most profitable industry after cars and before armaments – a €15bn industry – can be an exception in capitalism? To me, fashion is the very centre of contemporary capitalism – it upholds the old forms of exploitation factories in Bangladesh and so on – and the new, very modern forms which are more a kind of self-exploitation, a blurring of the line between your work and everything you are outside of work.”France’s fashion industry is intensely bound up with national identity. “Whoever does not visit Paris regularly will never truly be elegant,” Balzac wrote in 1830, and it is an image that the world’s centre of luxury shopping is keen to uphold. Louis Vuitton’s new flagship store, in Place Vendôme, for example, inhabits a building designed by Louis XIV’s favourite architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, who helped design the Palace of Versailles. To understand fashion’s reach and power, Mensitieri explains, look at the parade of designers President Emmanuel Macron invites to the Elysée palace. “The government is keenly aware of the industry’s economic and symbolic power,” she says. If the film Zoolander sums up the general public’s ideas about fashion in other countries, “In France, to say ‘I work in fashion’ is something extremely important.”To engage properly with her interviewees, Mensitieri had to learn the etiquette: “When to say ‘darling’, when to stay silent. Saying ‘no’ is uncool. ‘Yes’ can mean anything. And there is a kind of addiction to this adrenaline, this prestige, this idea of being exceptional. I talk in the book about ‘the jackpot’ – winner takes all. The economy of hope, I call it. ‘Maybe I will be next’, even though the statistics tell you it’s unlikely you will. Fashion is colonised by desirable projection. You are never present, because tomorrow will be better. It’s an addictive way of thinking.”Her interviewees talk a lot about personas and the need to invent one if they are to have any hope of success. A teetotal model describes how her agent told her to be more “rock’n’roll” – to wear leather jackets and to be seen in certain bars drinking beer. An assistant makeup artist describes the tantrums his very famous boss threw if his favourite green cotton wool buds were not laid out in a perfect square.“It starts in fashion school,” says Mensitieri. “The students there know they will be exploited but they don’t see themselves as exploited.”It is not just people working in fashion who might recognise themselves in these descriptions. It is a similar scene across all the creative industries and academia, says Mensitieri. She also makes a good comparison with the charity sector where, it is widely held, “doing good” is incompatible with being paid well.If her theory is true, does she think there is hope for reform? “If you want to change things, you have to look beyond fashion, or whatever industry you’re in, and talk to people in different fields who are working under the same conditions,” she says. “I’m not an optimistic person, but there are interesting things happening at the fringes. There is a strong anti-fashion movement in the UK and, in France, models are working together for better working conditions.” It’s advice that some people working in the fashion industry may not want to hear. “You need to start collaborating – which is an almost heretical thought in fashion. You need to stop thinking of yourself as special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9812b8a73d13ebed58405828775590e31b872143/393_462_5335_3201/master/5335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0ff3345d53c64e0cf76c7f251ac0a2c","title":"shahira yusuf i have always felt beautiful ","story":"Signed by the model agency that discovered Kate Moss, Londoner Shahira Yusuf is the outspoken and politically engaged Muslim model who is fast becoming the new face of ‘modest fashion’When Shahira Yusuf signed with Storm Models, the first thing she did was sit down with her agent and write a list. These were her “boundaries”, the rules that stylists and photographers should be made aware of before a shoot. She must have her arms covered, she must have her chest covered, and her hair. She must not be expected to wear clothes that are very tight, nor anything that makes her feel uncomfortable. “I’m fully prepared for some people not to like me, but it’s just as possible that would be because I’m a woman as because I wear the hijab,” she says. “But I’m firm, and headstrong, and I’m not going to succumb to negative voices.”The office of an international model agency is an interesting place in which to consider beauty. In reception a middle-aged man makes notes on the products he needs to buy to perfect his teenage daughter’s hair – she wobbles down the corridor in heels re-learning how to walk. The walls are covered with head shots: these are the faces that sell things, and these are the faces that define, for a season anyway, what beauty is. When only white girls, when only white girls with blonde hair and flat chests and shiny skin lead fashion campaigns and appear on the covers of magazines, then the implication is that other types of women are not beautiful. The impact of that ripples through women’s lives, influencing their self-worth, their identities, the limits of what is possible. Which is why this stuff matters. It matters that 21-year-old Yusuf, the youngest of eight siblings brought up in Stratford, east London, was signed by the agency that discovered Kate Moss. It matters that she is being promoted as the new face of “modest fashion”. Although, she says, matter-of-factly, “I have always felt beautiful.”In March, British Vogue featured a hijab-wearing model on its cover for the first time. Applause echoed across the media, but the model Halima Aden (who was born in a Kenyan refugee camp) wasn’t included solely because of a move towards ersity and equal representation – it was a canny, market-led move. The Islamic fashion industry is set to be worth £267bn by 2021. Yusuf joins a handful of young women whose hijabs mean that as well as holding down a modelling career, they have inadvertently become ambassadors for their faith. “I’m interested in talking about being Muslim,” Yusuf says, “but I’m not interested in being a role model. I feel that’s too much responsibility to put on a person. I do get, though, that we need more young people to look up to.”It was just before the 2016 referendum, as she became aware of the lack of NHS funding, that Yusuf decided to study politics – the Grenfell Tower fire cemented her decision. She plans to start a politics degree this year, balancing (she offers a nervous smile) modelling and studying. But often the two will leak into each other, as, with her newly elevated platform, she uses Twitter for activism, and finds herself discussing Brexit and immigration in the make-up chair. “Whether we like it or not, everybody is forced to be politically engaged today.”She rolls her eyes remembering Boris Johnson’s recent comparison of women in niqabs to letter boxes and bank robbers. “It’s so ignorant and it highlights the latent Islamophobia. Perhaps he’s trying to get attention and gain momentum, and hoover up the Ukip voters – either way, it’s such a silly comment. I don’t wear the niqab, but I know how it would make me feel if I did. Bank robbers? The idea that these are people who would do harm?” She tuts, generously. “These comments affect Muslims, they affect me.” There are positives to comments like Johnson’s though, she insists, because, “People like me are morally obliged to speak out, which means the media starts to reflect more Muslim voices.” What she’s learned, she says, is how important it is to “be in control of your learning, your understanding of a political situation. Don’t run with a single media source. I lean to the left – I like Corbyn, I think he’s acting for the majority – but I make sure I listen to other perspectives. It takes intelligence to be open to other voices.” She takes a measured breath, her hands in her lap. “The clever thing to do is listen to people who have relevant experiences. For instance, right now everybody should be listening to the experiences of refugees and immigrants, like my family who came from Somalia – immigrants are real people, deserving of empathy.”When setting boundaries for every shoot, her intention is not just to ensure she’s not pressured to go against her Muslim beliefs, but also to start a conversation about what is expected of a model, of a woman. “The fashion industry is a patriarchy,” she says, softly. “Mine is a conversation all women should be encouraged to have, about how comfortable they are showing their skin and their bodies, how comfortable they are being portrayed as sexual objects. I shouldn’t be listened to just because I’m religious. This conversation isn’t just for Muslim women.”Make-up artist Alex Babsky and manicurist Robbie Tomkins reveal how to achieve the striking effects seen on this season’s catwalksNew shapes: graphic eyesAB: If you’re bold enough to decorate your eyes with a slash of unexpected colour – as seen at Marni, Missoni and House of Holland – it has the most impact if you create a graphic, unblended shape. For the best colour pay-off, choose both a cream and a powder eyeshadow in a similar shade. Using a brush, draw and fill in your chosen shape with the cream eyeshadow. Don’t worry about creating a perfect shape. Follow this by pressing the powder colour into the shade you’ve drawn with a clean brush the cream texture will “grab” the powder eyeshadow and set. To finish, dip a cotton bud into a micellar cleansing water and run it around your eye shape, leaving a clean edge. RT: To get this look I chose a contrasting colour, but one in the same “cool” family, as blue tones compliment pinks and purples perfectly. Using matte top coats are a fantastic way to create a look easily. They turn any colour a more muted pastel shade with a smooth finish.Try: Tarte Waterproof Shadow Liner in Bubblegum MAC Eye Shadow in Sushi Flower Lancôme Eau Micellaire Douceur Muji Thin Cotton Buds SUQQU Nail Polish in Colour 08 OPI Matte Topcoat Vivid colours: eyes, lips, nailsAB: Traditionally, colour and drama in make-up is limited to either eyes or lips, but for AW 2018 Chanel, Pam Hogg and Richard Quinn showed vivid colour on both. To try this yourself, choose a single colour statement to create a halo around your eyes and define your lash line with plenty of mascara. For the lips, try a bright colour with a more sheer, shinier finish. This will prevent the combination of brightly coloured eyes and lips looking too “clown-ish”. Avoid adding a third colour with blush, and instead just warm up the complexion with bronzer.RT: We wanted to embody a 70s vibe in this look and that decade was all about glossy red nails.

Mascara YSL Rouge Pur Couture Lipstick 13 Le Orange Guerlain Terracotta Bronzing Powder 05 Smith \u0026amp Cult Nail Colour in Kundalini HustleMatte marvels: fuchsia lipsAB: For a splash of colour that’s more fun than a traditional red lip, try the fuchsia seen at the Margiela and Roksanda shows. With a matching liner, outline and fill in your lips – a matte-textured lipstick forgives lip-shape corrections, so you can afford to draw a generous shape – then apply three or four coats of lipstick with a brush, blotting between each. Apply a final layer with your finger – this softens the edge slightly, and as long as you press colour upwards into the upper lip and down on to the lower lip, you’ll find the curve of your fingertip prevents it from bleeding over your lip line. For a really matte finish, use a fluffy brush to push some translucent powder through a single ply of tissue on to the lips.

He gave them his coat, he gave them his water bottle and, most importantly of all, he gave them what his team could not at Old Trafford on Monday: victory. It was the only offering that mattered for the United manager at Turf Moor.Romelu Lukaku struck twice to condemn Burnley to a deserved defeat and spark the post-match reaction from Mourinho that he recently claimed was not his style. United were superior in all departments and strong in their response to the 3-0 home defeat by Tottenham but there was unnecessary drama en route to the three points. Marcus Rashford received a straight red card within 10 minutes of coming on for pressing his head into Phil Bardsley and Paul Pogba had a penalty saved by Joe Hart. After the events of recent weeks, Mourinho will consider these minor drawbacks.The only sound during a respectfully observed minute’s silence for Jimmy McIlroy, the late Burnley legend whose funeral was held at Turf Moor on Friday, was the drone of a plane circling overhead. “Ed Woodward a specialist in failure” read the banner trailing behind it, the protest paid for by a United fans’ group called “A Voice from the Terrace”. The voice from the away section at Burnley was loud and unified as the travelling support chanted Mourinho’s name throughout.United’s manager acknowledged the welcome show of support, although even his most ardent admirers must find it bewildering that a coach who has enjoyed so much success from a solid, defensive base has a centre-half pairing of Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelöf in his third season at the club. Of course, it would have been different had Mourinho got his wish for a new central defender in the summer but, with Lindelöf and the substitute Eric Bailly bought on his watch, the blame cannot be pinned entirely on United’s vice-chairman.Fortunately for those wearing garish pink, Burnley lacked the pace and quality to stretch the United defence as Tottenham did at Old Trafford on Monday. In Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez, the visitors also had the strength and ingenuity to continue Burnley’s difficult start to the new campaign.Sean Dyche made four changes to the team that exited the Europa League at the play-off stage against Olympiakos on Thursday. The search for fresh energy and the defensive discipline of last season was fruitless, however. Burnley have not won a game inside 90 minutes since April, a sequence that now stands at 15 matches, and they were on the back foot from the first whistle here as United controlled possession and the tempo of the contest with ease. Jesse Lingard had three shots at Joe Hart’s goal in the opening 10 minutes alone but was unable to find the target. Burnley’s reprieve only ever felt temporary.Sánchez has struggled to justify United’s heavy investment so far but showed here what an influential figure he can and should be for Mourinho’s team with a commanding display on the left. The breakthrough stemmed from a delightful cross by the Chile international who collected Luke Shaw’s pass outside the Burnley penalty area and swept the ball with the outside of his boot over the head of Ben Mee. Lukaku, taking a crucial step away from the Burnley defender, was perfectly placed to beat Hart with a powerful close-range header.Lukaku almost doubled United’s lead minutes later following an incisive one-two with Sánchez but the former Manchester City goalkeeper produced a fine save to thwart the Belgium international. The Belgium striker did get his second of the game, and third of the season, when fortune favoured the visitors on the stroke of half-time. United can argue they merited the break after a fine flowing move saw Shaw and Sánchez link up once again to find Lukaku in the box. Lukaku teed up Lingard for a shot that struck Charlie Taylor, rebounded off the head of Ashley Westwood and dropped perfectly for the No\u0026nbsp9 to sweep under Hart.United were comfortable without illuminating Turf Moor. This was a victory built on industry and flashes of inspiration from Sánchez rather than a great leap forward in performance, although the margin of success should have been far greater. The visitors were awarded a penalty for Aaron Lennon’s clumsy challenge on Rashford as the substitute attempted to turn inside the area. Paul Pogba approached the spot-kick with a slow, hesitant run but his effort was telegraphed for Hart who saved comfortably to his right. The routine looks cool when it ends with a penalty converted but self-indulgent and ill-advised when it does not.Composure deserted United in the minutes that followed, not least when Rashford invited his red card by foolishly pressing his forehead into Bardsley having been fouled by the Burnley right-back. The former United defender was undoubtedly the instigator of the flare-up, kicking out at the young striker off the pitch, but Rashford gave referee Jon Moss no option but to reach for red. He had been on the pitch for only 10 minutes.Hart had a fine game against his old Manchester rivals and Lukaku in particular. He foiled the £90m forward again after he had brushed aside Mee to power into the penalty area. Lukaku also escaped both Mee and Hart only to be caught by the defender’s covering challenge and a possible push, but two late headers from Sam Vokes apart, United eased to an eventful, crucial and potentially restorative win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b2f716ea0a8b53a138bb7fa8681da428773f5d/190_184_4632_2780/master/4632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e96f31731fac4b825ccb62f002f74a","title":"watford tottenham premier league match report","story":"Mauricio Pochettino could not contain the frustration. The Tottenham manager had spent much of the time since last Monday’s 3-0 win at Manchester United warning his players that they could not be taken in by the result.There was a difference, he said, between the perception that Spurs were flying and the reality that they could just as easily have lost at Old Trafford. They had not played well in the first half. The bottom line was that they had to impose themselves from the first whistle against Watford and remain strong throughout.The message rang hollow after Spurs played, to quote Pochettino, as if the first half were a “friendly” and, after they had been handed the boost of a freakish Abdoulaye Doucouré own goal, they proceeded to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.In short, as Pochettino made clear, Tottenham cannot be considered as Premier League title contenders on this evidence.His angst was Watford’s joy. They had been even worse in the first half, having attempted to match their better-heeled rivals in footballing terms. But they found the fire in their bellies after they fell behind. They bullied Tottenham on a couple of José Holebas set pieces, with first Troy Deeney and then Craig Cathcart meting out the punishment with fine headers.“It’s so painful to concede two goals like we did and it’s so painful that the first half looks like a friendly,” Pochettino said. “We needed to go out there like a lion. But it was like: ‘OK, we play football, we play football.’ Show aggression!“When you score, you keep going, playing the same way but we started to change and play long balls. Then we conceded two goals that if you want to be a contender, you cannot concede. You need to show your strength. The reality is that if you want to be a contender, today we needed to win. And win easily because everything was ready to win the game.“We need to show more respect to this competition and compete much, much better. It’s difficult for me to understand. It was very painful. I think it’s a good wake-up call for everyone.”Watford’s best-ever start to a top-flight campaign goes on and they will now have the international break to bask in what they have achieved. Having beaten Brighton, Burnley and Crystal Palace, they knew that Tottenham would represent a test from a higher level. Despite being below their best until the Doucouré blunder, they passed it.“We just went away from our game,” Deeney said. “We tried to out-football them and made silly mistakes. But we cause people problems, we are big lumps and people don’t like it.”Deeney is one of the biggest lumps and he helped to spark Watford after the own goal. Having won a shuddering shoulder-to-shoulder challenge with Davinson Sánchez, he crossed and Toby Alderweireld’s ing header back across his own goal beat Michel Vorm only to come back off the top of the far post.Watford sensed there was something in this for them and their goals were marked by more than Holebas’s fiendish delivery from first a free-kick and then a corner. Deeney and Cathcart simply wanted it more than their markers who, it had to be said, resembled a sorry bunch.The first half was dull, with Tottenham in control but never truly stretching Watford, despite the occasional flickers from Lucas Moura and Dele Alli. The latter looped a header off target after fastening on to a high Alderweireld ball, with Ben Foster off his line, while he also threatened when Christian Eriksen whipped in a cross following a short free-kick routine. Alli touched wide and he was relieved when the offside flag went up.There was just one shot on target before the interval and it was entirely reflective that it was a tame pea-roller from Deeney in stoppage time. He had earlier headed over from Daryl Janmaat’s cross.The breakthrough goal followed an Alli chip into the box and a poor clearing header from the otherwise impressive Christian Kabasele. It reached only Lucas on the right and what followed seemed to unfold in slow motion. His cross was cut slightly backwards of square it thumped into Doucouré, who was running back to goal, and spun inside the near post, agonisingly out of Foster’s reach.Watford roused themselves in spectacular fashion, igniting the atmosphere in the process. Andre Gray snatched at an opening from the edge of the area and, after Kabasele had cut out a low Harry Kane cross with Lucas in space behind him, Watford drove the comeback.Tottenham almost snatched a draw at the end when Kane hung in the air to meet Kieran Trippier’s cross only to head high. It was not Kane’s day. Nor was it Tottenham’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5588fb60bef281482a0910da5ca8682df8c746ba/528_256_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d63904a6e9b767d5b22f6dde3bd454","title":"more mourinho mithering and saido berahino scores football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Lars Sivertsen to discuss Mourinho (again), Carabao Cup action, Declan Rice’s international dilemma, Hal Robson-Kanu’s international retirement and flesh-eating ratsJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

With a national fertility crisis mushrooming, and our status as a global leader in scientific breakthroughs threatened, there has never been a worse time for Britain to be shut out of the sperm\u0026nbsploop.As a diehard Remoaner, the troubling statistics piqued my interest. Perhaps I could exploit them to criticise Brexit? After a little late-night Googling at my laptop, I realised that, typically of overworked journalists who can no longer afford to cover anything in real depth, the Observer’s Andrew Rawnsley had only scratched the surface of the Danish semen story. The sperm crisis ran far deeper than even Rawnsley imagined and over the last week I have become the Carole Cadwalladr of sperm.It’s not a coincidence that, in 1969, liberal Denmark became the first country to legalise pornography, including with animals (nb it’s banned now). The vast proliferation of sexually stimulating material available, from everyday vanilla through to the strongest chocolate andor strawberry flavoured imagery, soon made the cake- and Lego-loving land the international capital of\u0026nbsponanism.Indeed, throughout Scandinavia, the act of solo sexual gratification is still euphemistically known as “going for a Danish” (in Swedish, “går till en Danska”, in Norwegian “går til en Dansk” and in Finnish “menee tanskaksi”).To give you some idea how deeply the notion of the Danes as lonely self-pleasers is embedded in Scandinavian culture, the popular 1970s Swedish satire show Pappa Olaf’s Karneval Av Idioter included a famous sketch, voted the funniest joke of all time in a recent Swedish poll, where a foolish Norwegian visitor to London becomes angry when he is offered a Danish pastry by an effeminate cockney baker.At first, commercial Danish sperm production was a small-scale affair. In the 70s and 80s, Danish sperm, packed in heavy, thick glass test tubes, was most commonly used as a mildly profitable ballast in the hold of their cargo ships. These Danish “semen-både”, as they were known in the shipping industry, mainly carried more profitable Danish products such as bacon and fish bits to Europe, the semen subsequently sold on to collectors and enthusiasts for minimal return once the more commercial products had been disposed of.But it was inevitable, as even the socialist Scandinavian states fell under the spell of the capitalist doctrines of Reaganomics and Thatcherism, that sooner or later the great national Danish pastime would be monetised. By the end of the 80s, Denmark was the unchallenged world leader in the business of commercial human sperm production. The Danish “sperm-salg” industry became a major concern, swiftly nationalised under the Dansk Sperm-Salg I Hele Verden banner and employing tens of thousands of men in the manufacturing process.Hans Thrigger Andersen is a wiry 50-year-old who enjoys the life of a comfortable flâneur and he FaceTimed me from the jazzy countercultural enclave of Aarhus on the Jutland peninsula. It was easy to understand why Hans’s sperm donor directory profile pictures have, over the years, seen millions of British couples clamour\u0026nbspfor his sperm above that of most other Danish\u0026nbspdonors.As a younger man, Hans, who is one of a small handful of full-time sperm-donating Danes, had the hard-rock angel good looks of Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, and he’s aged to sport the same rugged Viking charisma evidenced by the Canadian standup comedian and woodcutter Tony Law. It’s a ludicrous coincidence that Hans’s parents met in 1968 at an early Aarhus performance by Pekka Airaksinen’s experimental Finnish band Sperm, and conceived him that very night, but he dismisses any idea of environmental determinism as deftly as he evades my attempts to inculcate him into the second referendum narrative.Despite the damage it will do to his livelihood and lifestyle, Hans is an unlikely champion of Brexit. “Listen, I have spent my life lying on my back like a lazy hog. Brexit will force me to make something of myself. Same as maybe it will for Britain. The kitten is out of its sack, man. You make nothing and you can’t feed yourselves and all your fruit is picked by Latvians. Sure, in the short term, we are both taking a heavy cash hit, but maybe Brexit will make us get our shit together.”I tried to press Hans further on exactly what he meant but he had a daily quota to meet. In the short time we spoke, the tired Dane had already given me food for thought. If a man whose precarious lifestyle, predicated as it is on an endless cycle of continual self-abuse, can rationalise the destruction Brexit will wreak on his career as an opportunity for self-improvement, maybe it’s time for all of us here in Britain too to move on and embrace the no-deal uncertainty as a chance for a new\u0026nbspbeginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb82dd1011e99c7d55f360adc2b75a1595cb8c8a/0_437_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cafbc960a10cd308158f4039ef16b84a","title":"more loose women than newsnight bbc launches politics show for digital age","story":"Politics Live, beginning on Monday, has been inspired by US talkshows such as Morning JoeInside the BBC’s Millbank Studios, just across the road from parliament, final dress rehearsals are taking place for the launch of Politics Live: the BBC’s attempt to answer the question of what a daily political television show should look like in the era of social media.Guests sit around a table in a bright, buzzy studio influenced by the US TV political show Morning Joe. Activists and journalists, who have been drafted in as pundits for the rehearsal, get stuck into passionate arguments that will never be broadcast. Every so often a klaxon goes off to signify a breaking news tweet, while the host, Jo Coburn, debates with producers whether a camera angle is flattering.“It’s going to be more discursive and conversational,” she says in between rehearsals. “We are still going to scrutinise the politicians, but there are different ways of doing this.”Part of this is a recognition that there are now “more people and a more erse range of people” interested in politics than before – even if they don’t care for the ups and downs at Westminster.Coburn, who will be hosting the lunchtime BBC2 programme four days a week, says this could mean that the show chooses to focus on policies that spark public debate rather than following every government announcement on issues such as Brexit: “Whether it’s animal rights or marijuana oil, these are things people feel they have got something to say about. Maybe we won’t relentlessly follow every incremental change in a way that we might have done.”The new show – a replacement for the longrunning Daily Politics, produced by most of the same staff – launches on Monday with guests including Amber Rudd and Emily Thornberry. The change is partly a result of BBC budget cuts and partly a recognition by the broadcaster’s new head of live political programming, Rob Burley, that the format needed a rethink – especially as Twitter increasingly shapes the political agenda, potentially decreasing the need for appointment-to-view programmes.“Our inspiration is US programmes like Morning Joe, but also things like the sensibility of podcasts, where people have time to talk about things a bit more,” says Burley.Making a politics show during the 2000s and early 2010s was a simpler task because there was a relatively settled perception of political debate – and people often weren’t that interested anyway. Coburn refers to Andrew Neil, who will host a weekly extended Politics Live edition centred around prime minister’s questions: “Andrew always used to make the joke that people aren’t talking about this down the Dog and Duck. Well, now they are.”During the rehearsal there are nods to the changing times – guests have been given reusable plastic cups to replace the Daily Politics’ branded mugs – but the debate remains focused on policy, even if the chatty guest format now has more in common with Loose Women than Newsnight.When Politics Live was first announced, there was speculation that it was an attempt to attract younger viewers. Given television’s ageing demographic, that really means aiming to increase the number of people watching who are under the age of 65. With this in mind, films for the programme will be packaged for distribution on social media, making it partially a vehicle for creating online content.Other politics shows are taking a similar tack. The Sunday political shows – traditionally a source for Monday newspaper stories – have already had their own mini-reshuffle: Robert Peston’s ITV programme has switched to a midweek slot after failing to dent Andrew Marr’s morning viewing figures, the BBC has cancelled Sunday Politics altogether, and Sky’s Sophy Ridge changed to an early 9am slot in a bid to steal a march on the BBC.“Television news to me is feeling a little left behind … the way we present our product hasn’t been moving,” says Deborah Turness, the former ITV News boss now working to relaunch the satellite station Euronews for US media giant NBC. “We need to discover a new way to engage all audiences. That does mean we need to respect and reflect all viewpoints nationalists and populists and those on the liberal side all together.”Her station is launching its own Brussels-based daily programme called Raw Politics on Monday. The nightly show – which will combine political interviews with a pan-European phone-in programme – has booked Tony Blair, Nigel Farage and Yanis Varoufakis, alongside Jimmie Åkesson, the far-right leader in Sweden and associate of Steve Bannon.“As the people of Europe move in any given direction, it is our job to not filter out any viewpoint,” she says, pledging to give a voice to “inconvenient or uncomfortable” views that don’t fit with the perspective of liberal journalists. “This isn’t a platform for bigotry, this is about looking at where we can agree and build consensus.”This plays into the persistent criticism of broadcast political coverage, namely that even as the old certainties of British political journalism have been challenged by the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the rise of Jeremy Corbyn and the Brexit vote, political programmes have continued to draw on a relatively small pool of pundits.Back at the BBC studios, Burley says that while “previous iteration of the Daily Politics was very much of the traditional Westminster world”, the new programme will be looking to bring in guests from outside the traditional boundaries. But it is unclear where the line should be drawn – should figures with large online audiences, such as those associated with the alt-right and conspiracy sites such as Infowars, appear?“We have to be careful when we’re talking about views that are quite at one end of the spectrum, or are controversial,” he says. “There’d have to be a very good editorial reason as to why.”Politics Live will be broadcast on BBC2 every weekday at 12.15, with a longer episode from 11.15 on Wednesdays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61c3d286b4ad8517a7a6f400600872b65edb3b94/0_553_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b5e9e8009553dec4a37a643fa35e705","title":"troye sivan bloom review my my my","story":"No other song this year has inspired more unbridled joy than Troye Sivan’s My My My!.

Businesses have to be careful not to use too many parts of Britain in their vehicles in the future.”Brussels has, until now, raised questions, in public and in private, about the UK government’s vision on trade after Brexit, but fallen shy of its outright dismissal.But speaking to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper during a visit to Germany, Barnier did not hold back.The European commission official said there were overlapping interests in the fields of security and foreign policy. In response to the 100 pages of the UK’s white paper, the EU offer on the future trade deal would likely only come to “15 to 20 pages” due to a lack of common ground on the economic relationship, he suggested.“I am often accused in the United Kingdom of being dogmatic,” Barnier told the newspaper. “In fact, I only fulfil our fundamental interests.”Under the Chequers deal there would be a “free trade area for goods”, under which the UK would in effect retain existing regulatory and customs arrangements by becoming a rule-taker.In order to avoid border checks, Britain is also seeking a “facilitated customs arrangement”. The UK could control its own tariffs to allow it to pursue an independent trade policy, but its customs officials would collect and pass on the higher EU tariff to Brussels for goods passing through the UK en route to the continent.May’s de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, has recently said the Chequers proposals would protect both the British and European economies from damage, and is the only alternative to a no-deal scenario.However, Barnier has seemingly ruled out any such arrangement, insisting that the only option that could maintain something like the current economic relationship would be to follow the Norway model, under which there would be free movement of people and large payments to Brussels.Barnier said of the UK’s customs proposals: “We cannot relinquish control of our external borders and the revenue there to a third country – that’s not legal.“By the way, infringement proceedings against London are ongoing because, according to the commission, Chinese textile imports have not been properly cleared.“Moreover, the British proposal is not practical. It is impossible to tell exactly where a product ends up, on the UK market or in the internal market. For example, sugar is transported by the tonne in 25-kilo sacks, so you cannot trace every sack to its destination. That would only be possible with insane and unjustifiable bureaucracy. Therefore, the British proposal would be an invitation to fraud if implemented.”He said the “common rulebook” idea in the white paper did not reflect the modern world of trade.Barnier added: “The interest of Europeans is to preserve the integrity of the common market. That is our special strength and the reason why we are respected throughout the world, even in the United States.“As a former minister of agriculture, I can tell you that agricultural products are created under laws governing hygiene, health and environmental issues in the production process. There are services in every litre of milk and every apple.“We must therefore prevent unfair competition if the United Kingdom has weaker legal requirements than we do. Otherwise we would discriminate and weaken our own companies.”British and EU negotiators are due to re-engage this week, following six hours of talks on Friday between Barnier and Dominic Raab, the UK Brexit secretary. However, EU sources said the substance of the Chequers deals was effectively “history” as far as Brussels was concerned.Barnier said in his interview, published on Sunday: “By the way, the British have a choice. They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU – but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice.“But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits. That would be the end of the single market and the European project.”Responding to Barnier’s remarks, a UK government spokeswoman said: “We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU. “This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that. “Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/359476f9bfc7579da44f82acbe396e4b0e10f6de/0_135_5145_3087/master/5145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e46e5003dc2a76ed1346e430e1f3a00f","title":"england india fourth test day four match report","story":"The series is won the side that has spent much of the summer in a disturbing state of flux, sometimes drifting into ominous turmoil, can celebrate taking an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series after a riveting 60-run victory over India.Trevor Bayliss, the champion coach of one-day cricket, is no longer a clown when overseeing a Test team. Joe Root is no craptain. Indeed he calmly kept his hand on the tiller on Sunday from the moment he gave an articulate interview to Sky’s Nasser Hussain before 10am to when Ravichandran Ashwin was the last Indian batsman to fall at 5.20pm.When England are still in the game after three days they are a dangerous side. They seem to relish the tight finishes. The experience of the opening bowlers comes into play as they exert relentless pressure against anxious batsmen on a wearing pitch the senior men hold their catches and in this instance Root kept a fine grip on the situation in the field.But the matchwinner in his first Test of the summer was Moeen Ali, who took four more wickets to add to the five he snared in the first innings. On Sunday, he dispatched the two batsmen who caused England prolonged anxiety, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. This was a sensational return to the side by the most popular of England cricketers inside or outside the dressing room. It was also a reminder of the virtue of picking players in excellent form in Championship cricket. The constitution of England’s best Test side remains a curious conundrum but Moeen is now most definitely in it again.There were a few uneasy moments for Root and his team on a sun-kissed day. Their overnight lead was extended by only 11 runs and, although the rest of the morning went almost perfectly for England, there would be stern resistance from Kohli and Rahane that took India to within 123 runs of victory with seven wickets remaining.England’s senior pacemen were on top of their game from the start of India’s innings as three wickets fell within 10 overs. KL Rahul received a treacherous grubber from Stuart Broad, which glanced the bottom of his bat before thudding into the off-stump. Then Jimmy Anderson struck twice. Cheteshwar Pujara was lbw and Shikhar Dhawan well caught in the gully by Ben Stokes.Despite this early success for the fast bowlers Moeen was introduced for the 13th over and it was soon evident why. There was a loose patch of turf just outside the right-hander’s off-stump, which prompted the ball to turn significantly, and Moeen would hit it with impressive regularity. However, he needed to be patient, which he has sometimes found tricky in the past. When Kohli was on nine he was taken on the pad and England reviewed without much hesitation. The third umpire, Joel Wilson, swiftly decreed that the bat had feathered the ball but he declined to check whether the noise had come from the bat flicking the pad, much to England’s disappointment. Given the original not-out decision, perhaps Wilson’s premature call was justified.After the break England reviewed against Kohli in similar circumstances. This time the ball, though bound for the stumps, had struck the pad outside the line. England were out of reviews and Kohli and Rahane found a way to progress. They were watchful, skilful in defence against Moeen and prepared to advance via singles if necessary. There were few free runs to be had even when Root allowed Adil Rashid seven overs in the afternoon.It may seem a puzzle that Moeen should be used so much more than Rashid but this made perfect sense in these conditions and may well be relevant to the winter’s Sri Lanka tour. When the ball is gripping, as it is bound to do in the first Test in Galle in November, the finger spinner can find turn easily enough he is usually more accurate and quicker through the air than the average wrist-spinner. That explains the dominance of finger spinners such as Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera in Galle. Likewise Moeen was always the better bet here.Kohli had just tapped gloves with his partner to acknowledge a century partnership when he fell to Moeen. The previous delivery had been hit into Cook’s ankles at short-leg but now the ball ballooned in the air after brushing Kohli’s glove. This was England’s solitary scalp in the afternoon session but Kohli’s departure in this series has always been a decisive moment. Panic is never far away among his colleagues and, sure enough, India subsided from 123 for three to 184 all out.After tea Stokes had Hardik Pandya neatly caught by Root at second slip – a desperate captain always wills them in. Out came Rishabh Pant, who was determined not to perish in a hole as was the case in the first innings. There was a flamboyant six from the first ball he faced from Moeen another four soon followed but then, after much juggling of the field, Pant was caught on the cover boundary, scything away.The adhesive Rahane was lbw on the back foot to another turner from Moeen, after which the only resistance came from Ashwin, who was bound to attack extravagantly with the tail he plundered 25 before falling to Sam Curran, who had a surprisingly quiet day by his current standards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883348022bca9be27b90abbf1888fabadeb74385/0_413_2128_1276/master/2128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a3d51e8e9122708be550aa7863eb170","title":"lewis hamilton wins italian grand prix vettel","story":"Before the Italian Grand Prix began Lewis Hamilton had described the hostile atmosphere at Monza as a “snake pit”. By its close he stood atop the podium telling the partisan and booing crowd how he had revelled in drawing energy from their negativity. His positive spin was entirely understandable from a win that had looked almost unthinkable when he took to the grid until he put in what he said was “up there” with his greatest drives.The elation with which he leaves Monza was in stark contrast to the visible deflation of the massed tifosi but Hamilton will take away so much more having delivered an absolutely stinging blow to Sebastian Vettel.His victory hinged on three decisive moments of overtaking and a peerless, ruthless piece of strategy from his Mercedes team. Vettel, who finished fourth and now trails Hamilton by 30 points in the title race, was involved only once and his misjudgment cost him any chance of the win and may have derailed his championship challenge. For the fourth time this season he made an error under pressure.The Ferraris had been quickest all weekend and Hamilton had acknowledged the task. He started from third on the grid, behind Kimi Räikkönen, on pole, who was ultimately second, and Vettel. The three were clean together through the first chicane but Hamilton took a tow through the Lesmos and was able to go round the outside of Vettel into the Roggia chicane. Hamilton left him room but the German took too much kerb and chose not to back off and concede the place. They touched and Vettel spun, sending him back to 18th. Just as in Baku, France and Germany a single incident proved costly.Shortly afterwards the second key moment could not have been more apposite. After a short safety car period Hamilton overtook Räikkönen on the start-finish straight but gloriously the Finn hit back immediately , coming back round the outside of Roggia with a great piece of late braking to retake the lead. It was exactly as Hamilton had done to Vettel but this time with both drivers exiting the chicane cleanly.Finally, after Mercedes had kept Hamilton out for a long time so he had fresher tyres at the end and had used Valtteri Bottas, who finished third, to hold Räikkönen up on track, the battle for the lead fell to the British driver as he pulled off an inch-perfect pass on the Finn round the outside through the Retifillo chicane with eight laps to go. It was enough to secure victory, albeit once again to the disappointment of the tifosi.It had been against the odds and against the head. Ferrari have enjoyed a pace advantage since the British Grand Prix. Asked afterwards if it was one of his greatest drives, Hamilton believed it was. “Under the sheer pressure that we are under I definitely will consider it to be quite far up there,” he said. “Especially to do it on Ferrari’s home turf as well, with such a difficult crowd and so much pressure on the team with the performance that they have, to really be able to pull a little bit more out of the bag and really make it stick.”Vettel made an admirable comeback through the field, battling a damaged car, but insisted he had not been at fault. “I guess Lewis saw his chance but he didn’t leave me any room,” he said. “So I got spun around and couldn’t avoid what happened.”1 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 1hr 16min 54.484sec 2 Kimi Räikkönen (Fin) Ferrari 1:17:03.189 3 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1:17:08.550 4 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:17:10.635 5 Max Verstappen (Neth) Red Bull 1:17:12.692 6 Romain Grosjean (Fr) Haas 1:17:50.804 7 Esteban Ocon (Fr) Force India 1:17:52.245 8 Sergio Perez (Mex) Force India 1:17:53.162 9 Carlos Sainz (Sp) Renault 1:18:12.624 10 Lance Stroll (Can) Williams at 1 Lap 11 Sergey Sirotkin (Rus) Williams at 1 Lap 12 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Sauber at 1 Lap 13 Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel) McLaren at 1 Lap 14 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Renault at 1 Lap 15 Pierre Gasly (Fr) Toro Rosso at 1 Lap 16 Marcus Ericsson (Swe) Sauber at 1 Lap 17 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas at 1 Lap.Fastest Lap: Kimi Räikkönen 1min 23.515sec on Lap 28.Yet his argument feels thin. Hamilton pointedly noted that he and Räikkönen had engaged in an identical exchange successfully. “It was a racing move, the same manoeuvre that Kimi did to me,” he said. “We are supposed to be racing and I left him space.”His racecraft is in possibly the best form of his career but Mercedes also managed his race with precision. They have been guilty of poor calls this season but in the intensity of Monza there were cool heads. They thought well on their feet regarding the stops as the race evolved and their use of Bottas was as successful as it was clinical. Ferrari, in contrast, may consider they might have been better served giving Vettel the best shot at pole on Saturday, which may have seen him away from Hamilton’s clutches on the opening lap.For the British driver, however, his remarkable run at Monza continues, with his fifth win here, equalling Michael Schumacher. The German scored all his for Ferrari, whose fans continue to wait for a driver to return such heady days to the temple of speed. But for Hamilton it is a win that bodes only well. The last three occasions he has won in Italy, he has gone on to take the championship.Max Verstappen in the Red Bull was in fifth. The Haas of Romain Grosjean was in sixth, in front of the two Force India’s of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez. Carlos Sainz in the Renault was in ninth with the Williams of Lance Stroll scoring his team’s second top ten finish of the season in tenth. Daniel Ricciardo was forced to retire with what appeared to be another engine failure on lap 25.After a protest by Renault the floor of Romain Grosjean’s Haas was found to not be in compliance with regulations and he was disqualified. Which means Haas return to fifth behind Renault in the constructors’ championship and Williams’ Sergey Sirotkin is awarded tenth place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290020937925d938088151b5f3a44b40c31a6f2a/38_67_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9ee96b4a8b70beca5031e60ccc61fca","title":"newcastle saracens premiership match report","story":"It may be the start of a brand new season but for Newcastle this was a particularly frustrating case of deja vu. To describe the Falcons’ historic success rate against Saracens as modest is a sizeable understatement and, predictably, the visitors left the north east with a 20th consecutive victory over their hosts in all competitions.By no stretch of the imagination, though, could this be dismissed as a routine contest, containing as it did a notable array of “You are the Ref” moments, which fundamentally shaped the outcome. Despite being reduced to 13 men at one stage, Sarries took advantage of two of these pivotal decisions to secure an unlikely bonus-point victory, which featured a couple of tries for Alex Lewington on his league debut for his new club.The Falcons’ director of rugby, Dean Richards, has been around the game long enough to know luck evens itself out over the course of a long season. Even so, he felt the game could have panned out differently had the referee, Ian Tempest, not twice favoured the visiting side: once when he adjudged Richard Wigglesworth had not knocked the ball on prior to Nick Tompkins’ match-clinching late try and again when he denied Niki Goneva a try because, he said, the Fijian winger had acted contrary to the spirit of the game.This is not an everyday occurrence indeed no one present could recall a comparable precedent. Goneva had caught an attempted Owen Farrell drop-goal in his own in-goal area and, with his back turned, appeared to the naked eye to have touched it down for a 22 restart. All of a sudden, however, he turned and sprinted around a nonplussed, static Sarries defence to claim a score at the other end. Video replays confirmed he had merely touched the ball down on his toe, rather than the ground, but Tempest dismissed Newcastle’s appeals, pointing out he had already blown his whistle to signal a 22.Full marks are always due to anyone daring to be different but, with the ball having been ruled dead by the officials, Goneva’s cunning plan always had a fatal inbuilt flaw. Richards, however, made the valid observation that throwing a dummy is perfectly legal and suggested the referee should have penalised the big Fijian if he thought an offence against the game’s values had been committed. “I am amazed he didn’t go to the TMO and come back and have a look at it, which is probably the right thing to do. That’s what the TMO’s for.”Saracens’s Mark McCall, however, made the obvious point that the second the referee blew his whistle the game was technically at a halt. “Assuming the referee calls a 22m dropout – and he did – I think our players are entitled to stop,” said McCall. From the north Londoners’ perspective, the loss of both wingers to injury and the champions’ ability to survive final-quarter yellow cards for both Tompkins and Alex Goode deserved some tangible reward.With six minutes left and Saracens still down to 13 men, however, nothing was remotely certain when the Falcons’ international back-rower Mark Wilson was driven over by his pack for his second try of the day and Toby Flood slotted the conversion to put the home side within a point at 22-21. The Falcons had played fitfully up to this point but, suddenly, the force was with them.Cue Wigglesworth not being penalised for a fumble at the base of a scrum, causing some Newcastle players to lose concentration momentarily and allow Jamie George to burst clear in midfield. Tompkins, only just back on the field, applied the finishing touch, to the disgruntlement of Newcastle fans who felt he should have seen red not yellow for a forearm to the head of Flood. If Owen Farrell’s conversion and subsequent penalty made it look an easy ride the reality was slightly different.If truth be told, though, Saracens do not edge these type of games by accident. George had earlier shown exceptional handling skills to gather and touch down in the right-hand corner, a slimmed-down Will Skelton was a constant menace and Farrell looked in excellent nick for this early in the season. Lewington, the last remaining fit specialist winger after Sean Maitland dislocated a finger and David Strettle failed a HIA, displayed the sure finishing knack for which Sarries signed him and Billy Vunipola is set to be available for this weekend’s home game against Bristol. Last season’s champions will take some knocking off their perch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ae205c38fb7df075d9c142b9fab308aa4414d8/0_414_4592_2756/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d05bf02a9618ad492e4839c4f9b475e9","title":"swimming fjords mountain hiking norway scandinavia wild camping","story":"The last leg of his Scandi tour takes Kevin Rushby to Norway. On this odyssey, he’s discovered the best things – swimming in fjords, spectacular hikes, wild camping – are free• Scandi tour: part 4, part 3, part 2, part 1Heading west from Åre by rail, we watch the forest and softly rounded fells roll by, all the way up to the border town of Storlien. I’m with my daughter, Maddy (15) and we’re intrigued at this crossing point: a forlorn old railway station in the high wilderness along the Swedish-Norwegian border. With twilight stealing in, we switch trains and set off, charging downhill into Norway.We pass through a town called Hell and then reach our destination: Trondheim. As we leave the station, we find the city immediately captivating, its gorgeous waterfront lined with wooden ships, old warehouses and several interesting museums. Even at 10pm, there are teenagers leaping into the sea off the jetty, people skiing down the streets (on rollers) and tourists from far and wide. We hear their accents at breakfast: American, Italian and Japanese – all very excited. By now, Maddy and I are deeply attached to sumptuous Scandinavian breakfasts. I even manage some brunost, sweet brown cheese, a Norwegian speciality normally put out to repel visitors.With only a few hours in town, we join a tourist office walk around narrow streets of painted weatherboard houses and an impressive cathedral that features an angel sculpture modelled on Bob Dylan. We collect our hire car at noon and drive off, vowing to return. We have two days to cover the 300km to the city of Ålesund.We follow the coast, swinging around long fjordsand stopping to swim in one, where we meet a Danish couple who have bought a log cabin. “Some like luxury,” they say, “but we are off-grid. Water from a well, one log-burner for all the heat and cooking. In summer we swim in the fjords in winter we do cross-country skiing.”It sounds idyllic to me.Our destination on day one is the small island of Håholmen, reached by a necklace of other rocky outcrops all connected by elegant bridges, part of Norway’s impressive Atlantic Road. On the last leg we take a wooden boat across to the island, a small outpost of fishing cabins which explorer Ragnar Thorseth has converted into a hotel, Havstuer Håholmen. A small museum houses his boat, the Saga Siglar, a traditional longship that in the 1980s he sailed to Greenland and on to America, emulating the voyages of Leif Erikson in the 10th century.Maddy and I clamber out to the end of the island and swim for almost an hour, marvelling at the fact that we are a mere 400km south of the Arctic Circle. Night never really falls, just a glowing twilight inhabited by midges. We retreat to the restaurant, where the carpaccio of whale might thrill some visitors, but not us.Next morning we drive to fjord-side Åndelsnes, where we take a footpath out of town up a steeply wooded hill. After a couple of hours we emerge at Rampestrecken, a dizzying viewpoint over a confluence of fjords. After the soft confined landscape of Sweden, with its endless forest, this is shockingly three-dimensional – even more so when we continue up the bare mountainside to Nesaksla, a tiny stone bivvy hut at 715 metres. I don’t think I’ve done a finer hike.It’s evening by the time we reach Ålesund, another island settlement with a great waterfront. The town was destroyed by fire in 1904 and rebuilt in Nordic art deco: floral designs and geometric motifs sprinkled with trolls and snakes. The restaurant on the hill offers a fine panorama, but there are cheaper alternatives for dinner: such as the good fish and chip kiosk by the waterfront. Molo brewery, by the cruise ship terminal, is also worth a stroll. We kayak around the waterfront and take a cruise out to the sea eagles and puffins. The best things in Scandinavia, however, are often free. My highlight for Ålesund was our one-hour hike up Sukkertoppen, the highest peak on the seven islands that form the town. There we lie on sun-warmed granite boulders, surrounded by vistas of islands.My Scandinavian odyssey is reaching its end. The stand-out moments have been when wild camping, and I’d say anyone worried about the cost of Scandinavia should pack an affordable tent and a stove. Wild camping is free, and simply the best. Sweden’s Bohuslän archipelago had clean beaches on uninhabited islands filled with berries, and endless evenings undisturbed by anything but the sound of the birds. Our mountain bike trip around Vålådalen, also in Sweden, provided a similar thrill, this time with the added excitement of catching Arctic char in a crystal clear lake at dawn.In Ålesund, Maddy and I can’t bear to leave the wilds. On the way to the airport, we ert to yet another island and take one last swim in the kelp beds offshore. As we do, an eagle swings by to take a look and then, deciding we are inedible, heads on towards the horizon, where other islands await.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

But New York had a fringy answer.Wigstock is back. The festival of drag fashions, sequins, stilettos, big hair and, in almost every conceivable way, Burning Man’s opposite, has sprouted up in Manhattan for the first time in years.More than a decade since it was last staged, the new iteration of Wigstock, “is back in NYC as the hormonal convergence issues in the age of asparagus,” its original founder in the eighties, Lady Bunny, explain, tongue firmly in cheek, to the  on Saturday.But which of the two should be interpreted for greater cultural significance is open to question. The New York festival, held on a pier at the south end of Manhattan on Saturday afternoon and into the wee hours, is promising a cavorting extravaganza from the who’s who of drag and outré cabaret acts in the city. Bianca Del Rio, Lypsinka, Joey Arias, Justin Vivian Bond, Murray Hill, Sherry Vine and Amanda Lepore will all be there among 50 drag acts, all wrangled by veteran drag queen, comic and activist Lady Bunny.“New York has become increasingly corporate and dull,” said Bunny, aka Tennessee native Jon Ingle, who started the ball rolling in 1984. It began then with an impromptu, late-night performance by drag queens in Tompkins Square Park, in a part of Manhattan known as Alphabet City, for a captive audience of homeless people who lived in the small park. Over time it faded out and more recent revivals have had mixed success.“But rather than whine like the jaded scenester I am, I prefer to throw a wiggy, end of summer bash event to add something entertaining, hopefully annually,” said Bunny, who is known for her high, high, teased blonde wigs and corny humor.She added: “The Wigstock festival did not yet curl up and dye!” Two thousand, six hundred miles away in Black Rock City, Nevada, tens of thousands of Burning Man festival goers on Friday night watched as two wooden trains collided amid a series of explosions. The festival’s pyrotechnic events were ringed by wardens in an effort to prevent a repeat of last year’s fatal tragedy in which 41-year-old Aaron Joel Mitchell, 41, ran into the Burning Man effigy.Wigstock was a little more down home, a more folksy celebration in the age of drag-as-mainstream-TV and queer and trans equality – and yet a pointed demonstration against isiveness and bigotry in the age of Donald Trump’s presidency (rather than asparagus). There was a nod to commercialism, of course, it’s not quite post-modern. Wigstock is a ticketed event on the roof, no longer a free for all under starry skies. It was organized not only by Bunny but by prominent actor Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka.Wigstock is legendary, emerging during the Aids crisis and the backlash against gay pride. The title, obviously, is a play on Woodstock, after the iconic hippie music festival in upstate New York in 1969, the same summer the Stonewall riots in the city sparked the gay liberation movement.He was not wearing drag on this occasion, just an amazing hat of denim dreadlocks. Nikki Exotica, a self-described trans pop star, was sporting a long dark wig, furry cat ears, a mask and a latticed, rubbery skirt over a thong, with high heels. She said: “I’m so excited to be here. We’re bringing the nineties back. But now it’s about inclusiveness and that’s what being trans is about.”Lady Bunny wore a psychedelic dream frock and a wig stretching about two feet off the top of her head.  The most memorable New York Wigstock in history was when Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery performed All You Need is Love, which culminated, impossibly, with him “giving birth” to his assistant Nicola, who had been hiding all the while upside down in his flamboyant costume. “The year that Leigh Bowery came out was the best,” recalled Kim Hastreiter, fashion stylist and co-founder of Paper, an independent pop-culture magazine. According to Hastreiter, Wigstock emerged from the Pyramid Club, a tiny bar on Avenue A at the corner of Tompkins Square Park that was the nocturnal home to fringe drag acts by the likes of Ru Paul and Joey Arias, and bands like Deee-Lite and Ultra Naté, the artist Taboo and fashion designers Marc Jacobs and Stephen Sprouse. “It was all about kids and young people just going wild. I don’t know if they were on acid or what, but if was definitely psychedelic. Many were performers or into art and the fashion was fantastic,” said Hastreiter.But the effect was longterm. Bowery became known as a forerunner of extreme body modification, while Pyramid Club drag act Ru Paul Charles went on to turn drag into unthreatening education-cum-entertainment for middle America with his award-winning TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race. Neil Patrick Harris, star of the recent revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch on Broadway, promises a tribute this year to Aretha Franklin, whose funeral was on Friday. The Queen of Soul will be played by drag queen and contestant on Ru Paul’s show, Latrice Royale.Harris shot wigs from an air gun into the crowd. Peppermint, another star of Ru Paul’s Drag Race, lip synched. The roof top crowd lapped it up. Feather headdresses and erotic dancing came as standard.So forget the laminated-cards, wrist bands and wealthy tech exclusivity that Burning Man has become, says Lady Bunny.

Twenty years ago – before a commodities boom made China Brazil’s top trading partner – ties between the two were negligible and few Chinese students studied Brazil’s official language, which has more than 220m native speakers worldwide. Today, record numbers are doing so, wagering it will guarantee them work as diplomats, interpreters or lawyers for Chinese ministries or firms in the Lusophone world.“There’s a saying: ‘Learning Portuguese will help you find a good job, with good pay!’” said Sun, a second-year student at China’s leading language school, the Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU).There has also been an explosion in the study of Spanish – spoken in many Latin American nations – with about 20,000 Chinese undergraduates in 2016 choosing the language, up from just 500 in 1999, according to official figures.Margaret Myers, the head of the Inter-American Dialogue’s Asia and Latin America programme, said more and more Latin America departments were opening in China because of a Communist party push to foster regional experts. “In the past five years we’ve seen … centres open all over the place, from Wuhan, to Tianjin, to Zhejiang – you name it,” said Myers, who wrote a recent report on the trend. Many of China’s Portuguese graduates still end up in African countries such as Angola, Mozambique or Cape Verde, where Beijing has a well-established presence. But as Beijing’s Latin American footprint grows, they are increasingly looking further west.“Brazil is a country of possibilities,” said Zhang, from Zibo in Shandong province, who is halfway through a four-year degree at BFSU. Zhang, 20, admitted the 17,000km (10,600 miles) between Beijing and Brazil meant his knowledge of Latin America’s largest economy had yet to expand far beyond the cliches. He painted it as a resource-rich “melting pot of different races” and admitted most students knew only about its football.Sun, from Handan, 440km south of Beijing, has also yet to visit but has been swotting up on Brazilian politics from afar. “A lot of corruption, I have to say!” she said of the “Car Wash” scandal that has engulfed Brazil’s political elite. “I thought it was very funny how this big thing happened and the president had nothing to do with it!” Brazilian culture left a better impression. “Every time I watch it, I will cry,” Sun said of her favourite film, Walter Salles’s Oscar-nominated Central Station. After initially struggling with Portuguese phonetics she had also fallen in love with a language that showed her “a culture which is different from Chinese culture … more optimistic”. If China’s growing sway in Latin America is a boon for students, for Washington it is a worry. Myers said the US had longstanding misgivings about Beijing’s motivations and now considered China one of three key regional concerns, alongside migration and the Venezuela crisis.Fuelling those anxieties is the region’s possible inclusion in the Belt and Road initiative (BRI), a $1tn (£760bn) Chinese infrastructure spree critics say is partly a pretext to lure smaller countries into Beijing’s orbit. US fretting intensified last month when El Salvador became the third Latin American nation in just over a year to switch its diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China – a decision the White House denounced as “of grave concern”. Myers said Washington’s reaction reflected its fading regional clout: “Between the BRI and the Taiwan switches, China’s presence and influence is really alarming people in DC.” Beijing has tried to soothe such fears. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, recently claimed China did not seek to “move anyone’s cheese” in Latin America. But while most experts describe Beijing’s Latin American interests as largely economic, some see a growing strategic military threat. Chinese Portuguese students have security concerns of a different kind. Sun plans to visit Brazil after graduating, but will stick to São Paulo, one of the safer corners of a country that suffered a record 63,880 homicides last year. “Other cities are a little bit dangerous for me.” Zhang said a teacher recently told him of a friend whose Rio home was invaded by burglars while she was studying. According to Zhang’s account, the student asked her Brazilian assailant if she could finish her homework first. “The robber was quite friendly actually,” he said. “But the final result was that he took her computer.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816f5f457d4c6aa50c114ee1f29ce3b963d0944c/0_52_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11e2415cb0acc295cc33d098ad4f36aa","title":"too soon rehabilitate louis ck mockery metoo","story":"Last year Louis CK went from routinely being referred to as one of the world’s greatest living standups to being outed as a sexual aggressor a predator who was both frightening and pathetic in the way he used his power to repeatedly masturbate in front of female comics without their consent, and then in effect killed their careers for talking about it. Last week, nine months since he was forced to admit that rumours circulating for years about his behaviour were true and promised he would “step back and take a long time to listen”, he made a comeback at New York’s Comedy\u0026nbspCellar.His 15-minute set – an unannounced drop-in according to the club’s proprietor – was reportedly given a standing ovation. It didn’t include any of his trademark self-flagellation, no acknowledgement of the mess he has made or the crushing disappointment he has become to the many fans still reeling from processing the transformation of Louis CK, champion of women onstage, to Louis CK, grotesque harasser of women in reality.He did, however, include a joke about rape whistles. And just like that, without any public contrition, without ever saying “sorry” even in his sole statement on the matter back in November, Louis CK audaciously joins a line of disgraced, powerful men – including news anchors Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer, comedian Aziz Ansari and actor Jeffrey Tambor – reported to be readying a showbiz rehabilitation without making any apparent effort to have a personal one.Next month marks a year since the #MeToo movement went fully mainstream. More than a decade since Tarana Burke created it on the activist fringe, a wellspring of trauma and anger has been unleashed. Women, as we know, are still learning to articulate the abuse they have suffered. And those same women, as proved by Louis CK’s victims alone, are still dealing with the consequences of further aggression and harassment once they do.As a culture, we are still reckoning with an unprecedented but seismic societal shift that means the conversation is no longer “just” about criminal acts of rape and assault the spectrum of unacceptable behaviour being discussed includes the aggressively bad dates, the unchecked misogyny, the casual sexist bullying, the scale of male entitlement that allowed so much of this to slide for so long.That this debate is largely being shaped by the entertainment industry seems an additionally bad joke: we are relying on the likes of, say, Matt Damon to “get it”. Worse, the discourse is influenced by their publicists, briefing their clients to parrot platitudes on the subject of #MeToo in every interview, or to avoid it\u0026nbspaltogether.The fragility of the movement was demonstrated further by last week’s news that one of its most prominent activists, Asia Argento, who accused Harvey Weinstein of rape, covered up an allegation that she had slept with an underage male actor. As a society, we unrealistically expect our victims to be perfect it becomes difficult to understand that the importance of #MeToo can be separate from the actions of those fighting hardest for it.And yet. Instead of increasing our understanding of how sexual abuse works and of how we internalise sexism, of how we become better and make progress, we are grappling with the question of whether it’s too soon for Louis CK and a bandwagon of fallen male “heroes” to write off their worst behaviour and stage a form of image\u0026nbsplaundering.Is nine months of seemingly pottering about his Manhattan apartment long enough for Louis CK to be left out in exile? If not now, ask his defenders, when would it be OK? Who is to decide what form public retribution should take? If you don’t like it, argues the same crowd, don’t buy tickets to see him. (That Louis CK arrogantly and unexpectedly forced himself on last week’s audience is by the by.) The argument here broadly amounts to: let the moral clarity of the free market decide. After all, in the case of Kevin Spacey, this resulted in box-office takings of $126 (£98) for his newest film, Billionaire Boys Club, on opening night last month.But what can we learn from a man so recently revealed to have indecently exposed himself and showing little remorse for it? What is his impetus? Louis CK always joked in his sets and throughout his shows about being a schlubby, disgusting, masturbation-obsessed loser. It is no longer funny, so what now?Like fellow comedian Ansari, whom I interviewed about his book on modern romance and self-proclaimed feminism, Louis CK hasn’t really acknowledged a problem. The detailed account of a date with Ansari which was published online earlier this year was embarrassing and terrible in every sense: both because he appeared to be so tone deaf and awful with women and because, like Louis CK, the persona he has projected and profited from seems so distinctly removed from his real-world personality.There hasn’t been any admission of therapy or counselling, no sit-down interview in which either man has been challenged, and nothing in their actions to suggest that there is regret for what they have done, bar being caught out.If comedy purports to equal tragedy plus time, and if nine months still seems a wildly long period for his career to be on hold, consider Louis CK’s arc in the first place: he made his standup debut at an open-mic night in Boston in 1985. It took him two more decades on the circuit until he was rewarded with a coveted spot on an HBO comedy special. It took another 10 years before he became the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden three times on a single tour. Taking less than a year off at the peak of his power barely counts as a break.This rush to rehabilitate the alleged fallen heroes of #MeToo isn’t simply distasteful, it is indecent. For the longest time, the kneejerk has been to argue that the art must be separated from the artist. But what thought for all the art that might have been created, if the canon wasn’t so committed to protecting “flawed” artistic genius instead?#MeToo isn’t looking to retrospectively destroy all that came before but to understand and learn from it so progress might be achieved. The consensus remains that so many of history’s great but morally dubious artists, from Caravaggio to Picasso, are products of their time. Allowances are made because “it was different back then”. By that same token, let’s remember that Louis CK et al are products of this time. Male abuse of power cannot fly now. That time is up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/348343b5fe31027d739b7c036f665ea556bc3029/0_184_3683_2211/master/3683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44ae206c3cca511e5e2bc10a5937f639","title":"nauru a nation on the cusp of democratic calamity","story":"Judges have been sacked, opposition politicians jailed and citizens’ rights eroded. Human rights advocates say there has been a breakdown in the rule of law on the Pacific islandAs Marise Payne stands in her colourful shirt for the obligatory photo opportunity at the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru this week, she might do well to consider the high price Australia pays to prop up one of the most dysfunctional governments on the planet.As the newly minted foreign affairs minister, the arc of Australia’s influence in the Pacific is now Payne’s bailiwick, and Nauru is a country, it seems, edging closer to the cusp of democratic calamity.Economically it is beholden: Nauru survives essentially on Australian largesse and self-interest.In 2017-18 the Australian government directly provided two-thirds of Nauru’s entire revenue of $170m either as direct aid, resettlement and visa fees for refugees, fees to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre Corporation, or reimbursements to Nauru’s government.That’s before the $26m in taxes on high earners – paid mainly by Australians – and the airfares and charters on Nauru Airlines, the only way to reach the island.The economic relationship is one of client state and patron, in the view of many, but it is Australia’s publicly uncritical support for Nauru that is proving damaging.Australia’s moral authority as a champion of robust democracy and good governance in the region is taking a battering. By turning a blind eye to the disintegrating rule of law and flagging democracy in Nauru, Australia has abandoned the role of role model.While New Zealand has withdrawn aid for the judicial system in protest, Australia continues to pump ever more funds into Nauru.Since 2013 there have been multiple sackings of judges and magistrates who displeased the Nauruan government.Opposition politicians have been arrested and jailed, Nauru citizens have had their passports cancelled and Australian staff who raise concerns about the welfare of refugees and asylum seekers with Nauru authorities have been summarily deported.The organisation Australian Human Rights Lawyers says the breakdown of the rule of law and the withdrawal of the right of appeal to the high court of Australia affects both Nauruans and people seeking asylum who were sent to Nauru by Australia. They now have no options for challenging decisions in the Nauruan legal process.“It is critical that any court, especially the highest court in a national hierarchy, protects its processes from abuse by the executive arm of government,” says the ALHR president, Kerry Weste.“Australia should implore Nauru to comply with the rule of law and ensure that it is not in any way complicit in undermining the structures and institutions that are required for a fair and functional justice system on Nauru.”Meanwhile a whiff of suspicion hangs over the current ruling elite. The Australian federal police has confirmed to  Australia that an investigation into bribery allegations involving the president Baron Waqa, the justice minister David Adeang and a Gold Coast phosphate company, Getax, remains ongoing.As the Pacific Islands Forum kicks off, another crisis in the judiciary is looming. Adeang stood up in parliament on 15 August to effectively threaten the Australian judge Geoffrey Muecke, who had been brought in to hear Nauru’s most controversial case, known as the Nauru 19 case.“Maybe we have to deal with Justice Muecke first,” he told parliament, arguing the court’s decision in favour of the Nauru 19 over legal fees would cost the government money.The Nauru 19 are facing charges over an anti-government protest – the government terms them riots – outside parliament more than three years ago. The protest was itself sparked by the last round of expulsions of expatriate Australians who filled the most senior court roles on Nauru.Mathew Batsiua is a former foreign affairs minister of Nauru and has been a parliamentarian for nearly 15 years. His electorate is the seat of Boe, in Nauru’s south-west. He shares the electorate with his fiercest political opponent: president Baron Waqa.Batsiua was an opposition MP and a leader of the protests in 2015 after he was suspended from parliament for giving interviews to the media. He is now one of the highest profile of the “Nauru 19” defendants and says Nauru’s democracy has been “seriously undermined” over several years.“At the core of it is the erosion of the rule of law and the overpowering of the other two arms of the government by the executive,” Batsiua tells  Australia.“We saw the alarming and blatant interference of the judiciary in early 2014 when the executive sacked and immediately deported the then magistrate, Peter Law, because they disliked a particular decision he made at that time. When the then chief justice, Geoffrey Eames, intervened and ordered the deportation to be stayed, the president directed the commissioner of police to disregard the chief justice’s orders and to continue with the deportation. The president then cancelled the chief justice’s visa, effectively … forcing his hand to resign.New legislation has curtailed fundamental freedoms: Nauruans must now seek police permission to hold a peaceful assembly or demonstration. It is also unlawful to criticise government policies or actions if the government judges that criticism might incite political hatred.In addition the post of “assistant minister” has swelled the ranks of the government to 12, meaning the executive outnumbers the legislature in the 19-member parliament. The government can, effectively, pass laws unchecked.Batsiua says Nauru’s international reputation has suffered as a result. He says the government’s “closed-shop” approach regarding its role in Australia’s offshore processing regime had done the country no favours.“If there was some access allowed then some of the positive stories would have formed part of the complete picture and balanced the negatives out there,” he says. “For our part Nauru has provided a centre that allows people with claims for asylum to have these claims processed and determined. Those found to be genuine are granted refugee status and are treated as such and given protection. Many have found their footing in Nauru and have forged some normalcy during this transit phase of their lives.”  Australia sent detailed questions to the Nauru government but received no response.In March, Geoffrey Muecke, who served as chief justice of the South Australian district court for 19 years, was brought in to hear the Nauru 19 case. In June he ruled the government should pay for their legal representation.The Nauru 19 defendants have been relying on assistance from lawyers mostly from Australia, who have been working on the case for free.In the interests of a fair trial, Meucke ordered the government pay $US166,600 in legal fees.He also ruled that the Civil Procedures Amendment 2018, which was introduced after the Nauru 19 applied for legal aid, was unconstitutional because it aimed to severely limit the opportunities for people facing criminal trial to obtain representation and funding.The Sydney solicitor Christian Hearn is one of a team of Australian lawyers who have represented the Nauru 19 pro bono over months. He says that mounting a defence had been a “challenging process”.“As the case has progressed we have seen the parliament respond to developments in the case with unconstitutional legislation. On several occasions Nauruan government lawyers have suggested our actions as defence lawyers are in contempt of court,” Hearn says. In the wake of Muecke’s ruling, justice minister Adeang – widely seen as the power behind the throne in Nauru – rose in parliament to express his outrage, referring to the lawyers by the disparaging term “white ears”. “What the court says and also those children of the white people from overseas, the lawyers who really care for and look after them. For some reason these foreigners from overseas have very different values. They seem to have some different views to us, we who say that these people are guilty and they are giving us the runaround because they are scared to start.”He issued a media release, saying the government would not comply with the judge’s orders because “the government was not a party to the proceedings … so it could not lawfully comply with any orders that were made by the judge for payment”.He warned the Nauru 19 would be locked up and the government would pursue them for debts with the money to benefit the people of Nauru.Batsiua says the “direct threat” made against the country’s chief justice by Adeang is an archetypal example of an executive government without check or balance running roughshod over the country’s democratic institutions.“This behaviour is typical of the government’s attitude to … anyone that does or says something that is critical or against what the government desires. This lack of tolerance of opposing or different views is a direct threat to our democracy and the rule of law in Nauru.”This is not an isolated incident.In December 2016 Nauru’s resident magistrate Emma Garo failed to get her contract renewed amid controversy over allegedly lenient sentences she gave to three anti-government protesters involved in the same incident as the Nauru 19. They pleaded guilty.Adeang had earlier warned in parliament that judges should be careful about being too lenient, suggesting their contracts may not be renewed.She has now returned to the Solomon Islands where she has been appointed chief magistrate.Nauru’s prosecutor appealed the sentences to the Nauru supreme court and the three defendants had their sentences extended – in one case from three months to 22 months.When the trio appealed to the high court in Australia, then Nauru’s court of last resort, the high court sent the matter back for resentencing. Their sentences were extended further by the Nauru courts.A further appeal to the high court became impossible when the Nauru government announced in April 2018 that it was ending a 44-year old arrangement for the high court to be the avenue of last appeal for the Nauru justice system.Nauru says it is part of its journey to independence. The new appeal court, announced in July, will be staffed by judges from the Pacific Islands but it is not yet operating.ALHR says Nauru is in the middle of a rule of law crisis.“Every country needs an appellate system. Nauru has removed the high court without establishing an alternative. The treaty termination seems to have been designed to deprive certain people of appellate rights,” Weste says.The Nauru 19 have now filed for their case to be permanently stayed. It will be determined by Justice Meucke on 13 September – just after the Pacific Islands Forum. In the mean time the government says it will appeal Meucke’s rulings on legal aid to its new court of appeal.It is not just the judiciary who have drawn the ire of the Nauruan government.In 2013 the Nauru commissioner of police, a former Australian federal police officer, Richard Britten was deported. He was well advanced with an investigation into alleged kickbacks from an Australian phosphate company, Getax, to Nauru’s president, Baron Waqa, and the justice minister, Adeang, at the time of his sacking in July 2013.The ABC has aired footage showing emails that purport to record payments to Adeang.Nauru’s former solicitor general, Steven Bliim, also an Australian lawyer, tells  Australia he had been involved in drafting the request for assistance to the United States authorities in order to just get confirmation from Hotmail of the authenticity of the emails.“After that request was made, and as I understand it was submitted by Richard on behalf of the police, I heard nothing further about it,” he says.A few weeks later there was a riot at the regional processing centre and Britten was stood down and eventually left the island.Bliim resigned in 2014 in protest at the sacking of Peter Law.While the Nauru-based investigation into the Getax case appears to have stalled since Britten left, the AFP is still investigating because of the Australian connection.A spokeswoman confirmed to  Australia that the investigation is ongoing.Expats who work on Nauru repeatedly mention that the local community are extremely reluctant to criticise the government or its policies, because almost all Nauruans work for the government or government companies or have relatives who do.All news comes via the government newsletter or the state-owned television station.But criticising the Nauru government also comes with hazards for expats as well.Retaliation against contractors who report welfare issues is a major concern among Australians now working on Nauru – even when they remain within the official reporting structures.Six staff from Canstruct, the company which has taken over delivery of welfare and garrison services associated with Australia’s regional processing centre, have been shipped off the island since December.The company has refused to comment as have the Nauru and Australian governments. But  Australia has learned that the expulsions followed formal complaints about a man who is now working for the government of Nauru’s Regional Processing Centre Corporation (NRPCC) in a senior position, who claims to have protection of a government figure.The complaints involved allegations of abuse of a child and possible breaches of child protection legislation.The expelled workers were bound by mandatory reporting requirements and would have taken their concerns to the government of Nauru’s child protection authorities.But in doing so they appear to have jeopardised their own employment and had their visas removed by Nauru authorities.The first incident is believed to have involved an assault on a child and this was reported to the Nauru authorities. The second incident involved the Nauruan community which had raised child protection concerns about the welfare of young girls. Welfare staff urged them to take their concerns to the government of Nauru child protection authorities.Soon after the welfare staff were expelled.Part of the Canstruct brief is to build capacity within the NRPCC so it can take over the functions filled by Canstruct as early as October this year. That will effectively see the Australian government providing a multimillion dollar contract to NRPCC to provide welfare, maintenance and garrison services to asylum seekers and refugees who cannot be sent to another destination. That is likely to be several hundred people, who might be in the country for up to 20 years."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615948.1535911922!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"church of ireland archbishop refuses to dissolve greystones school board","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChurch of Ireland Archbishop Michael Jackson has refused to dissolve the board of management at a primary school in Greystones, Co Wicklow. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The The Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin has refused to dissolve the board of management at a primary school in Greystones following protests by parents over controversial admission policies.His intervention follows the resignation of a long-serving principal at St Patrick’s National School in protest over a policy that prioritises the enrolment of children who regularly attend church services.Parents at the school last week overwhelmingly voted to back the principal and urged the board be dissolved at an extraordinary general meeting of its parent-teacher association.In a statement, Archbishop Jackson - the school’s patron - acknowledged that while St Patrick’s was facing challenging times, there was no evidence that the board was “dysfunctional”.“There will be many occasions where disagreements arise between board members and within school communities. However, disagreements in and of themselves are not evidence that a board of management is dysfunctional,” he said.“In this instance, while the patron is aware that there are many different points of view, he has not been provided with any information that would indicate that the functions of the board of management are not currently being effectively discharged.He added: “The Church of Ireland ethos of the school and decisions made by the board of management in the past remain unchanged. The board of management will continue to manage the school and the school will continue to educate the children entrusted to its care.”Dr Jackson added that the current chair, Canon David Mungavin, has asked for a temporary break from the duties of chairing the board. He is being replaced by Canon Adrienne Galligan. In response, the parents’ subcommittee of St Patrick’s parent teacher association expressed its regret that the patron had not responded to its request to discuss ways of resolve issues at the school.“Respectfully, it is suggested that the patron might wish to hear from all stakeholders before making any decisions or public pronouncements in this matter,” the sub-committee said.“It would appear that he consulted only with the very board of management which was the subject of the no confidence motion overwhelmingly passed at the EGM.“It is difficult to see how the patron could have made a determination that he was ‘satisfied’ that the functions of the board were being effectively discharged without seeking the views, opinions and experiences of interested parties other than the board itself.”Another source of controversy at the school has involved a decision by the board to turn down an extra teacher the school was entitled to for the coming academic year.Some parents claim the move was to prevent school numbers growing and potentially diluting its Church of Ireland ethos.However, Dr Jackson said in a statement there was no reason to expand the school and this position was supported by a Department of Education statement that they would not build an additional classroom for an extra teacher.The parents’ committee, however, said its concerns were focused on the school’s enrolment policy.On the hiring of an additional teacher, it said there was “ample” capacity to accommodate an extra class, given that one classroom was empty and another was being rented out."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615771.1535901388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kerry greenway 197 landowners told of compulsory purchase orders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlmost 200 landowners in Co Kerry have been told that compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) will be used to acquire parts of their holdings as part of a plan for a 32km greenway for cyclists.  File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe .Almost 200 landowners in Co Kerry have been told that compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) will be used to acquire parts of their holdings as part of a plan for a 32km greenway for cyclists. Kerry County Council has lodged an application with An Bord Pleanála for the South Kerry Greenway, which will be along the old Great Southern railway line. The line, which closed in 1960, was not kept in public or rail company ownership. It runs between Glenbeigh and Renard, which is near Cahersiveen. In addition to the 3 metre wide paved surface for the greenway, car parks are to be constructed and old tunnels and bridges are to be restored as part of the project.The council said it has no choice but to force the sale after it failed to reach agreement over the past four years with all 197 landowners along the route. However, the move to use CPOs to acquire the land for the project has been criticised by inidual farmers and the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA), who view the proposal as unprecedented and a test case for all farmers.The council argues that the greenway would be “a key economic driver” for the area along the route, where the population is falling. The project has been voted into the county development and local area plans, the council said, which means there is an obligation on management to progress it.The CPO, published on Friday involves 222 pieces of land measuring between 0.001 hectares to over 0.2 hectares. Among the land owners affected are several public bodies including the council itself, Iarnród Éireann, forestry body Coillte as well as inidual farmers, some of whom own a number of pieces of the old line.Around 40 or so landholders are objecting to the route through their lands and want the council engineers to fix on alternatives. Signs saying “Greenway Yes, CPO No” have appeared along sections of the main Ring of Kerry. The IFA said farmers fear if Kerry County Council manages to acquire lands using the CPO – then other councils are waiting in the wings to do the same which could see farmers losing land for myriad minor purposes.They said the CPO process, which is permitted under the Housing and Roads Acts, should be reserved for major infrastructure projects."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Two Government ministers say they will boycott State events with US presidentGemma O\u0026rsquoDoherty mired in controversy over Veronica Guerin \u0026lsquoconspiracy theory\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoI was often sitting here for eight hours not talking to anyone,\u0026rsquo says one ownerBishop Deenihan said he was \u0026lsquoparticularly conscious\u0026rsquo of his role in supporting the priests of his dioceseControversy over school admissions policy which prioritises church attendanceNortherners\u0026rsquo pre-match nerves turn out to be justified as Dublin cruise to four-in-a-rowToyoko Inn has offered Dublin City Council \u0026euro14.5m for Sean McDermott Street siteCouncil says it has to force land sales after failing to reach agreement after four yearsFormer deputy chief constable of PSNI to sign Official Secrets Act and Garda Code of EthicsMove prompts anger among local commuters who say service is already over-crowdedFormer diplomat and UCD professor involved in the Irexit Freedom groupBelfast man sustained a serious lower arm injury while deep-sea anglingUN data show eight million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year, killing marine lifeMany areas dry at first but rain in west will spread to the east coast by eveningMotorcyclist (40s) killed on N24 in Tipperary pedestrian (38) killed outside TullamoreICCL calls for \u0026lsquoscrutiny\u0026rsquo of intelligence efforts as Drew Harris set to become commissionerCampaigners have long sought better infrastructure and safety measures for bike usersT\u0026aacutenaiste tweets that US president always welcome shortly before criticising his policy on Palestine"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3616014.1535915134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"as carrick on shannon shops close some blame hens and stags","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim Gartlan looks out the window of his shop, which closed on Friday. Photograph: Brian FarrellLast Friday the shutters came down on three town centre shops in Carrick-on-Shannon and locals spent much of the day dropping in with good wishes and cards. A fourth shop in the Co Leitrim town had said a final farewell to customers the previous day.Two of the businesses, Prior’s on Main Street and Gartlan’s on Bridge Street, were family-run newsagents that had survived for generations. Scented Meadows, a gift shop styling itself “the lavender experience”, opened in Carrick five years ago but, according to owner Nicoletta Pantano, she was closing for the sake of her sanity. “I was often sitting here for eight hours not talking to anyone, with no cars passing,” she explained.A children’s clothing store, Sherbet, also shut last week, although it is to continue as an online business. Three more businesses have either recently closed or are preparing to go.In a town frequently lauded in the tourist guides for its vibrancy and picturesque location on the banks of the Shannon, the closure of at least seven town centre shops is a talking point.There are two motions before Monday’s meeting of Leitrim County Council urging that something be done. “Is there some reason for these closures that we can address?” independent councillor Enda Stenson is asking officials, echoing the bewilderment locally at the scale of closures.The reasons are varied and complex, but the development of out-of-town retail parks and online shopping are being cited as factors. The proprietors of one popular boutique are closing for family reasons, while another boutique has little choice because the landlord is selling up.The impact of Carrick’s popularity as a destination for hen and stag celebrations ides opinion, with some saying it kept the town going during difficult times, while others believe the regular weekend influx of revellers is keeping other potential customers away.“Hens and stags bring €28 million annually to Carrick and create 800 jobs, including part-time work,” said Colm McGrath, president of the chamber of commerce. He agrees that seven shop closures is a cause of concern “in the short term, but medium to long term I think the future looks positive”. McGrath says that once funding is secured to improve the streetscape in Carrick, investment will follow.Fellow chamber member Leslie O’Hora does not share his enthusiasm for hens and stags. “We have a population of 4,000 but get an extra 1,000 every weekend, most of them well-behaved but some obviously boisterous,” said the businessman. “Families will not come into town if there are people marching up and down the streets carrying inflatables and bottles and glasses.”O’Hora, a business consultant and former Green Party election candidate, argues that only a handful of “superpubs” are benefiting from the hen and stag trade and says the same people provide accommodation and transport for the visitors. “It’s a beautiful town with fantastic hotels, 20 restaurants and some lovely boutique shops, but it is destroyed at weekends.”Jim Gartlan, who sold tourist souvenirs in his newsagent, points out that 13,000 people reportedly visit the Rosebank retail park on the Dublin side of town every Saturday.“People can get all they need on the edge of towns. It’s not just Carrick,” he said. His grandmother Eileen Murray started the business on Main Street in the late 1930s, a time when most families lived over their shops creating a close-knit town centre community.Gartlan says “a combination of 20 different things” including a sharp drop in overseas visitors, made closure inevitable.Colm Prior’s father, Denis, bought the business in 1953, “so after 65 years Prior’s is retiring”. Prior says the “last straw” for him was when the traffic flow was changed and commuters travelling from Leitrim and Drumshanbo could no longer turn right and pass his premises. “We were never consulted,” he said. “From the first day we saw a difference,” his partner, Bernadette Keenan, said.They had no problem with hens ands stags, especially hens. “They’d come in for coffee and to buy confectionery for the kids before going home on Sunday. The lads, in fairness, were here to drink,” laughed Prior.Claire McGovern, editor of the Leitrim Observer, believes there are multiple reasons for the spate of closures, including traffic issues. “The town is well known for being a bottle-neck as motorists cross over the bridge, and this can put off people coming into Carrick.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615919.1535910806!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dubs hail best ever team while neutral fans cheer for tyrone","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Flight attendants Megan La Salle from Philadelphia and  Christy Parks from Delaware soaking up the All-Ireland atmosphere in the Big Tree pub.

Photograph: Conor PopeThe man selling the white four-in-a-row baseball caps outside Croke Park breathed a sigh of relief as the second half of the All-Ireland final drew to a close and Dublin maintained their lead. “Here, look at this” he said, turning one of the caps inside out. Just about visible under the heavy plastic sticker rejoicing in Dublin’s fourth triumph in as many years was another sticker welcoming Pope Francis to Dublin. “I’m selling these for a mate,” he explained. “I sold all me Pope hats last week. But he would have been screwed altogether if they’d lost.”In truth, apart from a 10 minute spell at the start there was little chance of that happening and most of the people outside Croke Park before throw in knew it. Sandra Norton from Scotland was confident as she prepared herself for her first All-Ireland final in an absolutely jammed Big Tree pub in Drumcondra, hosting its last All-Ireland final party before closing its doors ahead of a major redevelopment. “I’ve never had a ticket before,” she told The . “This fella always gets one but not me,” she said gesturing to her husband Niall. “Football has always been big deal for us,” she continued. “In fact on our first date he took me to see Dublin play Laois. And we had to be on the Hill for a semi-final two days after we got married so never got our honeymoon.”Her husband Niall, from Walkinstown, was unapologetic. “Well we can’t miss the big games can we,” he said. “I wouldn’t say I’m overly confident but Dublin would have to be really bad for Tyrone to win and I can’t see that happening”. Eamonn White from Castleknock agreed. As he spoke he rooted in his bag for two balloons with the number four on them. “I’ll be blowing these up later for sure,” he said, denying he was being complacent. Sort of. “Am I counting my chickens? I don’t think so. Well if I am we own the chicken farm so we do.”While Tyrone fans in the pubs and on the streets around Croke Park were in good spirits they were fearful. Clusters in the Big Tree spoke nervously about the game. “If we can just get a goal early,” one told his friends. “If we can get just get a four or five point lead,” another said. “Dublin have never had to chase a game.”Maeve McBride was dressed red and white and just before the match started she was optimistic. “Well we definitely have a chance,” she insisted. “I’ll be gutted if we lose.”An hour before the start, the touts were doing grand. The  followed one to see just how business was. She bought a ticket from a man draped in Tyrone’s colours and paid him €40. Just 15 seconds later she sold the same ticket to a Dublin supporter for €80. As she plied her lucrative trade, an almost entirely naked man painted in blue danced nearby. There was a line of people waiting to pose for selfies with him. He was Shane Peppard from Clondalkin. “ I’ve been doing this since 2013, it’s my thing,” he explained. He wasn’t the only photographic draw. On a baize-covered table stood the Sam Maguire, or at least an exact replica. People posed for pictures holding it aloft. “ That’s my fruit bowl normally,” said Sandra Murphy. “It belongs to my husband Darragh. He has loads of replicas and they’re all in my sitting room. “Normally we use it to raise money for the Crumlin Children’s Hospital but this year we just brought it down. It’ll be good for the poor Tyrone fans. They’re not going to have another go of it.” When the match started the pubs near Croke Park emptied but there was still a fair crowd in the Big Tree, mostly made up of Kerry and Galway fans who had travelled up for the minor final. They were all cheering for Tyrone.With 20 minutes played the northerners were 4 points ahead. Then Dublin got a penalty. “No way was that a f**king penalty. He ed,” the neutrals screeched. Dublin scored another goal to a sound of anguished howls from the Big Tree “neutrals”.“It’s over now,” a lone a Tyrone fan said disconsolately. “They must be the best team ever and I’m not even joking.Soaking up the atmosphere in the Hill 16 pub on Gardiner St were a delighted Megan La Salle from Philadelphia and an equally thrilled Christy Parks from Delaware. The flight attendants had flown to Dublin from Washington hours earlier and gone straight into the city to savour the atmosphere. “We haven’t slept in 24 hours but are still delighted to be here watching the Dubs,” La Salle said. “It’s craic and it’s fun to be a part of such a big event for you guys.”Parks nodded as she sipped her pint of Guinness. “Of course we are supporting Dublin, I mean hello that’s where we are. We don’t really understand the rules but that’s okay , it’s nice to be involved and it really matters to lots of people.”It certainly mattered to Brendan Clark from Coolock who was sitting at the bar. “I don’t want to be cocky or anything by who can stop us winning now,” he said. “I mean Mayo can’t and Kerry can’t. We’re the best team ever.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3614338.1535738680!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"exploring the border a frontier marked by myriad crossings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Monaghan Way, near the border with south Armagh. Ninety-five of the Border’s 208 crossings are between Monaghan and its three northern neighbours, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh.There are more than twice as many border crossings in Co Monaghan alone as there are between Norway and Sweden, an international boundary much beloved of simplifying Brexiteers.If you include unmapped routes – sometimes no more than planks across a stream – Monaghan may even give the European Union’s entire eastern frontier a run for its money.When civil servants from Northern Ireland and the Republic finally agreed an estimate of the Border’s total number of crossings earlier this summer, a century after partition, the count came to 208, or one for every 2½ kilometres.Almost half – 95 – were between Monaghan and its three northern neighbours, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh. The figure dwarfed even the 59 counted for Donegal, and made the borders of Louth (33 crossings), Cavan (15) and Leitrim (six) seem unperforated by comparison.The Brexit-enforced task of counting them was described by officials as “almost impossible” because of confusions between public and private land, places where the Border runs up the middle of roads, and other anomalies. And there is no better place to see what the counters were up against than on the route between Cavan and Clones, where my own exploration of the Border began.Over a distance of 12km, you cross the frontier four times. But that’s only on the main road, the N54 (as it is in the Republic) and A3 (as it becomes on its brief visits north). Turn off this on to the many side roads to your left and right and you enter a maze that must keep bureaucrats and other lovers of order awake at night.Not long after I met the A3 for the first time, another interesting statistic appeared beside a gateway. “Do not cross this field unless you can do it in nine seconds,” read the warning notice, “because the bull can do it in 10!” There was no sign of the bull, although inviting as the field looked, with the river Finn meandering through it, I wasn’t tempted.A little farther on, in an unintended joke, services offered by a local business included “alignment” – the buzzword of Britain’s torturous Brexit negotiations. In this case, it was only car tyres they were offering to align.And, as a tourist on foot, my main concern with tyres was not getting run over by the traffic that hurls along here at, or over, the speed limits (80kmh in the Republic, 60mph – 96.5kmh – in the North, and both irrelevant to some drivers). Already, however, I was approaching the notorious Drummully salient, perhaps the single greatest challenge to cross-Border alignment, and happy for the excuse it gave to leave the main road.Like the hundreds of local townlands that share the prefix, Drummully gets its name partly via the Irish droim (“ridge”), from the drumlin belt that stretches across Ireland at this latitude. The proliferation of such Drums in south Ulster suggests marching – a connection Drumcree helped perpetuate. And there has indeed been a long-established tendency to mark territory in these parts.Just east of Drummully is a place with the even more martial name of Drumswords, where in 1828, in an incident known as “the rising of Burke”, an Orangemen of local infamy was hanged posthumously from a tree, several days after he had been buried in the local cemetery. But even allowing for the depth of political enmities around here, how Drummully ever became an international frontier is one of the deeper mysteries of partition.Sometimes also referred to as a “polyp” by map-makers, the area is a virtual exclave of Monaghan, all but surrounded by Fermanagh. The connecting isthmus is only metres wide: that sprinting bull could probably cross it in 10 seconds too. But there is no road into Drummully at the connecting point.On the contrary, direct entry from the Republic is cut off by the aforementioned river Finn, which uniformed gardaí have sometimes had to wade across to avoid the complications of road-based approaches, all of which pass through the North.Peter Leary, Fermanagh-born author of Unapproved Routes: Histories of the Irish Border 1922-1972, suggests Drummully was “almost certainly a ballybetagh”: an ancient unit of territory usually comprising 16 townlands. And however it ended up in Monaghan – almost but not quite gripped by two Fermanagh claws, like one of those toys in the amusement arcade game – it was clearly never designed to withstand the stresses of international border duty.Post-partition, farmers inside it suddenly had to cross the frontier twice en route to market in Clones, and the same on the way back. This was complicated even before the Northern authorities started cratering and “spiking” roads to block terror attacks. Meanwhile, the Church of Ireland in Drummully was now separated from its rectory by the Border, and in the confusion, for years, marriages went unregistered in Dublin.Regardless of personal affiliations, sane people on both sides of the political ide thought that either Drummully would have to be sent north by the 1924 Boundary Commission, or that the surrounding northern bits would go south. The commission took a long look at the area. Then events intervened, and the entire Border stayed where it was.So today, although the drumlins, hedgerows and even the road markings offer no clue of a change in jurisdictions, signs on the A3 suddenly welcome visitors in English, Irish and six other languages, including Polish, Japanese and Ulster Scots.These have been joined more recently by Brexit-inspired posters, including one erected by the 1916 Societies: “Hard Border? Soft Border? No Border!” Apart from those, the main road’s surest indication that you have crossed jurisdictions is a shop advertising “fireworks”, sale of which is illegal in the Republic.But even clues such as this disappear when you plunge into the network of boreens south of the N54. There, only the all-knowing blue dot on your iPhone map knows for sure which side of the Border you are, although once, when I thought I was in the North, I was surprised to encounter an old green post box, embedded in the pier of a farmhouse gate. The post box didn’t have a painted-over red crown. It was one of those rarities, with a harp: placed here after this bucolic backwater found itself promoted to frontier duties.Otherwise, speaking of backwaters, water is often the best guide to the Border’s whereabouts, even if this year’s long, hot summer had reduced some of the boundary streams to the status of underground rumour. But somewhere deep in Drummully the road I was on wound its way up to a dramatically humped-back bridge, with sturdy stone walls either side. And although the Border was nudging us from both east and west at this point, the blue dot on my phone placed me firmly in between, in the Republic.So what was this momentous-looking bridge in the middle of nowhere, with no water underneath and surrounded by dense vegetation? As I realised only subsequently, it must have been a ghost of the old Clones-Cavan railway line, long abandoned and now being reclaimed by nature.Back on the main road, much later, and after another brief and uneventful sojourn in the UK, I reached the outskirts of Clones, where a house bedecked with three different flags – the white and blue of Monaghan GAA, the Irish Tricolour and the green, red and black of Palestine – seemed to suggest we were in the Republic again.But no, not quite yet, according to the blue dot. The flags must have been erected by an exile living in what he or she might have called the “occupied territories”. For Clones too is hemmed in by the Border, which crowds it from three sides, with historically ruinous results for the local economy.Then, just north of the town, for reasons best known to itself, the boundary goes wandering once more, into a drunken S-shape, so that again you cross it several times in quick succession. While trying to make sense of its movements there, I noticed a young man get out of a car, set up a camera tripod in the middle of the road and take pictures of the tarmac.“Are you by any chance photographing the Border?” I asked him.And sure enough, he was, as a project for the Glasgow School of Art. We agreed the route was especially illogical around here. But there wasn’t much time to talk. He was a young man in a hurry, with many crossings still to photograph. I passed him again up the road, where he had already shot another piece of tarmac and was packing up the tripod once more before speeding away to the next rendezvous.By now, the fanciful notion I had started with – that this summer, in instalments, I might walk the entire Monaghan frontier – had vanished in the face of its awe-inspiring vastness.There were too many crisis-crossing detours, even on the official routes, not to mind such paths as the one Clones writer Eugene McCabe cut through a field once and called the “Khyber Pass” (as mentioned in another recent book, Hard Border – Walking Through a Century of Irish Partition, by McCabe’s nephew Darach MacDonald).So I left the hilly fastnesses of north Monaghan, Emyvale, Glaslough and Peter Robinson’s road to Clontibret for another time and instead, for the second day of rambling, crossed the county to the Border’s most southerly land extreme, near the village of Blackstaff.There’s not much to Blackstaff these days. But in the years before the 1798 rebellion, according to Samuel Lewis’s Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), it comprised “200 wretched hovels”, whose population elected a “mayor” annually to settle disputes. Even when the hamlet was “broken up”, after 1798, natives continued to hold annual reunions there for many years.Now it’s a quiet gateway into south Armagh, formerly known as “Bandit Country”. And if Jacob Rees-Mogg ever needs a crash course in Border studies, this might be the section I would bring him to, if only for the dog I met soon after crossing into Armagh.The old adage about letting sleeping canines lie was more than usually feasible during the hot weather. I tiptoed past several farmyards where watchdogs slumbered. Elsewhere I was grateful that, thanks to sheep and litigation, the more active ones are less likely to roam freely than dogs of 30 or 40 years ago.But this particular animal, of indeterminate breed, had been fitted with a muzzle. He was thereby at liberty to come out on to the road to growl at me, as I walked by. So muzzle or no muzzle, I passed gingerly, complimenting him on being an “excellent metaphor” for the fragility of the peace process. He kept growling until I was well clear of the property.There were more direct reminders than the dog of the Troubles here, including some elaborate roadside monuments to the Republican fallen. Their inscriptions can be elliptical. One on the Annaghad Road speaks of an IRA volunteer who simply “died near this spot” in 1996. Another at Cullaville commemorates an IRA man who, in contrast, was “murdered by criminals”.I was on the main road to Castleblayney then, still known as the “concession road” from its unusual legal status after partition. When the Border first descended, and customs officers wrestled with the challenges of one of world’s most dense rural road networks, it was decreed that only 16 crossings were “approved” for general use.The vast majority were “unapproved”, except for local farmers, doctors on call, people on foot or bicycles, and sometimes funerals (an exemption often said to have been exploited by smugglers). The “concession” roads, linking two parts of a jurisdiction but passing through the other, could be used for transit as long as drivers didn’t stop.But as Peter Leary reminds us, natives of Cullaville, being from Armagh, and wishing to travel the short distance northwest to ’Blayney in Monaghan, were legally expected to take the opposite direction, to Crossmaglen, then south into Louth, then double around on to the concession road, on which they too were required not to stop, even in their home village. The detour was about 45km. It was understandably unpopular, and gave way under mass protests in the 1960s.The concession road is another scary place to walk these days, thanks to traffic. So it was a relief to get off it again and follow the Border up along the shores of Lough Ross, itself a cross-Border body of water. Here you can abandon roads altogether for a while, thanks to one of Ireland’s lesser-known tourist attractions: the Monaghan Way.But the Border gets back to business, in every sense, when the L4400 meets the main Castleblayney-Crossmaglen Road. The actual boundary involved a short detour to my right there, and as usual was barely recognisable now except for a patch of tar repair.Beside that, however, was a walled-off business called Border Systems, a name that at first glance could be a hard Brexiteer’s fantasy. On closer inspection, the services offered were for purely private security: house alarms, CCTV, automated gates, etc. The frictionless Border technologies Brexit supporters talk of are at least as far into the future here, where nobody wants them anyway, as elsewhere.Meanwhile, another wall I passed on the road into ’Blayney carried a faded reminder of Troubles past: “Touts beware”.And nearby was an example of the “ordinary crime” (as it used to be called, to differentiate from the political) on which post-Troubles security systems are focused.A poster of a John Deere tractor, under the word “Stolen”, was fixed to a telegraph pole, with a reward offered for information. The notice added that the tractor had been “last seen in south Armagh”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Asuyoshi ChibaAFPGetty Images The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator has said he is “strongly opposed” to key parts of Theresa May’s proposals for a post-withdrawal trade deal.In a fresh blow to the UK prime minister’s plan, which triggered senior cabinet resignations and faces growing opposition from hardline Tory Brexiteers, Michel Barnier said a suggested “common rulebook” for goods would kill the European project.He told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: “We have a coherent market for goods, services, capital and people — our own ecosystem that has grown over decades. You cannot play with it by picking pieces.“There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40 per cent of the total value.”Mr Barnier also told EU car manufacturers they would have to use fewer British parts after Brexit in order to keep to tariff export rules.The comments came as former Brexit secretary David Davis branded Ms May’s Chequers blueprint as being “actually almost worse than being in” the EU.Mr Davis poured scorn on Ms May’s claim that she would not be “pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest” as that risked becoming an “an incredible open sesame to all”.He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “In my view, the Chequers proposal ... is actually almost worse than being in.“We will be under the rule of the EU with respect to all of our manufactured goods and agri-foods, that’s a really serious concession, what about take back control, it doesn’t work?“That actually leaves us in a position where they dictate our future rules without us having a say at all, so it’s a worse deal.”Earlier on Sunday Ms May said she would not compromise with Brussels over her plans for Brexit as a media report said rivals in her party were set to publish their own proposal calling for a cleaner break with the European Union. With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union, Ms May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a ided country.“I will not be pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest,” Ms May wrote in the Sunday  newspaper. “The coming months will be critical in shaping the future of our country and I am clear about my mission.”She also said she would not hold a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership, reiterating a long-held position in an attempt to counter increasingly vocal campaigning for another public vote on the terms of the orce.“To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy,” Ms May said.In another sign of cabinet tensions, international development secretary Liam Fox took a swipe at the treasury over gloomy predictions on the consequences of a no-deal scenario.He told the BBC: “Can you think back in all your time in politics where the Treasury have made predictions that were correct 15 years out, I can’t, they didn’t predict the financial crisis that happened, no-one could.“So this idea that we can predict what our borrowing would be 15 years in advance is just a bit hard to swallow.“To say what a GDP figure would be 15 years ahead is not a predictive power that I’ve known the Treasury to have in my time in politics ... I don’t believe it is possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions on GDP.”The comments followed reports that election strategist Sir Lynton Crosby, who masterminded Boris Johnson’s successful London mayor campaigns, is manoeuvring to derail Ms May’s EU withdrawal agenda with a co-ordinated national campaign.Referring to EU trade rules, Mr Barnier said: “Outside of the internal market and the customs union, this involves customs formalities and controls that hinder ‘just in time’ production.“In order for EU carmakers to benefit from the tariff benefits of the EU-Korea agreement, only a certain proportion of the services may be provided in a car in a third country.“Businesses have to be careful not to use too many parts from Britain in their vehicles in the future.”He added: “By the way, the British have a choice. They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU — but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is their choice.“But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits. That would be the end of the single market and the European project.” - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Two other guests evacuated from the hotel have contracted a shigella infection. Following the sudden deaths of a British couple at a holiday resort in Egypt last week, two of the  guests evacuated from the hotel where the couple were staying have said they have been infected with the bacteria Shigella.They were among some 300 guests evacuated from the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada following the sudden deaths of John and Susan Cooper from Burnley, Lancashire, who died within hours of each other.Samples tested in a British lab showed that the mother and her young daughter, from the north west, were suffering from infection with the bacteria, which can be transmitted through food or water. It is believed that they caught the infection while staying at the resort. Others are also thought to have been infected.Shigella - a group of bacteria similar to E. coli -  is a highly contagious and common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria causes the infectious disease known as shigellosis.There are four different types of shigella. Shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri are the kinds more commonly found in the UK.Shigella boydii and shigella dysenteriae are more common in developing countries - cases of infection with these types of the bacteria found in the UK tend to be among travellers coming back from holiday. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people who are infected with the bacteria develop diarrhoea, fever, and stomach cramps one to two days after they have been exposed. Mild cases of the infection usually clear up in five to seven days.Some people who are infected with shigella do not show any symptoms but they are still able to transmit the bacteria to other people.In more serious cases shigella can cause dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes bloody or mucus-containing diarrhoea.Shigella is highly contagious and it takes just a few of the germs to make someone sick. The germs are found in the faeces of infected people while they have diarrhea and for up to two weeks after the diarrhea has gone away.The germs are spread when someone touches their mouth with hands that have been in contact with the shigella bacteria or eats food with the germ on it. You can get shigella bacteria on your hands after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with germs from the stool of someone with the infection, eating food made by someone who has shigellosis, handling nappies of an infected child, swallowing infected water or having sexual contact with someone who is infected or is recovering from a recent infection.Shigella causes some 165 million cases of disease worldwide each year - mostly among children under five in less wealthy countries.Countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and Asia have in the past been hit by pandemic waves of the disease.2,327 laboratory-confirmed cases of shigella infection were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014 compared to 1,991 cases the previous year. At least 20 per cent of cases were related to travel.Confirmed cases in the UK have risen in recent years - according to Public Health England (PHE) this is most likely due to a rise in infections among gay and bisexual men. Clusters of cases have in the past also been reported in schools and day care centres - however, there is currently no warning of a general outbreak in the UK. More than one million people are estimated to die from shigella infections each year.Most cases clear up without issues but serious complications could include severe dehydration, seizures (particularly in children),  kidney failure and paralysis of the colon preventing bowel movement or passing gas which could cause the colon to rupture open if left untreated.Young children are the most likely to get shigellosis, but anyone can be infected. According to PHE, cases among adults in the UK (not just those returning from holiday) have risen in recent years and the majority of reported cases in the UK are now seen in people over the age of 16.People who go on holiday to developing countries could contract types of shigellosis that are not easily treated by antibiotics.There have also been outbreaks of shigella among gay and bisexual men who can transmit the bacteria during sex.There is still no vaccine to prevent shigella infection so practicing good hygiene is one of the main ways to help prevent the germ from spreading.According to Mayo Clinic in the US, hygiene measures you can take to prevent the bug from transferring to others include frequent and careful handwashing with soap, not preparing food for other people if you have diarrhoea, keeping children with diarrhoea home from school,  cleaning nappy changing areas after use and disposing of dirty nappies in covered, lined bins and not swallowing water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools. Severe or persistent cases of shigellosis are usually treated with antibiotics.You should pay a visit to your  GP if symptoms do not improve after a few days or are severe - for example if your or your child\u0027s diarrhea is bloody, if the diarrhoea is causing weight loss or dehydration or if it is accompanied by a fever higher than 38 C.

The funds have been added to £37,000 raised so far through a funding campaign on the website Crowdjustice.Postcard-sized original artwork after \u0026#34Sunflowers\u0026#34 being auctioned by the NG27Italian Renaissance specialist Richard Stemp, a spokesman for the group, told the Daily : “Between us we have more than 500 years of teaching experience at the National Gallery.“There are 27 of us, the least experienced of whom has worked at the gallery for 10 years and the longest  serving has been there for 45.“We have probably spent more time with these paintings than anybody in the world - even the curators who have other things to do.“Now we can’t use that experience to teach so we’re using it help the legal fund.”Members of the group protesting outside the National GalleryThe “NG27” allege that despite working regularly at the gallery for years, teaching school groups and lecturing on artworks, they were unfairly dismissed last October by the gallery which claimed it was simply ceasing a freelance arrangement.They say they were on the gallery’s payroll with tax deducted at source, wore staff passes, were required to attend team meetings and received formal workplace performance reviews but were dismissed in a meeting at which around a dozen staff jobs were offered to around 45 lecturers.Some of the 27 alleging unfair dismissal continue to work at the gallery on casual contracts.Mr Stemp said: “There would be weeks I worked seven days and other times less. But I relied on that work and they relied on me.”A spokeswoman for the National Gallery said it had received “a number of different claims from a number of freelance workers” and said the majority of claimants continued to work at the gallery.She said: “It is our understanding that the claims have arisen out of the Gallery\u0027s wish to change from offering ad hoc work to offering more secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits.“This change reflects the Gallery\u0027s strategy to develop our programmes to increasingly reach new audiences and make the most of digital technology to widen our engagement.”She said the group had been consulted over a three month period and had been offered jobs, adding: “The Gallery is not yet in receipt of the details of each complaint, but believes that we have acted both lawfully and fairly in changing our service provision to one of secure employment.”After Titian\u0026#39s \u0026#34Virgin and Child\u0026#34November’s tribunal has the potential to set precedent for workers’ right in the so-called “gig economy”.Last year Uber lost an appeal than its drivers should be treated as workers - rather than self-employed freelancers - and given rights including sick pay and paid leave, and this June a tribunal found drivers for delivery company Hermes were workers entitled to employment rights.But this is believed to be the first such case involving a public entity.

Luckily we were only staying for seven nights or I think I would have ended up in hospital in Egypt. When I got back my doctor diagnosed Salmonella.He added: It must have come from the hotel because we had an all-in package deal and the only food I\u0027d eaten was in the hotel.Mr Hawkins said the holiday cost around £2,500 and Thomas Cook agreed to pay him £2,000 compensation after negotiations.A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said Mr Hawkins had been compensated after returning home.

and as a result common grasses are able to out-compete rare high mountain species, which rely on low nutrient soils that other species can’t survive in.”Please review our commenting policyMourners line streets to say goodbye to John McCainComment: Victory for Brussels is inevitable.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/02/15/gettyimages-1025860422-0.jpg","title":"luciano silighini garagnani italian director weinstein is innocent tshirt venice film festival","story":"Created with Sketch.Conservative D-list Italian casting director turned filmmaker posed\u0026nbspfor tonnes of photosClick to followThe Independent CultureAn Italian director has worn a homemade t-shirt showing\u0026nbspits support for disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein at Venice Film Festival.Luciano Silighini Garagnani, a Conservative D-list Italian casting director turned filmmaker, proudly paraded a t-shirt which read\u0026nbsp“Weinstein is Innocent” with a photo of the mogul himself.Garagnani – who posed for tonnes for photos – also chose to wear trainers, jeans and a blazer while others wore black tie at\u0026nbspSaturday night\u0027s\u0026nbspred carpet\u0026nbspworld premiere of\u0026nbspSuspiria.\u0026nbspGaragnani is a known supporter of media tycoon and former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi.

During the meeting, Weinstein allegedly went out and reappeared naked and got into a jacuzzi where he masturbated in front of her and said he would make the script into a film if she stayed and watched.Liza Campbell, a British writer and artist, alleged that “Olympically ugly” Weinstein asked her to join him in the bath and began getting undressed at a hotel. In a piece for The Times, Campbell claimed she was forced to sprint to the door to escape.Writing in a blog post, Louise Godbold, a non-profit director in Los Angeles, said her encounter with Weinstein took the form of an “office tour that became an occasion to trap me in an empty meeting room. She said then Weinstein was “begging for a massage, his hands on my shoulders as I attempted to beat a retreat.”The\u0026nbspHollywood\u0026nbspmogul, who produced\u0026nbspShakespeare in Love,\u0026nbspPulp Fiction, and\u0026nbspGangs of New York, could serve life in prison if he is charged.\u0026nbspDakota Fanning, Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett, Alek Wek, Mia Goth and Chloe Grace Moretz attended the Venice\u0026nbspred carpet to celebrate the premiere of Luca Guadagnino\u0027s Suspiria.The t-shirt saga comes after Venice Film Festival was accused of failing to do enough to tackle the issue of gender disparity –\u0026nbspjust one film in this year\u0027s competition was directed by a woman.However the festival this week signed an agreement aimed at targeting gender equality.

But the challenge with the Chequers agreement is that it might tie our hands with those two other areas, domestic future policy and our future relationship with the rest of the rest of the world.Speaking last month, he added: \u0026ldquoNow what is good about the Chequers agreement is that at least we now know where the Government stands, even though it is not an ideal situation.\u0026ldquoBut, also in terms of those firms who deal into the single market.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has no skills or knowledge in animal husbandry.He added that his client and the pig were parva sprayed during the incident, so it was more a case of “peppered pig than Peppa Pig”.Police spoke to Murphy-Hankin around 10am after reports that he had been shouting abuse at passers-by.When they arrived police found Murphy-Hankin sitting in a doorway with a bottle of alcohol and the pig between his legs with no restraint.Andrew Nickerson, prosecuting, said while the defendant, who also had a dog with him, was being arrested the pig was “wandering around” on the road and had to be sedated.Mr Nickerson said the pig was checked over by a vet and found to be very young, possibly only a few days old.He said the vet found the pig had “quite acute” sunburn, was quite malnourished and for the first 24 hours needed to be fed milk every hour.He was also accused of a public order offence and having a dog dangerously out of control in a public place.But there were no welfare concerns for two dogs found with Mr Murphy-Hankin, the court heard."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004048946163.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"help to buy could be scrapped","story":"The programme gives cheap loans to first-time buyers hoping to get on the housing ladder and is supposed to ensure they’re not put off by the cost of a deposit.But stats have shown that much of the money available has gone to wealthy house-hunters - and critics claim the scheme has driven up already sky-high property prices.Now ministers are planning to replace it with a new system after the current arrangement expires in 2021, according to the Sunday .The Government may introduce a temporary extension to avoid massive disruption for developers, the paper said.But the new regime would put more emphasis on helping out the lower-paid, rather than giving handouts to the middle classes.Official figures released earlier this year showed that the average household benefiting from Help to Buy earns £55,000.And some of those using the scheme are drawing salaries of as much as £100,000, the Government admitted.Critics have accused Help to Buy of helping to push up house prices, because it boosts demand for housing without doing anything to increase supply.Matt Kilcoyne from the Adam Smith Institute think-tank told The Sun: Help to Buy has been no help to the vast majority.“Scrapping the scheme is a good step toward a housing market that works for everyone. The well-off shouldnt get a hand out from government that pushes up the price of houses in already expensive markets.”He called for ministers to take more radical steps to reduce the cost of housing - such as relaxing planning laws and even scrapping the Green Belt.But developers today warned the Government that scrapping Help to Buy could prove devastating for the construction sector and housing market generally.David OLeary of the Home Builders Federation told the Sunday : As well as supporting hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers on to the housing ladder, Help to Buy has driven unprecedented growth in housing supply since 2013. Builders continue to invest in new land and labour to build more.Without the scheme in some form, the Governments ambition to deliver 300,000 new homes per year will be even tougher to achieve.A Government spokesman said: The vast majority of those using our Help to Buy equity loan scheme are first-time buyers, as we help a new generation of people own a home of their own.More than half of households using it earn less than £50,000, so we are also helping those on lower and middle incomes get on the property ladder.Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey called for a change to the status quo, saying: As it stands, the scheme is poorly targeted and poor value for taxpayers money. Help to Buy should be overhauled and tightly targeted on first-time buyers with ordinary incomes, as Labour has long-argued."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000430551419.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inuries cyclist pothole flung into air","story":"Kevin Farrell needed surgery to repair his torn nose and lip and is now on a liquid diet after being flung through the air on the outskirts of York during a ride.The 53-year-old thinks the enormous pothole will kill the next person to fall foul of it.His front tyre exploded after going over the hole, and was unseated before his fellow four buddies ploughed into him.Dad-of-two Kevin, a self-employed electrical contractor from York, said: Weve seen potholes all summer long and we just dont see them getting repaired.Were all experienced, but if it was a child or someone less experienced, who knows what might have happened?The other four riders suffered injuries including a broken clavicle, cracked vertebrae and bleeding on the kidneys, as well as cuts and abrasions.Despite light being poor at the time of the smash, all the cyclists were using lights and wearing helmets, hi-vis gear and safety glasses.Kevin, who is hoping to seek legal action, said: There was a big lorry behind us, so it couldve been a lot worse.I think the helmet saved me and I think its time they were made compulsory.I just dont want somebody else to get hurt.

She’s now filed a human rights complaint.Speaking to the Osoyoos Times she said: “No male employee is required to wear an undershirt.

They’re not hanging down by my waist. If they were, whose problem is it but mine? These things happen and these things aren’t right.”Miss Schell said she confronted the golf club’s manager, Doug Robb, and he allegedly told her the dress code was for her protection.She claimed he told her: “I know what happens in golf clubs when alcohol is involved.”Employment lawyer David Brown said dress codes that apply different rules for different genders could be viewed as discriminatory under the British Columbia Human Rights Code.He said: It’s an interesting question as to whether or not an employer can dictate the underwear that women can wear, but they don’t say anything about the underwear that men can wear, and does that create an adverse impact on the individual?”Mr Robb declined to comment, saying employee matters were confidential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For Hoddesdon to have two fish and chip shops in the top 20 is brilliant.And it appears the two brothers are chips off the old block, as dad Sidney - now aged 81 - moved to England from Italy in 1957 and set up his first shop in East Finchley, North London, in 1963.And their brother Luigi runs Luigis Fish and Chips in Harlow, Essex, which was among the top 60 entrants in the UK-wide competition.The National Fish \u0026amp Chip Awards carefully assesses the chippies on a number of factors.These range from considering sustainable sourcing policies, menu development and innovation to staff training policies and marketing activities.Those in the top 20 will compete in two further rounds of judging to make it to the nation number ones chippy, as the shops undergo a further phase of mystery diner judging inspections to whittle down further to the top 10 shortlist.The finalists will be scaled down to ten contenders in September and the winner of the Fish and Chip Shop of the Year Award will be announced at The National Fish \u0026amp Chip Awards 31st anniversary ceremony in London on 24 January 2019."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-frank-field-brexit_4374372.jpg?20180728195154 ","title":"constituents divided over veteran mp frank field","story":"He described some local Labour members as \"often racist, ageist and sexist in nature\".On the high street in Birkenhead, they\u0027re all talking about it.\"I think he\u0027s made a mistake to resign the whip,\" says retired bricklayer Roger Lythe, 73.\"He\u0027s a good MP.

Research found 18% of owners who bought their pet over the internet after finding an advert online said their dog had been sick before its first birthday, with the illness continuing throughout its life or until its death. A further 13% said their puppy had fallen ill in the first 12 months but went on to recover. The Kennel Club survey comes after the Government announced plans last month to ban the sale of puppies and kittens by pet shops and other third-party dealers.  The pledge was a victory for the Mirror’s Lucy’s law campaign, named after a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel rescued from a Welsh puppy farm five years ago. The Kennel Club warned that puppies were being put at risk by a culture of “instant gratification”.  Its poll of 2,176 dog owners found one in three people do less than two hours’ research when buying a puppy, while 12% of people - equating to roughly a million dogs - pay for their puppy before they have even seen it.

In high school he’d been a hockey star and, when he left, he joined his family’s rubbish collection business. He had a bright future ahead of him. But before long, drug addictions had left Kyle, 29, in debt and he was increasingly distracted at work. His parents were upset they couldn’t get through to him, but they had no idea Kyle was working on an idea that would turn his life around. In May 2015, Kyle sent a text message to his girlfriend Jennifer Valiante saying he had come up with the ‘perfect plan’ that would ‘solve every single problem and give us a wealthy, amazing life.’ It got her interest. It seemed Kyle had found a way to get himself out of the rut he was in. Kyle’s parents, Jeffrey and Jeanette, owned J \u0026amp J Refuse, a rubbish collection business, in Easton, Connecticut. They’d given Kyle a job but knew he was a heroin addict. The couple were growing increasingly worried about their son.  They’d reached out to him about his drug use and offered to find him the help he desperately needed, but he’d refused. Jeffrey, usually a happy, positive man grew withdrawn. A friend later said that Jeffrey thought of nothing else but how they could help Kyle. A few years earlier, Jeffrey and Jeanette had helped their son buy a house, but he was falling behind with mortgage payments and bills. Finally, they decided it was time for some tough love. Jeffrey, 56, and Jeanette, 55, decided they were going to sell their company and stop financially supporting Kyle. Jeanette even told a friend they were ready to cut him out of their will, too. Somehow, Kyle found out. It motivated him to finally take control. It was then that he started to send his girlfriend text messages about his plan to fix everything and make them rich. He wrote about how he was going to ‘wipe out the virus and get money for life.’ On August 4, 2015, Jeanette and Jeffrey disappeared. Friends and family hoped they’d gone on an unannounced trip but their bank account was untouched and their pick-up truck was found abandoned in a car park. When questioned by police, Kyle claimed he and his mum had done a rubbish route together on the morning of August 4, and she’d been picked up by his dad afterwards.  It seemed like a plausible account and, at first, Kyle wasn’t a suspect. But he started to change his story, which aroused suspicion. Investigators looked into his phone records and discovered that Kyle’s mobile was in the same area as his parents’ phones on the day they vanished.  Two months later, their bodies were found in a wooded area close to a vacant house in nearby Weston. Workers had been clearing land and found their decomposed corpses in bags, buried under leaves. They’d been shot with a .40 calibre handgun. Police started to piece everything together – and Kyle was their prime suspect.  Murder supplies Investigators searched Kyle’s house. As well as drug paraphernalia, there was a blood stain that matched his dad’s DNA on a rug in the basement. There was also blood that matched his mum’s DNA in the boot of his truck. CCTV footage was found of Kyle and Jennifer at a local DIY store buying bleach, bin bags and drain unblocker – items police believe they used to try and cover-up the murders. They concluded that the ‘plan’ they’d been talking about for months was the murder of Jeanette and Jeffrey. They had been the ‘virus’ that Kyle talked about, and the way they were going to get wealthy was by inheriting their money before they could change their wills. Kyle and Jennifer, 31, were both arrested. Kyle was charged with murder and Jennifer was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and hindering prosecution. Investigators determined that Kyle had sat next to his mother in a garbage truck when she’d helped him out on his collection route. He’d pulled out a gun and shot her twice in the chest. His mobile phone records placed him at the scene. He then waited at home in the house his parents had bought him in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and a couple of hours later, he shot his father dead with the same gun.  Text messages Experts found text messages from Kyle to his dad on the day they were killed that suggested Jeffrey knew their lives were at risk, and he thought Kyle was going to set him up. ‘I’m not going home ‘till I know Mom is ok,’ Jeffrey wrote. ‘Did you hurt Mom?’ Kyle replied: ‘No absolutely not. Why would you think?’  ‘I go home and get framed for murder,’ Jeffrey replied. Kyle told him to stop being silly, and, although Jeffrey threatened to go to the police,  he must have gone to meet his son.  Kyle was held on a 2.5 million  bond and Jennifer’s was 2 million . At first, they both denied everything and pleaded not guilty. But the evidence was so convincing, they both changed their pleas. In April this year, the day before his trial was due to start, Kyle pleaded guilty to two counts of murder. He knew the damning text messages had sealed his fate and when prosecution indicated they would be used in the trial, he knew a jury would convict him.  When making his plea, the judge asked Kyle whether he agreed with the prosecutor’s version of how he killed his parents and he replied, ‘More or less’. At the sentencing, Kyle declined to make a statement publicly, saying he didn’t want to be a ‘show pony for the media.’ He was sentenced to serve 55 years for each of the murders and told they would run concurrently. He will not be eligible for early release. The judge called his actions ‘disgraceful and disgusting’. He pointed out that since 1986, there had only been 113 cases in the US of someone accused of killing their mother, adding that it was a ‘black-hearted crime’. ‘This idea of a killing by a child of his parents is exceedingly rare, it cuts against the fundamentals of our human condition, you don’t kill the people who gave life to you,’ he said. ‘One can only imagine the horror of Jeanette Navin when her son pulled a gun on her and shot her as she sat next to him.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"around 500 people fancy dress","story":"NewsAround 500 people in fancy dress left waiting awkwardly in street for hours after staff member oversleepsThe charity event was described as \"shambolic\" - as Sodexo, which manages out of hours activities at the site in Exeter, apologised for the situationShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAnita Merritt18:57, 2 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/hundreds-left-streets-fancy-dress-13182931,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAround 500 people in fancy dress were left standing outside a school for more than two hours this morning after a staff member overslept. One family dressed as The Incredibles, while other people had disguised themselves as Dalmatians for a charity mixed netball tournament.  The event, in aid of former Exeter Chiefs rugby player Ian Stewart who has terminal cancer, was due to start at 8.30am but the mishap meant he teams didn\u0027t get in until 10.45am, Devon Live reports.  Exeter players and many families were among those left twiddling their thumbs outside West Exe School in the city in scenes described as shambolic by local residents who faced disruption as a result of the crowd. A spokeswoman for Sodexo, which manages events at the premises out of school hours, said: “The person who was supposed to turn up and open the gates is a part-time adhoc Sodexo employee.  Unfortunately he did sleep in this morning and when were alerted we got an out of hours member of staff to open up the venue. “We would like to apologise for any inconvenience.” The event has gone ahead and is being held in aid of retired rugby player Ian Stewart and his family. Event organiser Anita Palmer, chairman of West Exe Netball Club, said: “I was here at 8.10am and the employee should have been here to unlock the gates at 7.30am but I was told he overslept. “I was told at 10am he was 10 minutes away but no one came until 10.45am and it wasn’t him. “It has meant about 500 people and their cars have been on Hatherleigh Road this morning. Half of the Exeter Chief players are here. “We have had people travel from as far away as Wales and London. It’s been chaos and understandably the local residents have not been happy. “The girls at the netball club have been wonderful putting the event together so quickly, and it was all booked and paid for so to have this happen is awful.” Among those who are taking part in today’s event is the Bassett family who are donning The Incredibles fancy dress costumes. They said: “It has been an absolute shambles. All these people have come together for the charity event and have just been stood here.” The event, involving 34 teams - including rugby and football players - was scheduled to run from 10.20am to 5pm, and the fancy dress theme is Disney as the Stewart family are self-confessed ‘Disney nuts’. It has been organised by West Exe Netball Club which Ian’s daughter attends.

It emerged today that the thief apparently managed to escape on August 7 with around \u0026pound300 worth of gear - in a store which has been known to stock expensive items by signature brands such as Gucci and Jimmy Choo.  Members of the royal family are understood to have donated unwanted items to the shop on Gloucester Road in the past - but there is no indication that anything they might have given in the past was taken.   According to The Sun , the thief apparently managed to gain access to the premises with little effort after picking up a set of keys left with the coffee shop opposite.  He is said to have claimed to them he was an Oxfam volunteer who had come to collect the keys.  He reportedly let himself into the shop on Gloucester Road an hour before it opened at 10am before loading the stolen goods onto a van parked outside. A source cited by The Sun said: “There is so much money round here that people would take in Gucci clothes. Royals like Princess Michael of Kent and the Duchess of Gloucester have even apparently donated items. “Everyone locally knows they leave the key nearby as they have so many volunteers in on different days “But this is a scandalous way for Oxfam to treat their security,” the source said.

Whether it be squishing grapes and trifle or simply being paid to have a pedicure Julie Preston AKA Mistress Dita is happy to help.  While she admits the weirdest thing she has ever done is feed a man from Grimsby dog muck she says she does turn her nose up at certain practices, Hull Live reports.  “I get asked to do plenty of stuff which I refuse to do,” Julie said. “But probably the weirdest thing I have actually carried out was feeding a man from Grimsby dog muck. I don’t even have a dog and had to collect it from a neighbour.”  “We get a lot of requests for people wanting to be babies,” she said. “I offer it on my premises but it is carried out by someone else and they act like a nanny. “It is often very powerful people like judges and CEOs who enjoy it and want a break from all that responsibility. They want to regress completely.” Julie is a big name on the one-time European city pf culture\u0027s sex scene and says feet have proved a fascination for many of her clients. “Foot fetish is massive,” she said. “I had no idea when I got into the industry how popular it was. “I have been doing this for ten years now and it is now a huge part of what we do and is one of the most popular services we offer. “People seem to enjoy kissing my feet bare foot or with stockings. Some like it sweaty and when I’m wearing gym socks. “Others like to watch as I squish grapes or trifle and it seems to turn them on.”  Foot fetish seems to be the domain of males, according to Julie. “Hardly any women seem to be into it, it is definitely the guys,” she said. “I go kickboxing and I get requests not to wash my feet afterwards. “Some just want to give you a foot massage or paint your toe nails.

Single mum-of-two Cleo Duckett, 46, said she discovered her bank account had just \u0026pound8 left in it on Friday night. Cleo, from Cefn Glas in Bridgend and on benefits as she suffers from polio and is on a wheelchair, said she has had to dig funds out of her son\u0027s savings pot in order to make until her next benefit payment on September 6. Fortnite is currently one of most popular video games among young people, garnering some 45 million players, according to Epic Games.  The programme contains in-game purchases where players can buy outfits, weapons and other items. Cleo, who receives around \u0026pound700 a month in benefits, said: I only found out about it all when I went to use the cash machine and there was only \u0026pound8 left in my account, she told Media Wales. Not long after that, Cleo received a text from the bank saying she was now in her overdraft. Cleo said: My son started crying and admitted everything that he had done. He had used my bank card behind my back, typed my details into his Xbox and bought lots of games on Fortnite.  He spent \u0026pound1,193.25, leaving me around \u0026pound245 into my overdraft. There was \u0026pound50 here and \u0026pound50 there \u0026pound60 here and \u0026pound66 there, and that\u0027s without the VAT. I think he must have been paying for different parts of the game. Cleo said she went to her bank in Cardiff on Saturday morning and was told by staff that it was her responsibility to cover the overdraft debt. The bank is refusing to help me because they said my boy is my responsibility and I am responsible for his actions, Cleo said. I\u0027m not a criminal. I haven\u0027t stolen the money or spent it on games for myself.

Now six months old and at home with his parents Katie Rhodes, 24, and Jay Taylor, 27, he is believed to be the smallest baby to survive in the UK.\u2028 Theo stopped growing in the womb and was so small doctors even offered Miss Rhodes a termination the day before he was born. \u2028 But the little fighter defied the odds to pull through despite weighing just 350g . \u2028 Theo was born early at 26 weeks and five days and Miss Rhodes, a support worker from Durham says he\u0027s a little fighter.  She added: Before he was born, it was really hard hearing all the time that he wasn\u0027t going to make it, and even when he was born that we might not get to take him home. \u2028 But we got through it by saying, \u0027no, he\u0027s made it this far, lets just support him\u0027. \u2028 We were so positive and kept saying that we would fight for him.\u2028 Mr Taylor added: I had never ever seen a baby that small - I didn\u0027t know babies could be that small. \u2028I kept saying to Katie that everything would be ok and he would be fine, but it wasn\u0027t until I saw him that I realised how serious things were. \u2028  I think that was the most scared I have ever been, but it was also a relief to see him.    Miss Rhodes\u0027 pregnancy was normal until the 19-week scan revealed Theo was smaller than expected. \u2028 Delivery driver Mr Taylor and Miss Rhodes discovered he\u0027d stopped growing and were told to expect the worse and prepare for a demise at almost every scan or meeting. \u2028 The mum-to-be was admitted to hospital with pre-eclampsia and three days later doctors performed an emergency c-section when tests showed Theo had fluid around his heart. \u2028 They were all really good and helpful and said they would do anything they could to help him, but right up until the day before he was born, we were offered an abortion, said Mr Taylor. \u2028 Doctors estimated he would be 450g - still below the 500g \u0027ideal\u0027 - but when he was born on March 15 at Newcastle\u0027s Royal Victoria Infirmary Theo was only 350g. \u2028 The couple only got to touch his hand for a few seconds before he was put on a breathing machine using the smallest possible tube. Doctors warned that he was so small he might not survive long enough to come home.\u2028  But his proud parents got to hold him properly after two weeks, and he was moved to a lower dependency ward when he was seven weeks old and 3lb.    Mr Taylor said: He was smaller than my hand and much smaller than they even thought he would be, but doctors said he didn\u0027t have any of the usual complications premature babies have. \u2028The doctor said he was about the weight of a can of Coke, but even when I picked up a can, it felt heavier than Theo. \u2028 On the day he was born one doctor said \u0027don\u0027t take for granted that you will be able to take him home\u0027. \u2028But he is proving everyone wrong. \u2028  The doctors that first looked after him came in over the weeks to see him and couldn\u0027t believe how well he was doing.   Theo, who was due on June 17, finally came home on July 7 weighing 7lb 4oz, after an operation to remove a hernia. \u2028He is still on nasal oxygen at home but is gradually being brought off it. Doctors don\u0027t think he\u0027ll suffer any problems in the future. Miss Rhodes added: It\u0027s much easier with him home now than in hospital. It feels like he has been with us for much longer than six months. It\u0027s weird to think that he was the smallest baby ever as he is so much bigger than he was and is doing so well now.

Beaches across the south-east of England were packed as temperatures soared to as high as 26C  in London and the south-east. And we can expect the good weather to continue in most parts of the country this week with September forecast to be largely warm and sunny. British bookmakers are even claiming September 2018 has the potential of being the hottest ever. Leading bookmaker Coral has cut the odds on this month ending as the hottest September on record in the UK into 6-4  after a warm start to the month. The firm is odds-on at 10-11 for 30C or higher to be recorded at any point in September.    Coral’s John Hill said: “It has been a warm start to the month which has prompted a flurry of bets on this September ending as the hottest on record in the UK. “The betting suggests temperatures will reach 30C or higher at some point in September therefore the barbecues shouldn’t be put away for the year just yet.” But the forecast for the week ahead sees the nation split from East to West with the western half of Britain and the south enjoying the better weather.    MET office weather forecaster Steven Keats said: “There is going to be an East/West split throughout the week with the East enjoying the warmer temperatures while the West experiences more chilly conditions. “Overall though it is going to be a pretty typical September week for most with sunny days and the odd rainstorm here and there. “It is going to be pretty good-going in the south and east with temperatures peaking at around 26C  at points but in the north and West and Scotland there will be a chance of rain with the top temperature there being around 17C .” Tomorrow, heavy showers over Wales and north-east England but these will fizzle out in the west through the day, but may persist for eastern England into the evening. Elsewhere, there will be sunny spells, and it will remain rather warm in the south-east with gentle to moderate winds. On Sunday, incredible pictures showed a rare tornado-like funnel of wind which was spotted in the UK. Autumn heatwaves are often referred to as Indian summers, but what does the term actually mean?  The Met Office Meteorological Glossary, first published in 1916, defines an Indian summer as a warm, calm spell of weather occurring in autumn, especially in October and November. The exact origins of the phrase are uncertain and several writers have speculated it may originally have referred to a spell of warm, hazy autumn conditions that allowed Native American Indians to continue hunting. Whatever the origin of the phrase, it was first used in the eastern United States.  The first recorded use of the phrase appears in a letter written by a Frenchman called John de Crevecoeur dated January 17 1778.  In his description of the Mohawk country he writes: Sometimes the rain is followed by an interval of calm and warm which is called the Indian summer. The term was first used in the UK in the early 19th century and went on to gain widespread usage.  But the concept of a warm autumn spell was not new to the UK. Previously, iations of Saint Martin\u0027s summer were widely used across Europe to describe warm weather surrounding St Martin\u0027s Day on November 11.  Amanda James, 45, spotted the unusual weather formation while her young son was playing in the garden and quickly grabbed her camera to capture a picture. She shared it online through UK Southwest Storm Chasers Ltd who revealed the clouds had been spotted in at ious sites around Cornwall, including this one in Truro. According to the Met Office funnel clouds - or \u0027tuba\u0027 - are extending, spinning fingers of cloud that reach towards the ground or surface of the sea but don\u0027t touch it. Amanda said she was watching it form for about 20 minutes.  She added: I was out in the garden with my son playing when I spotted it. I found the funnel cloud fascinating to watch and am keen on photography so loved taking the photos. It was quite amazing to watch. Funnel clouds are often associated with extreme weather conditions such as rain, hail, thunder and lightning. Upon reaching the ground, the cloud would become a tornado, which can produce very strong winds and potentially cause severe damage. A spokesman for the Met Office said: In the UK they often look like thin dangling bits of rope, hanging from the cloud above. But in hotspots such as tornado alley in the USA, funnel clouds can sometimes be thicker and much more intense.

Victim Kirsty Schofield, 38, had to flee to her neighbour\u0027s home wearing just a bed sheet to escape vicious Bobby Stewart, 29. He\u0027d become obsessed by the idea she was cheating on him when he launched the sustained attack in June. Just four days earlier he\u0027d been released from police custody where he\u0027d been on remand for a similar attack. The assault left the mum-of-one fearing for her life and led to her dialling 999 and making what a judge described as one of the most desperate phone calls he had ever heard.  Stewart had arrived at her home after a day of drinking and eventually lost control and attacked Miss Schofield as she cowered underneath the bathroom sink. After a 30-minute stand-off, during which she begged Stewart to call an ambulance, she escaped to the safety of her neighbours, wearing only bed sheets. Last month at Bolton Crown Court Stewart stuck two fingers up at her as he was sentenced via video link. Judge Timothy Clayson jailed Stewart for 15 months for actual bodily harm and nine months to run concurrently for breaching a suspended sentence order and also imposed a restraining order banning him from contacting Miss Schofield.  Miss Schofield, of Bolton, said: I honestly didn\u0027t think he was going to stop until he killed me. He looked evil and that\u0027s when I saw him for what he was. Before I could always forgive him, but not after that. She says she suffered months of emotional and physical abuse fat the hands of Stewart, which turned her into a nervous wreck and affected her work and isolated her from friends. Stewart would check her phone daily, force her to block friends and family and even called her at work if she didn\u0027t respond to his texts immediately. Miss Schofield said: “I actually met Bobby through his sister who I worked with last July and staggeringly she warned me off him. “I didn’t listen though as in my eyes he was wonderful, but it didn’t take long for the abuse to start and after two months he started getting violent. “It’s easy to say now that I’m at the other side I should have left him but I couldn\u0027t. I thought he was the love of my life and I wanted to be there for him and fix him.”  The violence continued and Stewart was arrested for assault by beating but Kirsty dropped the charges before the case went to trial. Desperate to believe he had changed, she took him back but Stewart attacked Kirsty the day he was released. Miss Schofield added: “I hoped jail would make him change his ways and when he called me saying he loved me and he was so sorry I believed every single word. I was brainwashed.  “So I naively dropped all charges but I was so so wrong, I should have left him to rot where he deserved to be. “He wanted payback for me getting him locked up and he was obsessed with the idea I’d cheated on him. Which I would never do. He was screaming at me that he knew I had and he wouldn\u0027t stop until I admitted it. “He dragged me around my own home and demanded I didn’t go to work the next day as he didn’t want me to leave his sight, he was so paranoid and controlling.” Describing the final attack she said: “He had been drinking and burst into the flat again. He was adamant I had been unfaithful and demanded to look through my phone. “Ridiculously, the last person who had called me was a taxi driver saying he was outside and he even rang the firm convinced I was having an affair with the taxi driver. “His eyes were wild and he just saw red so I ran to the bathroom wrapped in bedsheets and cowered under the sink where he hit and kicked me and stamped on my head. “I was sick and kept going in and out of consciousness and I begged him to call an ambulance but he just sat there and said I deserved it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman blamed doing poo driveway","story":"NewsWoman blamed for doing a poo on driveway of home after she appeared in disturbing CCTV footageHannah Lawton, 21, and Harris Stodell, 20, woke up to find a woman had defecated on the driveway of their student digs in CheltenhamShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKim Horton22:13, 2 SEP 2018NewsThe culprit caught on camera \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who defecated on the driveway of a student house was caught on camera moments beforehand.

Under new reforms approved in the western Mexican city of Guadalajara, police officers will still be able to report couple performing sexual acts, but only if a citizen raises a formal complaint.  Having sexual relations or committing acts of exhibitionism of a sexual nature in public places, vacant lots, inside vehicles or in private locations in public view” will only be considered an offence when flagged by a disgruntled citizen, the amendment to the Regulation of Police and Good Government states.   According to Mexican news site El Universal, the new measures approved in August are aimed at tackling police extortion in the city.  The reforms, presented by the Citizen Movement councilor, Guadalupe Morfin Otero, would allow for couples to “exchange their love” without fear of officers threatening them with jail if they don\u0027t give them some cash in return.  The act can cause annoyance, but if there is no complaint the police cannot act. He stressed, however, that if the act involves minors or is a violation, the police must certainly intervene because it is a crime.  The councillor went on: Displays of affection in the public highway are free and no police of Guadalajara will be able to bother you if there is no denunciation, he said, according to Publimetro.  It comes after a survey of students from both public and private universities found 90 percent of people had been confronted by police demanding they paid them or face being locked up in Mexico’s jails, known locally as “separados”.

display in Dundee.The books and sheet music were donated to the Wighton Centre at Central Library in 2013 after they were acquired at auction by the Friends of Wighton.Following a lengthy restoration process, which led to some books having to be conserved page by page, the volumes are now ready to be enjoyed by the public.A launch ceremony is being held at the Wighton Centre today at 11am, which will be attended by Sir Jimmy’s son Jimmy Jr and his wife Margaret.Jimmy Jr and his family also contributed additional material to the rare collection of classical Scottish scripts.Members of the Friends of Wighton’s instrumental classes will play a selection of tunes from the collection.Sheena Wellington, of the Friends of Wighton, said Sir Jimmy, pictured right, had been a discerning collector of books and manuscripts, some of which are hundreds of years old.Sheena – who like Sir Jimmy is an inductee of the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame – said: “We’re absolutely thrilled to have them on display and we have some real rarities.“There is a collection of 19th Century books bound into one volume that we believe could be a first edition.”Among some of the other treasures are an 18th Century collection of harpsichord songs and a book of ancient Orkney melodies from 1885.There is also is a volume of ballroom songs from 1870, of which no catalogue record exists in any library in the world – making it unique.Jimmy Jr said his dad – who died in 2000 at the age of 92 – would be “overwhelmed” to know his collection was being shared with the city.“I’m delighted about it all – my father would have been delighted too, that it is now something the public can enjoy,” he said.“We wish the Wighton Centre every success with the collection and hope a lot of folk come to see

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04106000/04106341.jpg","title":"Dont miss chance to nominate a hero","story":"TIME is running out to nominate someone you know to be one of this year\u0027s Highland Heroes.The awards, organised by SPP Media and now in their second year, celebrate people in the Highlands who make a real difference to our communities, healthcare, education, safety and wellbeing.Readers are being invited to nominate people in any of the 12 categories: primary pupil, secondary pupil, primary teacher, secondary teacher, carer, fundraiser, volunteer, community champion, brave child, health professional, emergency services or armed forces hero and public servant.The deadline for nominations is midnight tomorrow.SPP Media\u0027s editorial director David Bourn said: \"This is a last call for you to tell us about the real heroes who go above and beyond to make your community, workplace or school a special place.\"Highland Heroes wants to celebrate the contribution people in our area make to the lives of others by giving them the recognition they deserve.\"So if you know a Highland Hero, now is the time to share their story.\"To nominate somebody for the awards, visit www.surveymonkey/r/HighlandHeroes2018 or email heroes@spp-group with your name, address, email and phone number, along with the person you are nominating, up to 200 words to explain why, and their contact details.After the deadline closes, a judging panel will draw up a shortlist in each category before readers are given the opportunity to vote for their favourites in a special supplement we will publish in September.The winners of each category, along with an overall hero, will be announced at a ceremony at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness on Thursday, November 8.The awards are sponsored by Inverness Airport.* Click here to read more about Highland Heroes.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117280.jpg","title":"Exhibition plans revealed after dinosaur find","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt comes amid excitement at the recent discovery of dinosaur footprints near the city \u0026ndash the first time they have been discovered on the Scottish mainland.Inverness museum, which is bidding for \u0026pound15,500 from the Inverness Common Good Fund to stage the exhibition, says British Dinosaurs will have the \u0026ldquowow factor and believes it would benefit the city centre.In its application for funding, the museum stated: \u0026ldquoThere is huge public demand for a dinosaur exhibition but to date we have not been able to fulfil this demand because our venue is too small and the high costs involved are unaffordable.\u0026ldquoHowever, we have managed to source an exhibition which will be tailored for Inverness Museum and Art Gallery which will have the wow factor.The exhibition, set to take place between November and late January, will contain casts of dinosaur skeletons including a plesiosaur, the type suggested to be the Loch Ness Monster.Objects from Perth Museum and the Dinosaur Museum in Skye will also be on show plus interactive and holographic displays.Exhibitions officer Cathy Shankland said if it goes ahead, it would involve extending the usually reduced winter hours.\u0026ldquoEveryone loves dinosaurs, she said.\u0026ldquoThe fact there has been the discovery of footprints on the city\u0027 doorstep makes it even more exciting.Alison Parfitt, collections engagement curator, said High Life Highland services had run a summer activity programme with a dinosaur focus while a creative challenge, the Design-a-Saurus, is being developed with a strong science, technology, engineering and maths focus.Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, announced last week he had found dinosaur footprints, thought to be 170 million years old, at a coastal site near Inverness.- The latest applications to the Inverness Common Good Fund will be presented to the city committee on Thursday.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117291.jpg","title":"Inverness legends and history comes to life through new plaques and digital app","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe artwork on the plaques acts as a trigger for an app which uses augmented reality to bring a story to life using technology.The eighth and final plaque was installed on the Falcon Square statue.

“The additional areas gained in the farmhouse will be used to improve working conditions for the existing staff on the ground floor and create accommodation for visiting artists on the first

","title":"fifty of aberdeens most significant buildings celebrated in new book","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFifty of Aberdeen\u0026#8217s buildings have been selected for a book celebrating their historic and architectural significance.Author Jack Gillon’s book, Aberdeen In 50 Buildings, explores the history of the city through its “greatest architectural assets”.\u0026nbspThe book describes the city as “the place where commerce first took its rise in Scotland”.It reads: “The most remarkable thing about Aberdeen in the eye of the traveller, is the stone with which it is built.”Jack writes a brief history of how granite was exported annually to London to help pave its streets.This granite would go on to form part of some of the well-known buildings featured in the book, such as Marischal College, the Salvation Army Citadel at the Castlegate, Brig o’ Balgownie and the former Aberdeen General Post Office on Crown Street.It also features modern-day designs like Sir Duncan Rice Library, the Maggie’s Centre at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and Marine Operations Centre in Pocra Quay.Jack, who has lived in Edinburgh for the past 40 years, said: “I had an aunt and uncle in Aberdeen and was a regular visitor to the city with my family.\u0026#8220I have particular fond memories of visiting the city as a youngster and particularly playing on the giant draughts in Union Terrace Gardens with my dad – I even managed to include an illustration in the book of people playing draughts in the Gardens.“Emma Jane, my wife-to-be, was at college in Aberdeen and I would often visit the city.“In 1971, I worked for the summer as a street photographer for Sandy Nemeth who ran Photovision and was allocated a stand on Union Street.“Street photographers would stand around on the street, take a snap of you as you walked past, hand you a ticket with some reference numbers and an address where you could go along and have a look at the photo then decide if you wanted to buy a print.“In these days of digital cameras, selfies and camera phones it seems like a bit of an odd concept.“However, these were times when not everyone had a camera easily available in their pocket or handbag to capture fleeting moments.”Readers are guided through the city while learning more about the Aberdeen’s everyday buildings such as Aberdeen Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct.Opened on July 5 1892, the library, along with its neighbours His Majesty’s Theatre and St Mark’s Church, form a distinguished line of buildings known locally as Education, Salvation and Damnation.Statues have also made the list for their historical prominence such as the bronze Lord Byron in Aberdeen Grammar School’s grounds, the Wallace Statue across from HMT, the granite sculpture of the Duke of Gordon in Golden Square and the Mannie o’ the Well on The Green.The author recalls memories in Aberdeen and in some of its most known places such as the Bon Accord Baths.Jack added: “I had one of my first curries in the city at the Asia Kathon on Holburn Street, just around the corner from Union Street.“We had no bath or shower in the flat that I lived in on Erskine Street and a visit to the plunge baths at the Bon Accord Baths on Justice Mill Lane was a fairly regular necessary event – for a ’60s student.“I had made occasional visits to Aberdeen since these early days and it was a nostalgic pleasure to have the opportunity to explore the history and architecture of the city. There were parts of the city which were very familiar and others that had been significantly changed – mostly for the better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/hay1-135x180.jpg ","title":"hay blocks north east road after lorry sheds its load","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice helped clear hay from a road after lorry shed its load.The HGV was travelling along Rossie Island Road in Ferryden, Montrose, at around 11.30am today when a large quantity of hay fell off and spilled into the road.Police were called and officers spent 20 minutes clearing the hay from the road and directing traffic.The road became clear at around 12.15pm.Witness Angie Ogden said: \u0026#8220It happened near a roundabout near Bridge End garage.\u0026#8220It didn’t hold us up.

Council spent more than £1.3 million on repairing potholes and other defects last year – more than double the amount five years ago.The local authority spent £1,363,530 on repatching its roads in 2017-18.The figures, released under Freedom of Information  legislation, also reveals it fixed 20,404 problems that year.This compares to 2013-14 when it spent just £684,614 on resurfacing roads and in that year repaired 17,274 potholes.But Lib Dem group leader Ian Yuill said more needs to be done to tackle potholes.“If you ask anyone who drives or cycles on Aberdeen’s roads then they will tell you things are getting worse,” he said. “It’s welcome that the council is spending a little more in repairs but it’s still far from enough.“The council needs to invest year after year on bringing roads and pavements back up to a safe standard and keep it like that.“It’s failed to do that for the last five or six years and it’s just not good enough.”Councillor Jackie Dunbar, SNP operations spokeswoman, said: “This is hardly surprising given the condition of our roads as a result of years of neglect.“While the council committed to more spending, it did not support our proposals for additional resources this year and that was incredibly disappointing.”Since April, the council has spent £261,513 on patching its roads and has filled in 6,613 potholes in this time.The city council’s ruling administration committed an additional £10m over the next five years for roads and pavements when it set its budget and councillors agreed to add an extra £500,000 over the next year.That will be added to the £267,000 pothole-fighting fund which the local authority has already received from Cosla, the local government representative organisation.Council transport spokesman Ross Grant said: “In spite of remaining Scotland’s lowest funded council, increasing resources to better tackle roads maintenance has been one of our key priorities and we are delivering on that pledge to invest an additional £10m in our roads infrastructure over the coming years.“While there is more work to be done, as an administration we are dealing with more pothole repairs than in previous years and we are carrying out more extensive resurfacing than previously.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"talk on aftermath of ww1 at aberdeen museum","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA lunchtime talk looking into the aftermath of

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.

She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"cheese-sold-in-east-lothian-recalled-after-salmonella-found","story":"  L\u0026rsquoEARL Mounier of France is recalling some batches of its Cheese AOP Pelardon after finding traces of the bacteria in the product.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.

The event is being held ahead of the submission of a series of applications, enacting the existing planning permission for the mixed-use development.  The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.  The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.  Fraser Lynes, land and development director for Cruden Homes , said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have the opportunity to take forward the great work carried out by Socially Conscious Capital and Taylor Architecture.  \u0026ldquoOur involvement in this development confirms our commitment to the county and complements our other developments in North Berwick, Aberlady and Dirleton.  \u0026ldquoWe fully believe in the design principles which are embedded in the existing consent and look forward to delivering a truly bespoke product in one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos best locations.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.

This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The new local party leader thanked her colleague Mr Small for all his work over the last 18 months.  She said: \u0026ldquoHe has worked tirelessly to push forward the Scottish Conservative cause and I know that he will continue this work as the local representative for Haddington and Lammermuir.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom delighted that my colleagues have chosen me to take over the role of group leader, and I look forward to continuing our efforts in holding this minority Labour administration to account.We have a lot of hard work ahead of us but the Scottish Conservatives are up for the challenge and will never stop fighting for what\u0026rsquos best for our county."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-to-make-east-lothian-venues-give-two-weeks-notice-of-18th-and-21st-birthday-parties","story":"  The new policy would be introduced for licensed premises and be made a condition for any future applications.

But when she tipped the scales at 21st 5lb and a size 24 she decided she wasn\u0027t going to settle for a \u0027typical plus size A-line dress\u0027.  She then vowed to snuggle into her dream size 14 dress and immediately cut out fat from her diet, joined a Slimming World group and went swimming five times a week.  Rachel, of Blackburn, Lancs., said: \"I started swimming 50 to 70 lengths four or five times a week and my weight came down.  \u0026ldquoMy eating habits also changed and I swapped out bad foods for good foods.  \"I loved putting mayonnaise on everything so I cut that out and I\u0026rsquove stopped cooking a lot of things in oil.  \"I now remove as much fat as I can from foods and I now have fruit in my bag.

Speaking about her diet, she added: \u0026ldquoI never starved myself or went on a crazy diet, I just ate better. I don\u0026rsquot get the hypertension symptoms anymore, which is great.  \u0026ldquoBefore my weight loss, I was always tired, out of breath.  \"I had dreams of what I wanted to wear and with losing the weight I was able to fulfill it.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"30-powerful-photographs-by-sunday-herald-staff-photographers-sunday-2-september","story":"                        Sunday Herald world view:Photographer: Neil Bennett                        Sunday Herald world view:Photographer: Kirsty AndersonKabul, Afghanistan 5/06/04                        Sunday Herald world view:Photograpger: Stewart Attwood IDP CAMP NEAR THE FRONT LINE IN DASHT-I-QALA, AF\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtGHANISTAN.

The first edition of the Sunday Herald was published in February 1999 and captured a Scotland that is now unrecognisable.  Tony Blair, approaching his second anniversary as a Labour prime minister, had embarked on a radical agenda of social, economic and constitutional change. Devolution had been endorsed through a referendum and voters were three months away from voting in the first Holyrood election.  The first issue, assembled by visionary editor Andrew Jaspan and his team, carried a front-page interview with Blair by Kirsty Milne, who was the paper\u0026rsquos first political editor. The then prime minister told the fledgling paper that devolution was a \u0026ldquo21st-century symbol of a \u0026ldquomulti-layered democracy based on \u0026ldquopartnership in the UK and the European Union.  Fast-forward to today, which marks the last issue of the Sunday Herald, and few people could have predicted how the political landscape that had existed under Blair would change.  Back then, the SNP had around half a dozen parliamentarians. Now the party has more than 100 MSPs, MPs and MEPs. Labour dominated UK and Scottish politics in 1999 but has been out of power at Westminster and Holyrood for a generation. Debate still centres around the constitution, but on independence, not devolution. And Brexit looks set to extinguish our relationship with the EU.  The Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos political journey over that period reflects the switch made by large segments of Scottish voters: broadly sympathetic to Blair in the early years of his premiership, but turned off by the Iraq war. Tentatively pro-SNP in 2007 \u0026ndash more out of frustration with Labour than anything else \u0026ndash before becoming pro-independence.  However, regardless of constitutional politics, the paper\u0026rsquos political anchor never moved. Under all three editors \u0026ndash Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald was centre-left, socially liberal and pro-European. Appealing to younger readers was also a key part of its ethos.  My overriding memory of the Sunday Herald is not just of a paper that adopted a distinctive position on independence, but of a publication that broke big political stories and had far-reaching consequences. In circulation terms we were bantamweight, but in our coverage we fought at a higher level.  Milne, who passed away in 2013, was in the job for barely a few months before moving on and going on to become a renowned columnist. Its first Scottish political editor, Douglas Fraser, brought intellectual heft to the Sunday Herald and was in post for five years from 1999. While anti-devolution publications tried to undermine the Scottish Parliament, his coverage was marked by fairness and balance. He was an authoritative presence who was the right political editor for the time.  Fraser was in post during one of the most shameful episodes of recent Scottish history. In 2000, when Labour\u0026rsquos former minister Wendy Alexander announced plans to repeal anti-gay legislation which banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools, forces including SNP donor Brian Souter, the Catholic Church and the Daily Record mounted an ugly campaign of opposition.  Fraser and his colleagues, to their credit, extensively reported the distortions of the Keep the Clause campaign, while the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos stance urged the Labour-led Executive to hold firm. The paper\u0026rsquos uncompromising stance in defending a vulnerable minority group helped define its political outlook more than any other issue. Opposition to the Iraq War, meanwhile, bolstered its progressive credentials.  Fraser also covered the early traumas and controversies of devolution, such as the death of Donald Dewar and the resignation of his successor as First Minister, Henry McLeish, before moving to The Herald. We also benefited from first-class Westminster coverage from Iain Watson, James Cusick and Torcuil Crichton.  I became the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos Scottish political editor in 2004 after an approach by a senior figure on the paper. Although there had been a formal process, I got the impression the job was mine unless I cried or puked at the interview. I held my nerve and was hired by Jaspan.  Without making myself sound like a sociopath, I had a different temperament to Fraser and brought my own style. He was cerebral \u0026ndash I use that as praise \u0026ndash and interested in policy, whereas I was an angry 27-year-old who wasn\u0026rsquot quite sure what he was angry about. My title should have been \u0026ldquoanti-political editor. Months after I started, Jaspan moved to Australia and Richard Walker became editor. He wanted a more robust approach to politics, which I was comfortable with, and we worked together closely for 11 years until he left the paper in 2015.  I\u0026rsquom proud of our working relationship. An investigation into Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie\u0026rsquos expenses \u0026ndash yes, I think it was legitimate no, I don\u0026rsquot believe it was petty \u0026ndash led to him quitting and Holyrood publishing the entirety of the MSP allowances system online.  Stories on Labour chief Wendy Alexander\u0026rsquos dodgy donation to her leadership campaign triggered her resignation, while coverage of crooked MP Jim Devine\u0026rsquos expenses got him jail time. During the latter investigation, I was lucky not to die after getting knocked down by a random driver on the way to doing a television interview on the Devine story. I was later told a senior Holyrood figure had said he wished the accident had been \u0026ldquomore serious.  In 2012, by which time I was writing about politics as investigations editor, our stories on abuser Bill Walker, who was an SNP MSP at the time, led to him getting a custodial sentence. We also broke, and covered endlessly, the story on Labour shenanigans in Falkirk, which had major consequences outwith one town in central Scotland.  Reporters are only as good as their editors allow them to be. If your boss spikes your work, or puts it on page 38, the article has either zero or marginal impact. All these political stories were published during Walker\u0027s editorship. We had cross words once \u0026ndash it was my fault \u0026ndash and I can recall only one occasion in 11 years when I felt a good story had been canned. Any journalist would accept that sort of ratio.  Before this sounds like a self-regarding roll-call of glory, I should offer full disclosure by admitting to a mistake or two. In 2007, I reported that a mystery Labour MP \u0026ndash \u0026ldquohe or she \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquopoised to defect to the SNP. The story, much to my embarrassment, subsequently proved to be cobblers.  So appalled was I by the prospect of winning the Tartan Bollocks \u0026ndash given to the journalist who penned the most inaccurate story of the year \u0026ndash I fled to Paris for two nights and skipped the dunce ceremony. One colleague woundingly described my loser\u0026rsquos expedition as a trip to the \u0026ldquocity of self-love.  I also over-wrote a story about something vaguely controversial former first minister Jack McConnell had said about drugs when he was a student. My awful piece, which we splashed, had all the zest of a casserole that had been decomposing in a garden for six months. Walker\u0027s last-minute \u0026ldquotweaks did not help. In the end, it read like it had been written in Bulgarian and put through Google Translate.    Image: Bill Walker\u0027s violent past    Front pages: Wendy Alexander and Jim Devine    Splash: the Labour/Falkirk fiasco and free school milk  My successor, Tom Gordon, became Scottish political editor in 2008 and stayed in the job until 2016. To paraphrase author PG Wodehouse, it was never hard to tell the difference between Tom in a grumpy mood and a ray of sunshine. If there had been an Olympics for small talk, it is unlikely he would ever have made the podium. He was also the best reporter I worked with.  He and I \u0026ndash friends as well as colleagues \u0026ndash competed with rival papers, of course, but also with each other. We would have endless \u0026ldquodiscussions about joint bylines, whose beat a particular story fell on, and who had the best angle to justify top billing. It was my favourite time on the paper.  Gordon was the paper\u0026rsquos longest-serving Scottish political editor and had a terrific scoop count. He revealed how Alex Salmond had congratulated former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin on the botched ABN AMRO deal. He also reported how the Tory Government was planning to axe free school milk for under fives, a story that triggered a televised U-turn by the Government hours after its publication.  He also disclosed how Better Together secretly called their campaign Project Fear \u0026ndash a phrase that went viral \u0026ndash and exposed how the SNP had been auctioning Holyrood lunches at party fundraising events. One caveat: just as I cringe at my McConnell drugs \u0026ldquoscoop, I imagine Gordon does not dwell too long on his 2013 \u0026ldquoexclusive report about a predicted \u0026ldquooil boom in the North Sea. I did not seek a joint byline on that one.  Gordon\u0027s time in the job also coincided with the editor of the paper backing a Yes vote in the referendum. I offer no comment on this decision \u0026ndash it was above my pay grade \u0026ndash but some basic facts should be noted. Unlike other newspapers, whose big editorial decisions are influenced by proprietors living abroad, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos position was not taken by its owner but its editor. It was Walker\u0027s call and he made the decision. He explained it clearly and never shied away from defending what even opponents of independence would concede was a major moment in the campaign.  It has also been said Walker was motivated by commercial opportunism. Again, wrong. His decision stemmed from his personal belief in independence. He had been moving the paper in this direction for around three years and was convinced it was the right move for Scotland.  Walker left in 2015 and was replaced by Neil Mackay, who continued with the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos pro-independence stance and who was instinctively supportive of investigative journalism. Our last Scottish political editor was Andrew Whitaker, an impressive story-getter who was known for his persistence in pursuit of an exclusive. Whitaker\u0027s reporting led to the SNP Government announcing an inquiry into the miners\u0026rsquo strike and he revealed Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos plan for a reshuffle.  Having worked for 14 years on the Sunday Herald, it is natural I feel a huge sadness at the paper\u0026rsquos demise. However, a combination of branding difficulties and low circulation made the company\u0026rsquos decision to cease publication inevitable. The creation of two new Sunday newspapers is also a positive move for the media in Scotland.  The Sunday Herald no longer has a future, but this should not detract from the impactful political coverage that its editors and reporters produced in the years since its iconic first edition nearly two decades ago."},{"url":null,"title":"vicky-allan-waving-goodbye-on-a-feminist-wave","story":"  Here, then, are my last lines for a paper that\u0026rsquos taken up around a third of my life. I keep trying to think back to what things were like in 2003 when I arrived at what I thought was an utterly cool paper. Sixteen years is long enough not to quite remember how things were and how you thought the future world might turn out. But, among the many things I probably didn\u0026rsquot imagine is the past week of Scottish news, and that we would be watching one first minister  struggling to navigate what to do about the sexual misconduct allegations against the last first minister .  That, to me, says a great deal about where Scotland and the world have come to. It speaks of the journey that has been made in women\u0026rsquos rights, and what kind of behaviours we tolerate. Power structures seem, at times, like they\u0026rsquore on the verge of being overturned.  This world, where it\u0026rsquos conceivable that a political giant like Alex Salmond could fall over such allegations, true or not, is different to the one we were writing about in 2003. It\u0026rsquos also different from the one I reflected in 2015, when I casually described an interview meeting with Salmond in which he unexpectedly greeted me with a friendly kiss on the lips. The tone has changed \u0026ndash transformed by #MeToo.  But I\u0026rsquove seen, and covered, many other changes in that time. The revolution, for instance, in gender identity. It\u0026rsquos hard to believe that back in 2014, when I wrote a piece on non-binary people in the trans community, I had barely come across the term gender fluid. There has been a profound shift, too, in how open we are about mental health. I remember when I interviewed former MSP Rosie Kane about her depression back in 2004, it seemed like she was busting some intractable taboo.  The Sunday Herald reflected that changing world and debated it. It did more than that. It told the human stories behind it. It brought to its pages tales from the unheard or powerless, and it encouraged me, and other writers \u0026ndash Judith Duffy and Karin Goodwin \u0026ndash to look at the people who were struggling in 21st century society, as well as those who were shaping it. When, for instance, the Domestic Abuse  Bill was proposed, we carried harrowing stories from women who had experienced coercion and violence.  I\u0026rsquoll always think of the Sunday Herald as the place that nurtured my feminism and social awareness, as well as my journalism. Interviews with big names were part of that. But, above all, it was my meetings with everyday people who talked of their lives, dramas, challenges, and frustrations, that shaped my world view.  I mourn already the loss of the old Sunday Herald. I felt an immense pride at being part of the team here, of being read alongside such greats at Ian Bell, Iain Macwhirter, David Pratt, Joanna Blythman and Tom Shields. The editors I worked for were inspiring. But the world shifts. The industry moves.  What doesn\u0026rsquot change is the need for stories. Hence, I look forward to bringing them to the new hope, the Herald On Sunday.  Here\u0027s to all those good times  Did I forget to mention the fun? For, at least back in the early years, the Sunday Herald felt like it was a paper that was almost up for anything. Whatever madcap idea you had, there was a chance you could give it a go. Within my first couple of years I\u0026rsquod camped in the snow-blanketed woods with the Naked Rambler, been wolf-tracking in Poland, tried out as a commis chef at Andrew Fairlie\u0026rsquos. But others were pushing the envelope further. As Peter Ross, whose features writing lit up the paper for many years put it, in a tweet: \u0026ldquo The Sunday Herald was a blast at times. It felt like you could just do stuff.  In fact, no one really describes it \u0026ndash or, for that matter, anything \u0026ndash better than Ross. \u0026ldquoIn those days, he says, \u0026ldquoit was hardly a hard-bitten news room. It was more Girl On A Motorcycle than His Girl Friday: full of louche, bohemian types talking about fonts. I remember one colleague \u0026ndash I won\u0026rsquot name him, but it was Barry Didcock \u0026ndash turned up one day in sandals with his toenails painted blue. I remember we commissioned Edwin Morgan to review The Phantom Menace. Not sure what poor Eddie did to deserve that particular assignment. I think it was Pat Kane\u0026rsquos idea. Anything seemed possible, failure most of all. Every week there seemed to be another meeting at which graphs were wheeled out to suggest that we were probably doomed but might not be.  So here we are. Doom comes knocking for the Sunday Herald. But, as they say every death is a new beginning. Here\u0026rsquos hoping, whatever happens, it\u0026rsquos a blast."},{"url":null,"title":"businessman-who-ran-companies-while-being-a-disqualified-director-convicted-after-sunday-herald-investigation","story":"  Stephen Roberts, 50, was in effective control of two health and medical technology firms \u0026ndash one of which his law officer wife was a major shareholder in \u0026ndash while he was banned.  Roberts\u0026rsquo wife Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for homicide and major crime, is listed at Companies House as having had the largest holding of 8,997 shares in one of the firms, Log Six Systems , in 2013. Her husband owned 7,503, giving the couple a majority of the shares.  There is no absolutely suggestion Patrick knew about the management of the business at the time. The Crown Office is now investigating her husband\u0026rsquos financial affairs and have applied for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  Former bankrupt Roberts, of Troon, Ayrshire, was disqualified for four years in July 2010 after failing to ensure a previous firm, Innova Business Solutions, had paid tax. Innova owed \u0026pound292,882 when it was liquidated. An appeal judge described him as \u0026ldquoevasive\" and \u0026ldquodevious in cross-examination.  In 2013, a Sunday Herald investigation revealed Roberts was involved in a healthcare start-up, LSS, that won a \u0026pound50,000 prize at a Dragons\u0027 Den-style event funded by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government.  John Swinney, then finance secretary, presented the prize to Roberts and a former director but Scottish Enterprise later withheld some of the money. Despite Roberts\u0026rsquo directorship ban, which stopped him forming, promoting or managing a company, this newspaper uncovered footage of him saying on a crowdfunding site: \u0026ldquoWe kill superbugs, but we can do it 12 times faster and 100 times cheaper than existing disinfectant methods.  Log Six has the ability to save lives, time and money on a global scale with proven technology to a global problem. And with your help we can make it happen faster.  In another video, Roberts addressed an audience at Heriot-Watt University and said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a high-efficacy disinfectant chemical, which has been proven to kill every pathogen known to man.  The articles were followed by a police investigation and Roberts later denied two charges of being involved in the \u0026ldquoformation, promotion and management of LSS and another company, Nightingale Intensive Systems International, between September 2011 and July 2014.  After a lengthy trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Roberts was found guilty of both charges after Sheriff Iona McDonald ruled he had been a \u0026ldquodriving force of Nightingale and co-founder of LSS, where he referred to his \u0026ldquoinvestors.  McDonald told Roberts: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear you told almost everyone you were a disqualified director.  Gary Allan QC, defence counsel, told the court: \u0026ldquoThe whole sorry saga has been a social, family and financial catastrophe.  McDonald continued the case for 10 weeks for prosecutors to produce a statement of Roberts\u0026rsquo financial affairs for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-to-unveil-legislative-plans-to-msps-on-tuesday","story":"  Sturgeon, whose Government has been rocked by the sexual harassment allegations made against Alex Salmond, will attempt to get on the front foot by making announcements on the economy, mental health, and social security.

Ahead of the launch on Tuesday, the First Minister said:  \u0026ldquoOver the past year we have once again delivered significant improvements for the people of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoLast year\u0026rsquos Programme for Government contained radical and ambitious policies which have been widely praised both in Scotland and beyond our shores.

The first inklings of Project White took shape in February 1998 thanks to Gus Macdonald. Macdonald had risen from humble beginnings as an apprentice in the Govan shipyards to become one of the most significant figures in Scottish journalism. A glittering career saw him rise to director of programmes for STV by the mid-1980s and, after Tony Blair took power in 1997, he was made a life peer, taking his seat in the Lords as Baron Macdonald of Tradeston. He went on to become Minister of Transport and Cabinet Office Minister.  Macdonald, today in his mid-70s, was a powerful and influential man in the late 90s. At the end of 1997, he was appointed non-executive chairman of Scottish Media Group, then owners of both STV and The Herald. As a leftwing big beast in the media, Macdonald was a man uncomfortable with the state of the Scottish press \u0026ndash for both political and business reasons. He felt the right-wing tilt of the Scotsman skewed the national debate, and also worried that The Scotsman \u0026ndash combined with its sister paper Scotland on Sunday \u0026ndash was a threat to both The Herald\u0026rsquos circulation and advertising revenues. So he hit on an idea \u0026ndash what if The Herald had a Sunday title as well \u0026hellip  One of the other big beasts of British and Scottish journalism in the 90s was Andrew Jaspan \u0026ndash a gifted maverick and an inspirational leader who had edited The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday. In early February 1998, Jaspan received a phone call from Macdonald out of the blue. Macdonald asked if they could meet in the House of Lords.  \u0026ldquoBack in the 1970s, Jaspan says, \u0026ldquoGus would have wanted a blether over a pint of beer, in the 1980s it might have been a glass of wine, now he tempted me with \u0026lsquotea served in the finest House of Lords\u0026rsquo bone china\u0026rsquo.  Macdonald had a simple proposition: would Jaspan be interested in setting up a new Sunday paper? Jaspan quickly agreed and soon he and the CEO of Scottish Media Group, a reserved but affable and media-savvy former accountant called Andrew Flanagan, met in London. Flanagan asked Jaspan to come up with a feasibility study \u0026ndash how much would this paper cost, how many staff would he need, how much money could it pull in, and most importantly: what would the paper stand for. Jaspan was told to keep the entire scheme utterly under wraps. Not a word was to be breathed to anyone.  Gary Hughes, Flanagan\u0026rsquos deputy, told Jaspan it was to be called \"Project White\". Jaspan asked why \u0026ndash Hughes replied \"because we have given you a blank sheet of paper\".  What followed next was a five-month period of intense and secretive work by Jaspan in order to get the figures right, mould the editorial philosophy, and come up with the branding and marketing for a new paper for Scotland \u0026ndash one of the most crowded newspaper markets in the world. By the end of August, Jaspan delivered Flanagan his masterplan.  He wanted to create a paper that felt young and aspirational.  The world had changed drastically by the time 1998 came to a close \u0026ndash the age of deference was dead, the Cold War was over, the Good Friday Agreement had been signed bringing peace to Northern Ireland, and Scotland was soon to get her own parliament again. Facile as it may sound today, back then \"Cool Britannia\" \u0026ndash a cocktail of Britpop, the craze for young British artists like Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, fashion designers like Alexander McQueen, a new youthful Labour government, and a growing economy \u0026ndash seemed to sum up a country brimming with hope and change.  \u0026ldquoHistory was in the making and I wanted a paper that would embrace this change, Jaspan says. When it came to the new era of devolution, he wanted the paper to \u0026ldquowelcome the opening of a new chapter for Scotland. That\u0026rsquos not to say the paper would be a cheerleader, but we would give the new constitutional arrangements a chance to succeed, and pounce on any ill-thought out policy or actions. It was, then, to be a paper both positive about Scotland \u0026ndash there would be no \"Scottish cringe\" \u0026ndash and a watchdog over those in power. But what would it be called? From the get-go, the title that became the frontrunner was the \"Sunday Herald\".  \u0026ldquoThis instantly told readers that the paper was part of The Herald family, but of course a new Sunday paper, Jaspan says. \u0026ldquoWe had messed around with other neutral names, but no others were seriously considered. The upside was that this would be an easier sell to Herald readers \u0026ndash that is, to ask them to drop Scotland on Sunday and chose a west coast Sunday, the downside was that Edinburgh readers might still shy away from a Glasgow paper.  But the Sunday Herald was never intended to be just a Glasgow paper. Capturing sales and ad revenue on the west coast of Scotland was merely the first step to securing the financial future of a new national title, a newspaper which saw itself on the world stage, not on simply the British or Scottish stage.  With the title and vision in place, Jaspan needed to give the paper \"a look\". How to design a paper that wanted to be different to every other paper on the news stands? This was a paper that wasn\u0026rsquot going to talk down to readers, or tell them how to think \u0026ndash it would take for granted that readers were intelligent and well-read, that they wanted information and entertainment, not dull instruction from above. The look of the paper had to reflect that very modern approach to news.  So, one of the most talented designers in European newspapers made a trek north to Glasgow. Simon Esterson had won plaudits internationally for his work on the redesign of \u0026rsquos G2 section. To Jaspan, when it came to designing the new paper, Esterson was the only person for the job. Perhaps the best way to explain how radical Esterson\u0026rsquos design was is to ask you to turn to the front cover of this paper and look at the masthead \u0026ndash the title is all in lower case, the colours vivid primary blue and red. It 1998, this was a radical approach to newspaper design, and a dramatic way to signal a break with the papers of old. The Sunday Herald was to be simple, elegant \u0026ndash a canvas for what would go on to be award-winning photography and journalism. As the first new paper of the 21st century, Jaspan wanted to \u0026ldquoproduce journalism to read, not flick through.  The paper was to have six elements: five printed sections \u0026ndash News, Seven Days , Sport, Business, Jobs and a magazine \u0026ndash and, crucially, one digital section, a website, marking the Sunday Herald as the only paper to embrace online at this stage. Back then, The Herald and The Scotsman still had no web presence. After the Sunday Herald launched \u0026ndash using its website as an integrated part of the paper \u0026ndash , now one of the world\u0026rsquos most popular news sites, soon followed suit.  By now, everything was in place \u0026ndash apart from people: the staff who would make this still imaginary venture take life. And it was the people that made the Sunday Herald. Anyone \u0026ndash and I mean literally anyone, apart from a few sad souls who just didn\u0026rsquot get the spirit of the paper \u0026ndash anyone who has worked on the title will say without hesitation that not only did it give them the best years of their careers, but it often made their careers, and it made them friends \u0026ndash and sometimes lovers \u0026ndash who last with them until this day.  The first two people to be brought onboard were Charles Magee \u0026ndash a consummate journalist who has mastered every art in the industry \u0026ndash and Richard Walker, one of the most talented, hardworking journalists in the UK. Both had worked with Jaspan at Scotland on Sunday. Magee was to work on a publishing system \u0026ndash a bit like building a bespoke desktop printing press from scratch \u0026ndash and Walker tirelessly fine-tuned design. The three-man team holed up in a backroom in STV that stored the props for the crime show Taggart, working in secret to keep opposition newspapers in the dark.  With the foundations now in place, Jaspan went to the board of directors of SMG in September 1998 and got final approval to launch the paper \u0026ndash the only member of the board who seemed less than enthused was David Montgomery, the notoriously dour Ulsterman who had set up the now defunct Today newspaper, and was then running Mirror Group, which had a stake in SMG. Despite the board\u0026rsquos support, there was a sting in the tale for Jaspan: the board wanted the paper launched by the end of January 1999. He had three months to get one of the most ambitious media projects of the last half-century off the ground, and an entire team \u0026ndash more than 50 staff \u0026ndash to hire.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to recruit a cadre of journalists,Jaspan says, \u0026ldquowho would relish the challenge of working on a new paper, which would be a beacon of editorial excellence in everything it did. I wanted to hire journalists who had fire in their bellies \u0026ndash those who wanted to prove themselves rather than those hacks who just wanted to play the safe game and sleep-walk to their pension. I wanted free thinkers who would give the paper a feel of being new and different, so that we would not just be another ordinary Sunday newspaper.  In the end, that thought \u0026ndash \"No Ordinary Sunday\" \u0026ndash would become the tag line for all Sunday Herald marketing and branding. But it also helped Jaspan focus his mind on the kind of people he wanted working for the new Sunday Herald.  He quickly assembled a team, pillaging the best talent from opposition titles in Scotland and London \u0026ndash what better way to get the jump on Scotland on Sunday than taking its gunslingers and have them turn their firepower on their old employer. When staff were hired they were a little taken aback to find themselves each given a beanie hat \u0026hellip emblazoned with the logo \"No Ordinary Headline\"."},{"url":null,"title":"maverick-genius-some-just-plain-mad-people-behind-the-sunday-herald","story":"  There are too many names to list here but among those that stand out from the early days were Pennie Taylor, who joined as health editor from the BBC and remains to this day one of the go-to experts on the NHS Connie Henderson, an unflappable news editor also brought in from the BBC Torcuil Crichton, now the Westminster editor of the Daily Record and undoubtedly the most charming Gael to ever have left the western isles Susan Flockhart, the former editor of the Big Issue in Scotland and an old-fashioned intellectual who brought real gravitas and intelligence to the newsroom David Milne, a bright whip-smart young executive also from the Big Issue in Scotland who now looks after STV\u0026rsquos digital side Lesley Riddoch, the voice of Scottish feminism and a big brain and big player in the nation\u0026rsquos media Ron McKay, a hack\u0026rsquos hack, game for anything, and one of the best reporters to ever come out of Scotland David Pratt, perhaps the most seasoned war reporter this country has ever produced and a man who has risked his life countless times to bring back to Scotland the truth about what is happening overseas David Dick, known to the crew as Dave Vegas  and another big talent who is now the editor of the Daily Record Roxanne Sorooshian, one of the best production journalists in the game Jane Wright, a brilliant magazine executive and a woman born to throw a good party Alan Taylor, a literary flaneur and Scotland\u0026rsquos answer to Tom Wolfe Ian Bell, perhaps the greatest Scottish columnist ever, now sadly dead at too young an age and a loss to us all Donald Cowie, an unassuming and charming sports editor Trevor Royle, a quintessential gentleman and military historian who became the paper\u0026rsquos diplomatic editor Chris Furlong, a former soldier turned photographer with the eye of an artist and a big, kind, happy heart former BBC anchor Iain Macwhirter, a man who knows more about Scottish politics than just about anyone alive Pat Kane, pop star turned public intellectual and Simon Stuart, a chief sub-editor who subjected copy to linguistic forensics and had a gift for hollering the most inventive expletives should a split infinitive or unnecessary pluperfect tense ever cross his desk \u0026ndash the man was a veritable Profanisaurus he\u0026rsquos now an acclaimed psychologist after leaving journalism.  There were so many people, and so much talent over the years, that it is impossible to include everyone \u0026ndash but the early team was very special almost like a little family. The team bonded quickly and supported each other like siblings, remaining friends to this day. It was a cast of characters that could have stepped off the pages of Evelyn Waugh\u0026rsquos Scoop.  Once recruited, the team gathered together before Christmas 1998 in the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash the old Herald building on Albion Street. As its nickname suggests, this towering strange, black tile and glass, art deco-meets-brutalist monster was as charming as its namesake KGB prison in Moscow. The team holed up on the top floor \u0026ndash in a building that smelled of bad canteen food and cigarettes. Cigarettes played a major part in the early days with most staff taking it in turns to hang out of the toilet window for a lightning quick drag on a fag before racing back to their desks to finish a 12-hour day.  If the bricks and mortar were less than salubrious \u0026ndash the new Sunday Herald office was something different, something very modern: it was the first newsroom kitted out in day-glow iMacs, each desk dotted with a neon green, blue or red computer. Staff soon learned that each byline would be printed in the paper with an email address beneath. It may seem quaint now \u0026ndash but this was cutting edge, and it represented something very democratic, a way for readers to directly communicate with the writers in their paper of choice.  Staff at The Herald and the Evening Times \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos other sister paper \u0026ndash kept their distance, suspicious  both of what changes the new paper might usher in for them, and of the loosening of corsets on the top floor. Not all Sunday Herald staff came to work in a shirt and tie, or a nice two-piece ladies\u0026rsquo business suit. There were strange rumours that some staff at the Sunday Herald were seen wearing jeans and even \u0026hellip trainers. This was Generation X taking over the newsroom, and not everyone was chuffed about it.  The Sunday Herald even had its own dedicated entrance at the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash the separation was intentional, in order to preserve the distinct identity of the paper, but also so such sights as staff coming to work listening to headphones would not cause mass disgust on the other floors.  Before the first edition rolled off the presses in early 1999, all staff got together for a mass briefing from editor Andrew Jaspan. \u0026ldquoI wanted to make sure everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet, he says. The vision which Jaspan laid out to staff was this: the paper is being born at the fag end of the 20th century, so look forward, not back \u0026ndash embrace change and challenge yourself and despite the changing and increasingly hectic and atomised way we live our lives in modern Scotland, Sunday remains a day distinct from the rest of the week, it is a day of relaxation, play, family and food \u0026ndash so amuse readers, give them some laughs along with the heavy news. Sunday newspaper readers are also notoriously promiscuous \u0026ndash hopping into bed with one paper one week because a free CD is being given away, but picking up a different paper the following week because of an investigation or big celebrity interview \u0026ndash so we had to give them a reason to fall in love and stay with us.  Jaspan had a few nice little metaphors to throw in as well. A Sunday newspaper is different, staff recall him saying, because the reader isn\u0026rsquot reading their paper on the train or over a hurried breakfast, they are reading the paper over a leisurely lunch, or at home on the couch, or even naked, in bed. \u0026ldquoArouse them! Jaspan hollered. Sunday papers, Jaspan knew, relied on an element of \"theatre\" \u0026ndash journalism is the lowest rung of show business after all \u0026ndash so the Sunday Herald needed to stand out, be different and make readers stop and think.  Finally, Jaspan, told his team, everything could be boiled down to the four \"I\u0026rsquos\" \u0026ndash the paper must be independent of thought, intelligent, international in outlook and, when needed, irreverent to authority.  That was it \u0026ndash the staff had a few weeks to go before the revised launch date, February 7 1999, so they better go off and start finding stories and thinking up some good ideas. The next two Sundays saw the team work on two dummy editions of the paper, making sure the production system was right, that stories were being filed on time, and that the whole thing knitted together in one seamless chain from newsroom to corner shop. There was one casualty in those few weeks before the paper went live \u0026ndash a section head who was just a little bit out of their depth, and left before the heat in the kitchen got too hot for them. My one abiding memory of this time is of being cheated out of a cracking story I\u0026rsquod written making it onto the news stands. Our final dummy paper was to have a print run of less than 100 so staff \u0026ndash and only staff \u0026ndash could see what an actual physical edition of the Sunday Herald would look like. We spent Saturday as a live news day \u0026ndash each of us doing our jobs as if the paper would be in the shops the next morning. My beat was crime and terrorism. Around noon, I got a call that a big paramilitary player in Northern Ireland had been killed. I hit the phones and got details on the murder, the killers, the motive, pictures \u0026ndash the lot. The execs decided the story was the splash \u0026ndash but it was a splash that would never see the light of day."},{"url":null,"title":"the-camaraderie-nothing-but-a-bunch-of-absinthe-sipping-dilettantes-less-of-the-sipping-please","story":"  \u0026ldquoThat was my final hoorah at the Sunday Herald, says Jaspan. \u0026ldquoWhen I addressed the staff to say I had resigned, I felt terrible. I had hand-picked this team and they had been truly brilliant. They had given their all to make this paper special. I thanked them all from the bottom of my heart.  The Sunday Herald had also by now developed a reputation not just as a hard-working paper, but a hard-partying paper. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how everyone did it, Richard Walker recalled. \u0026ldquoPeople seemed to work to three in the morning, go out clubbing and then come in the next day and do it all over again.  It probably didn\u0026rsquot help that the original office on Albion Street \u0026ndash the Black Lubyanka \u0026ndash was directly above our printing presses and the Press Bar, so no matter what time you finished work you could pick up a paper and pop into the pub, where many a night began often with Simon Cunningham, a lead on the design team, telling a story so outrageously filthy it made the whites of your eyes blush.  There were plenty of love affairs, more than a few heartbreaks, at least one baby born thanks to their mum and dad meeting in the newsroom, a lot of dancing and clubbing, and way, way, way too much alcohol and partying.  But it was all very innocent as well. It wasn\u0026rsquot mean or debauched or sleazy \u0026ndash it was celebratory and, at worst, silly. Ironically, one senior executive, with a glutton\u0026rsquos taste for cocaine and a phoney po-faced line in moral rectitude, who was at a rival paper \u0026ndash I won\u0026rsquot say whether it was Scottish or London-based in order to keep speculation as wide as possible \u0026ndash once described the Sunday Herald staff as a \u0026ldquobunch of absinthe-sipping dilettantes.  Absinthe, yes. Dilettantes, yes. Sippers? Never. We glugged \u0026hellip but then we were all much younger back then. Fun was part of the secret recipe of the Sunday Herald \u0026ndash not just providing fun for the reader, but having fun ourselves, from the editor down to the copy boy or copy girl. It was a paper which celebrated and revelled in individuality, mischief and just having a laugh.  There are too many bizarre and silly stories to tell \u0026ndash trying to buy the island of Gigha, putting on a band made up of Sunday Herald staff at T in the Park just for the hell of it \u0026ndash but perhaps the best one involves Prince Philip, Special Branch and Billy the Singing Sea Bass.  Around 2001, the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to open SMG\u0026rsquos new building at the top of Renfield Street, where the papers had moved after abandoning the Black Lubyanka. Sniffer dogs were sent through the building before Philip was, bizarrely, to attend morning conference \u0026ndash much to the barely concealed displeasure of a predominantly anti-monarchist staff. The Queen was wandering about in The Herald office, if memory serves.  In the conference room, there was a wall of honour, with many of the best awards staff had won over the years, and in the middle of the wall was Billy Bass \u0026ndash in case you\u0026rsquove forgotten this cultural blip of the new millennium, a Billy Bass was a replica plastic sea bass mounted like a fishing trophy.  Significantly, Billy Bass also sang. He had some sort of trigger mechanism and if it was activated he would sing, in a kind of Barry White baritone, \"Take me to the river\". Philip sat in front of Billy. We sat around Philip.  Photographers were filming Philip at conference, and as best as anyone can recollect, a flash from a camera activated Billy and he began his mournful, piscine chant. Two armed special branch officers rushed into the room, ripped Billy off the wall like a terrorist and raced with him outside. They believed he was some sort of bomb, albeit a singing one. Philip shouted: \u0026ldquoJust bloody shoot it!. After that Philip got pretty bored and left, presumably to catch up with the Queen and tell her that he\u0026rsquod had a plastic fish executed by Special Branch in the piazza in front of Herald Towers."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-heralds-triumph-over-ryan-giggs-super-injunction","story":"  JOKES and silliness aside, there was not one member of staff unaffected by Jaspan leaving for the other side of the world \u0026ndash to many he\u0026rsquod been a mentor. I especially admired him for giving me my head as an investigative journalist and allowing me the time and resources to do the sort of reporting that is all but impossible today in new super-slimmed down newsrooms. Before he left though, Jaspan made sure the best candidate took over his editorship: Richard Walker, who was by then deputy editor of the paper. \u0026ldquoI felt that Richard uniquely understood the ethos of the paper \u0026ndash he was best placed to look after it and cherish it, Jaspan says.  Walker is one of the most decent and honest people you can meet, so it\u0026rsquos no surprise to hear how candid and even humble he was about assuming the role. \u0026ldquoIt was intimidating, he said, \u0026ldquoAndrew\u0026rsquos were a very big pair of shoes to fill.  Walker was given a \u0026ldquosort of life coach by the new owners of the Sunday Herald, Newsquest, to help him transition into the role of editor \u0026ndash a big, difficult job. The life coach advice was simple \u0026ndash do something to stamp your own mark on the paper, to make it your own.  So, heeding those words, Walker took the most modern of papers and added a little extra top spin of modernity \u0026ndash dropping the old broadsheet format and making the paper a compact. Tabloid in shape, broadsheet in style, delivery, tone and content.  Seasoned journalists from other titles had joined the Sunday Herald and were leaving their indelible mark on the paper. Kevin McKenna, one of the smoothest operators in Scottish journalism and a man with a contacts book most hacks would die for, arrived before Jaspan\u0026rsquos departure, bringing with him years of experience and deal-making, adding to the gravitas of the paper. In 2006, dogged political editor Paul Hutcheon won highly-deserved plaudits for investigations revealing that David McLetchie, then leader of the Scottish Tories, had abused taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to pay for taxi fares for legal and party work. McLetchie later resigned.  We were also now easily attracting star names to the paper. To me one of our all-time great reads was a piece commissioned by David Dick, then sports editor, from Budd Schulberg, the man who wrote the movie On the Waterfront, on Muhammad Ali at 60. A piece worthy of gracing the pages of the best papers in history.  Now well and truly a mature newspaper, with its roots laid down and its infancy long behind it, the years ticked by as they do for all papers \u0026ndash but unlike every other paper, the Sunday Herald has mischief in its DNA and was always looking to take on authority. Let\u0026rsquos fast-forward to May 2011. It was the era of the super-injunction, with the rich and famous able to stop any unsavoury story about them being published.  Years before, the Sunday Herald had flouted a super-injunction over a story relating to a member of the royal family. We\u0026rsquod realised that the injunction did not run in Scotland as it had been granted in an English court, and I wrote a piece which went on the front page detailing the allegations, much to the delight of Scottish readers and the chagrin of those south of the Border where we did not publish.  In order to not flout English law we did not run the story online. Given that this story which you are reading is going to run online, I can\u0026rsquot go into details of the royal piece \u0026ndash but I am sure you can find it if you go to a good Scottish library.  In 2011, however, thanks to Twitter and Facebook, most people knew the names of the rich and famous who\u0026rsquod taken out super-injunctions as well as the reasons for taking them out. I was head of news back then and mid-way through a long Saturday afternoon, Richard Walker and I started reminiscing about the royal story and the fact that the Sunday Herald had been able to ignore a super-injunction in the past because of the gap between English and Scottish law.  I think the look of gleeful recognition crossed his face before mine, but within minutes Walker was on the phone to lawyer \u0026ndash Paul McBride, a man who wore his swagger like a suit, but was loved by pretty much everyone who knew him. Sadly, he died too young, still in his mid-40s while on a trip to Pakistan some years back. Yes, the story was entirely doable, said McBride. Within the hour, there was a front page \u0026ndash iconic now you look back on it \u0026ndash of Ryan Giggs with a thin black strip across his eyes and one word \u0026ldquoCensored.  Under any other series of events, this was not a story which the Sunday Herald would have cared much about \u0026ndash the love life of a footballer not being something that we would see as a fit with our readership, or have any public interest issues surrounding it. But this story was in the public interest and it was not about someone\u0026rsquos private life \u0026ndash this was about power and money and fame having undue influence when it comes to the law, and the utter ludicrousness of everyone in the UK who was online knowing the nature of the story and talking about it in pubs and offices and their own homes, while press and broadcasters could not report a single word. The next day Giggs was named in parliament, and the then PM David Cameron said the law needed to catch up with how people consume news in the 21st century.  Walker says he woke up on the Sunday we published the story and thought \u0026ldquowhat the hell have I done, but it was to go on to be one of the crowning achievements of his editorship, putting the Sunday Herald at the centre of a national debate about wealth, privacy and privilege.  By now, the Sunday Herald was following a political trajectory similar to many of our readers. Like many of our readers, we were liberal, progressive and we had fallen out of love with the Labour Party. The SNP \u0026ndash buoyed in many eyes by its valiant opposition to the Iraq War \u0026ndash seemed to offer an alternative home to those of a progressive persuasion. As a paper which had championed devolution, it was \u0026ndash as it was for many of our readers \u0026ndash only an intellectual hop, skip and a jump to supporting independence.  \u0026ldquoIt was a natural progression,\" says Walker, who was editor when the Sunday Herald became the only paper to back Yes in 2014. Not all members of staff supported independence and some were undecided \u0026ndash but as Walker says: \u0026ldquoA member of staff\u0026rsquos politics are up to them. We weren\u0026rsquot inspecting political identity cards, that\u0026rsquos for sure. People are free to think as they please \u0026ndash but the vast majority of our staff did support independence.  Walker\u0026rsquos rationale wasn\u0026rsquot solely about nailing our political colours to the mast \u0026ndash it was also about democracy and plurality of the press. \u0026ldquof we hadn\u0026rsquot come out for independence, can you imagine what the referendum would have been like? Not one paper supporting a position held by 45 per cent of the population. It would have been deeply wrong, he says.  And so came one of our most famous front pages \u0026ndash obviously loved and hated in equal measure, certainly by a margin of 45 to 55 - the \u0026ldquoSunday Herald says Yes. The decision to back Yes saw our sales sky-rocket for a while, before falling back to where they were. Like all papers, the schisms and riffs thrown up by the referendum hurt the Sunday Herald. It doesn\u0026rsquot take a genius to look at Scotland post-referendum and see a population which has one of the lowest levels of trust in the press and broadcasters anywhere in the Western world \u0026ndash which is a terrible shame because this country has produced some of the finest, most honest and brave journalists anywhere in the world.  In the wake of the success of the Sunday Herald backing independence, Newsquest decided to go for the idea of setting up an avowedly pro-independence paper \u0026ndash a paper which became The National. I was deputy editor of the Sunday Herald by this time and Walker was trying to juggle his day job as editor while planning to launch The National as well. I tried to take some burden off him at the Sunday, and myself and other senior members of the Sunday Herald executive team tried to help him as much as we could with The National launch. It was an exhausting and brutally gruelling period of work.  Walker says of The National: \u0026ldquoThe Sunday Herald was a paper which gradually found itself supporting independence \u0026ndash the support for independence evolved \u0026ndash The National is a newspaper set up specifically to support independence. That\u0026rsquos the key difference.  Not long after the launch of The National, Walker stepped down as Sunday Herald editor and left the company. \u0026ldquoI was knackered, he said. \u0026ldquoI needed a break. After he stepped down, I became editor."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-keeping-the-flame-of-serious-journalism-burning-bright","story":"  This summer has demonstrated just how rancid our political culture has become. Earlier this week, the former Labour spin-doctor, John McTernan, told BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme that Labour \u0026ldquois transforming itself into the nasty party. In doing so he was implicitly condemning his and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos Labour party as worse than the Tories. This kind of hyperbolic rhetoric is becoming pretty standard.  Earlier in the week, the former Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, a figure commanding great respect not only among Jews, compared the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to Enoch Powell, and said his recent remarks about Zionism were as racist as Powell\u0026rsquos infamous \u0026ldquoRivers of Blood speech in 1967. It\u0026rsquos as if even normally sober-minded people feel that they have to ramp up their invective to 11 just to get a hearing.  It was the same with Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos burka remarks. It was, of course, provocative to describe women wearing this attire as looking like \u0026ldquobank robbers and letter boxes. But Johnson was widely accused of being a racist and even a neo-fascist. The former Foreign Secretary is many things, but whatever you think of him he is not a fascist, neo or otherwise, and nor is the British Conservative Party a racist organisation. Indeed, to claim that Tory politicians are fascists and racists robs these terms of any meaning at a time when the real far right is undergoing a resurgence.  Similarly, the widespread allegations about Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos anti-semitism \u0026ndash not least from Labour MPs like Margaret Hodge - devalues the very concept of anti-semitism. His critics may even unknowingly be giving comfort and encouragement to genuine jew-haters. Repeated claims that Labour is an anti-semitic organisation makes it look as if this despicable creed is becoming almost respectable. Look, racists can say: even the British Labour Party is now on our side.  All this has a lot to do, of course, with the rise of social media. When the Sunday Herald was born, the internet was a relatively new toy. Google was around, but it was still a fact-based search engine run by academic geeks largely for geeks. Twitter had yet to be born, and Facebook was confined to US campuses. These internet phenomena have now taken over the world \u0026ndash almost literally in Facebook\u0026rsquos case \u0026ndash and have turned journalism on its head, as well as stealing the advertising revenue that supported it.  In the past, newspaper editors acted as gatekeepers, assessing the overall quality and news value of the information that entered the public sphere. Professional journalists were paid to research stories and comment on matters of public concern. Now anything goes. Bored teenagers in Macedonia can cobble together some pro-Trump sites and sell them for clicks to gullible US consumers of fake news. There is zero quality control on Facebook. Post-truth has invaded the public consciousness like a computer virus.  People can now believe whatever they want to believe: \u0026ldquothe Pope backs Trump, \u0026ldquoClinton is a murderer and find confirmation on social media. There readers are insulated from alternative views and factual evidence. Computer algorithms create filter bubbles, pre-selecting posts that conform to people\u0026rsquos prejudices, in a form of digital brainwashing. Newspapers had editorial lines, but they at least tried to give a range of opinion, and did not, as a rule, run comment as news.  Endless rows on Twitter have debased political discourse by infecting it with abuse and anger. The laws on defamation seem to have been abolished. No matter what you think of Alex Salmond, or his crowd-funding campaign, the things that have been routinely tweeted and retweeted about his alleged sex crimes are disgraceful and would never have appeared in the Sunday Herald or any other newspaper back in the day.  Some might think this is a good thing, that powerful figures can no longer hide behind the law. But this social media free-for-all is death to responsible journalism and also to natural justice. Newspapers that still keep within the law, look as if they\u0026rsquore stuffy and behind the times. Worse, they\u0026rsquore regarded as part of that sluice of evil, the MSM, the Mainstream Media.  Of course, the press has its faults. Newspaper editors exercised power, but they didn\u0026rsquot always exercise it responsibly. Tabloid newspapers in the noughties spread hatred against immigrants and people on benefits, pandering to the worst prejudices of their readers. In 1999, some tabloid and broadsheet newspapers just couldn\u0026rsquot forgive Scots for voting in massive numbers for a Scottish parliament, one of the proximate causes for the creation of the Sunday Herald.  The early months and years of Holyrood were torrid. There were accusations of misuse of expenses, incompetent MSPs and attempts to ridicule and undermine the policies of the Labour/Lib Dem administration, such as the repeal of Clause 28, which effectively banned any positive representation of homosexuality in schools.  Abolishing Section 2A, as it was properly called in Scotland, remains the Sunday Herald campaign in which I take greatest pride. Alone of the press of the day, the Sunday Herald took, head on, the Keep the Clause campaign, led by the formidable combination of Stagecoach bus tycoon, Brian Souter, and Cardinal Thomas Winning, leader of the Catholic Church.  The editor, Andrew Jaspan, and I, received many threats, and not just of divine retribution, for arguing that Clause 28 was a homophobic abomination that should be repealed in a civilised country.  The row spread to the Scottish cabinet and became a fierce battle between liberals like then Communities Minister Wendy Alexander, and less progressive ministers of the day. The Labour First Minister, Donald Dewar, was almost torn apart by the divisions, and some believe that the stress may have contributed to the collapse of his health and his premature death.  It is a measure of how Scotland has changed since 1999 that it\u0026rsquos inconceivable anything like Section 2A could become law today. An undoubted achievement of the Scottish parliament has been to help change Scotland\u0026rsquos primitive attitudes to diversity.  And it\u0026rsquos not over till it\u0026rsquos over. The Sunday Herald is not dead, it has simply evolved. There will now be two quality newspapers on Sunday: the Herald on Sunday and the Sunday National. The one becomes two. What better way to demonstrate that, no matter what the internet says, serious journalism is not dead."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-tributes-kind-words-from-across-scottish-life-to-a-well-loved-friend-in-its-final-hours","story":"  Farewell dear friend, I\u0026rsquove loved you since you were born and over the last twenty years, my God where does time go, I have watched you grow and mature and take your rightful place in our lives.  You were a breath of fresh air, you came with integrity, you came with courage, you were unafraid of your own voice or the choices you made. You, quite simply, raised the bar and set standards others can only dream of.  My Sundays will be bereft without you, without the joy of reading you from cover to cover excited at what I might find as I turn the page. Alas, no more will you shine your light but the voices of those who made you unique are still with us and long may they be heard for they are needed more than ever.  Elaine C Smith, actor and comedian  The Sunday Herald has been a staple in our home since it started and has kept many a paper boy or girl delivering to us every Sunday. It\u0026rsquos the only newspaper that we continued to have delivered \u0026ndash the demise of the habit of buying a newspaper every day is evident, with people getting their news in so many different ways now \u0026ndash but our loyalty to the Sunday herald continued.  It continued for me because in so many ways its political commentary kept me sane. In a world of right wing Labour and Tory opinion in Scotland  the Sunday Herald was a beacon of light.  Not because it was/is pro Scottish independence  but because it tried to present an alternative view and that was like a breath of fresh air. Under the editor Richard Walker, the paper took brave steps. A country that has at least 45 per cent of its people supporting Independence having no newspaper representing or even covering that view would have been ludicrous. Columnists like Iain McWhirter stepping out at a time when all the fire was aimed at the Independence movement was a brave step and as many have found in this wee nation  when you step out from those who have run things for a long time then you are shunned, or ex communicated.  So, I feel sad that things are moving and that there is no more Sunday Herald but am pleased the National on Sunday is being printed and that will be the paper in my house from now on.  Ruth Wishart, journalist, broadcaster and commentator  When the Sunday Herald took the decision to back independence it did so against a media backdrop which was at best neutral and, more commonly, openly hostile to the concept.  It seemed to me vital that a major title should give voice to a cause supported by hundreds and thousands of Scots, and to offer support for and reportage on the Independence campaign.  It has of course mounted many other campaigns and provided space for thought provoking essays and columns.  Often these have been rather more left field than more conventional publications in the mainstream media, and all the more welcome for it. We need diversity in journalism as much as we do elsewhere.  On a more personal level I was delighted to participate in the judging for the Sunday Herald Culture Awards, which helped recognise the myriad talents flourishing throughout the country in every art form.  I will reserve judgement on the Herald on Sunday until I read it. But Sundays just won\u0026rsquot be the same without my Sunday Herald fix.  Professor Emeritus Sir Tom Devine, historian  Over nearly two decades the Sunday Herald has become an important and stimulating addition to the Scottish ?newspaper scene.  The decision taken in 2014 to lend support to the cause of independence was not only courageous but of positive benefit to Scottish democracy. Whatever one\u0027s political view, it was surely unhealthy for the press to be overwhelmingly committed to a unionist position when the nation itself was split over the central Scottish constitutional issue of our time.  This is especially so since the question of the future of the country was not finally laid to rest by the result of the referendum of 2014 and remains alive to this day.  In that sense all democrats should applaud the fact that the Sunday Herald gave some voice to a nationalist perspective without at any time becoming a propaganda sheet either for the SNP or the pro-independence movement.  The paper was also fortunate in being led successively by three first class editors in Andrew Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay?. They were all innovative figures in their different ways who ensured that the quality of journalism was always of a high standard.  I much regret the passing of a newspaper with such a distinctive editorial line? and fresh approach as the Sunday Herald, especially in light of the current difficult times for the Scottish press more generally. We can only hope that some at least of the traditions of the paper are maintained by its successor each Sunday.  Stuart Cosgrove, writer and broadcaster  The Sunday Herald came of age at a time when I was travelling extensively. It was mostly to cities across the UK but often on research trips to America too. I remember coming across a piece of trivia that has stayed with me ever since. It was a minor bit of detail about the pioneering Motown acts who travelled the deep south of America in the days when racial segregation was still the norm. To protect their stage shoes and to keep them in touch with home, groups like The Temptations and The Supremes would roll-up pages from the Michigan Chronicle, Detroit\u0027s major black newspaper. Otis Williams of the Temptations once said that when he was bored or missing home he would unravel the crumpled paper in his shoes and read about Detroit.  For me it was the Sunday Herald. I was home to appear on radio every Saturday and the next day began my travels again. So, I would religiously buy the Sunday Herald, fold it into my bag and once or twice in an act of Motown mimicry even stuffed a section in my trainers. It was the paper that kept me in touch, reminded me of home and spoke to my hopes and dreams, it seemed effortlessly left-of-centre, supportive of an independent Scotland and connected to the exciting cultural developments that made me want to spend more time at home.  Josh Littlejohn, founder of Social Bite  The Sunday Herald has been a massive supporter of our organisation Social Bite and has always championed the need to tackle social causes. The publication has covered Social Bite\u0027s journey over the last six years which has helped us raise awareness and funds to help homeless people throughout Scotland.  The Sunday Herald also recognised our Sleep in the Park event with a special award at their Culture Awards, for which we were touched and honoured. I would like to thank everyone in the team for their legacy to us and many organisations like ours over the years.  Aamer Anwar, human rights lawyer  I first got involved with the paper back in 1999 when we began the campaign for justice for the murder victim Surjit Singh Chhokar. The Sunday Herald carried our campaign week after week, building a relationship with the family and caring little about the powerful institutions which desperately tried to silence us. The paper was a key player in helping us get justice 18 years later. For that one issue which placed victim\u0026rsquos rights at the heart of the criminal justice system you can be immensely proud.  But looking back over the years, there have been so many issues and campaigns that I have worked on with the paper on that it\u0026rsquos hard to pick the most memorable. There was articles about the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody the corrupt Counter Corruption Unit at Police Scotland the betrayal of justice for Emma Caldwell the ticking timebomb of sexual harassment at the Scottish Parliament. You even supported me when I was placed on trial for speaking out against a miscarriage of justice or faced death threats from \u0026lsquoIslamic\u0026rsquo extremists.  On so many levels your journalists have shown immense courage and compassion but you also gave us hope in the words you wrote. What compliment can I give to so many of you who worked this paper, other than to say you really made a difference to Scotland. There are so many ordinary people without powerful friends or money to rely upon, who would have been pushed aside, silenced and crushed had you not been there with your campaigning journalism.  It makes me incredibly sad to see you go, but on a personal level I just want to say thank you so much for being there for myself, the families and campaigns in our darkest hours. We always knew if we picked up the phone you could be relied upon for your unconditional support. Good luck my friends.  Hugh MacDonald, writer and broadcaster  There was, at first, a distance between us. The Sunday Herald lived above The Herald on Albion Street, below it on Renfield Street. We then grew close. Long before the Sunday Herald moved its digs to join The Herald on the same floor, I \u0026ndash a perennial daily hack - had made the occasional contribution to its pages. These dalliances became more of a regular relationship. These pieces generally represented what I liked about the Sunday Herald.  First, they were interesting. At least in their commissioning. I did my best to knock any intrigue from them. But articles were sought from me on such as the secrets of the confessional, the curious lack of professed gay footballers, and the importance of geography in American crime writing. They were typical of how the Sunday Herald sought to investigate the corners as well as the broad floor of politics, culture or sport.  Secondly, the editing was first class. Kathleen Morgan, the best journalist in Scotland never to have edited a national newspaper, produced a stunning magazine that her successor, Jane Wright, maintained to the highest standard. Susan Flockhart was a brilliant, insightful editor of copy. Any piece emerged better from her examination. This is a tribute born of personal experience.  There was a sense of gallusness about the Sunday Herald, too, never better illustrated by a front page that may have featured Ryan Giggs. Or maybe not. It also allowed some latitude. I began to write more sports pieces  and more book reviews, commissioned by Rosemary Goring, a peerless literary editor.  The rein was so free it could have been a four. I was allowed to write a preview to the 2012 Olympics that consisted of the first verse of London Calling, with slight amendments. It was fun. At least for me.  But best of all, it was independent. It informed you without apology about what it believed was important. It told you what it thought and it oft times took extraordinary criticism for that seeming impertinence. I loved that then. I mourn it now that it is gone.  Katie Archibald, columnist and champion racing cyclist  I first wrote for the Sunday Herald in 2014, the year of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. The sports section had a weekly column written by a rotation of six Scottish athletes, all aspiring to Commonwealth success that year. It was a logbook of the highs and lows of lives consumed by sport. The column didn\u0026rsquot retell the happenings of races, matches and galas, but instead revealed the recipes behind our victories, confessed the insecurities muddled into our losses, and gave the insider view on sports controversies.  The Commonwealth Games came and with it the end to these six stories, whether they finished as fairy tales or not. But somehow, I continued writing in the paper. For me, the Sunday Herald was a platform to talk about cycling. It was inches on a page to entertain people and to subtly convince everyone to get on a bike, and for that opportunity I am very grateful. I was one small voice in the countless that were given the chance to be heard in this paper. The Sunday Herald will be missed.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice Chancellor, University of Glasgow  A healthy and provocative press is essential to the wellbeing of democratic debate and one of the great strengths, and I hope enduring legacies of the Sunday Herald, was the space provided for all shades of comment and opinion. In my own case I was pleased to engage with the editorial team, sometimes to offer just a line or two to a story but more often to contribute my thoughts and my perspective on often complex and challenging issues. From the Fiscal Framework to the economic consequences of Brexit for Scotland and the wider United Kingdom, I was encouraged to provide clarity and explanation. At a time of controversy over what is real and what is fake news, and against a continuing backdrop of those who still say we should not listen to experts I believe with great conviction that it is more important than ever that different and diverse opinions are given their place in our press."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckay-quoting-mao-in-the-office-crying-foul-on-the-phone-and-a-flying-fish-supper","story":"  AS\u0026nbspthis newspaper passes away and a new one is in gestation just a week before delivery, we\u0026rsquore beaten to the punch by the launch of The Herald this Thursday. It\u0026rsquos what Donald Trump would call a fake newspaper. It features in a new six-part BBC drama, Press, as a stately broadsheet, sharing the building with its sleazy tabloid sister called The Post, set in the internet age. It\u0026rsquos written by the screenwriter of the lauded Doctor Foster. There\u0026rsquos violence, sexual infidelity, illegal drug-taking, petty jealousies, bullying, duplicity and bribery \u0026ndash and I guess that will feature in the fictional Herald too.  Actually, newspapers have changed out of all recognition from the rumbustious, hard-drinking, highly-competitive, brawling, character-filled days before 24-hour news and social media mauled circulation and advertising revenues. But these days are something the one-time, short-lived editor of the Daily Mirror, Roy Greenslade, knows about. He\u0026rsquos the editorial adviser on Press, as well as being a journalism professor, and Roy has gone through his own highly-dramatic reinvention. I remember him as a Red Book carrying Maoist, a member of the Communist Party of Britain  which backed China in the spit with the Soviet Union and then Albania\u0026rsquos despot Enver Hoxha. Greenslade used to stupefy NUJ meetings and conferences with his quotes from the chairman and calls for class warfare, but while Mao anticipated Twitter by keeping his pronouncements to under 140 words Roy was under no such stricture. Later he moved rightwards and, for a time, became Alastair Campbell\u0026rsquos best pal. None of which will feature in the new show.  RAIL LINES AND SICK NOTES  SOME ScotRail services were disrupted on Thursday because of an unexpected rash of illnesses to staff. Unexpected? Just check the fixture list. Celtic and Rangers were both playing in the Europa League. Could it be true? Unexpected becoming expected with crucial staff taking sickies to watch the games? Only the travelling public suffered and, whatever the reason for the mysterious bout of lurgy, no doubt the company management and the RMT union will have nothing to say about the inconvenience.  FAIR SCUNNERED  BETFAIR? It\u0026rsquos a breach of the Trade Descriptions Act. I like the occasional wager, it makes TV sport more interesting as well as politics, but all in moderation of course. I\u0026rsquove done it online through Betfair for the last eight years or so. No longer. A few days ago, with my account in credit I tried to put on a bet \u0026ndash which would have netted me \u0026pound150,000, or so my lawyers will argue \u0026ndash and got the message that the account was suspended. There had been no warning, no email, letter, call or carrier pigeon.  The woman on the phone couldn\u0026rsquot tell me why but insisted that I now had to provide photo ID, proof of address as well as funding. Being a curmudgeon I refused, and said just close the account and put my winnings into the bank account from which I\u0026rsquove always deposited money. She said she would. But of course it didn\u0026rsquot happen. So I called again a few days later and asked where my cash was, to be told I couldn\u0026rsquot get my own money back until I had sent them a scan of my passport, the deeds of my house, the details of my bank account so they could verify I had money, as well as a DNA sample. I exaggerate, but only slightly.  Now some might think that providing sensitive and potentially usable information to a company is fine, but not me. It\u0026rsquos my money and I want it. I serve notice on Betfair that I shall be referring this to the Gambling Commission, taking them to the small claims court  and launching a judicial review on their practices. I will, of course, be crowdfunding that.  DYING TO REPRESENT YOU  YOU wouldn\u0026rsquot think lawyers would need second jobs  but some of them certainly do, from driving lorries to opening restaurants, none more bizarrely than Glasgow lawyer Stephen Fox, who defends people during the week and buries them at the weekend. He\u0026rsquos a partner in undertakers Malone and Fox which has three places in the city. Well, the competition is stiff!  BOOM AND BUST  EARLY last week I was in court to hear the eloquent QC Gary Allan, a man who has been called one of the finest legal brains in Scotland. In 2012 he was one of a three-man panel which imposed a transfer ban and a substantial fine on Rangers, then in administration. The panel members were supposed to be kept secret but after then-manager Ally McCoist demanded to know their names, and in the fervid atmosphere, they were leaked. Allan then received credible death threats. Just weeks later, of course, Rangers went bust and a couple of years later Allan went the same way and declared himself bankrupt with debts of more than \u0026pound200,000. Ironic, although I doubt Gary finds it so.  WILLIE\u0026rsquoS A RIGHT CARD  WILLIE Collum is a religious education teacher, which is fine. He\u0026rsquos also a football referee, which is not. He\u0026rsquos a card sharp, whipping them out like he\u0026rsquos playing the crowd at a conjuring convention. He was at it at Rugby Park last Saturday when he precipitately sent Kilmarnock\u0026rsquos Gary Dicker off and ruined what was left of a dire game \u0026ndash and if he does the same in the Old Firm clash today there could be mayhem.  I\u0026rsquove counted the cards over the last five seasons and Collum \u0026ndash excluding this one \u0026ndash has sent off 60 players and booked over 700, brandishing a card roughly every 20 minutes per game. Hearts, who were the beneficiaries of the red card last weekend, even muttered three seasons back that he wasn\u0026rsquot just incompetent he was biased against them, so perhaps he was just rebalancing?  But thank goodness we don\u0026rsquot have the Italian sanctions system or, believe me, there wouldn\u0026rsquot be a player on the park by half-time if teacher Willie was in charge. The Udinese midfielder Rolando Mandragora has just been given a one-game ban for \u0026ndash not going over the ball, play acting or preventing a goal-scoring opportunity \u0026ndash but blasphemy! He was caught on camera mouthing to himself \u0026ldquoDio cane, which is literally, \u0026ldquoGod is a dog, but perhaps better translates to something like \u0026ldquoJesus f*****g Christ. Willie just wouldn\u0026rsquot be having that.  AND FINALLY ...  ANDREW Jaspan, the founding father of this newspaper, writes elsewhere in these pages. But I\u0026rsquom sure he won\u0026rsquot be mentioning the time when, cycling home in Edinburgh, someone driving past hit him slap in the coupon with a fish supper. Or the night when he was locked in the loo for four hours calling for help . He was a brilliant and fastidious editor, although exasperating at times, as all the good ones are. I was there at the launch of the paper and now at its end. The feeling of sadness, and there certainly is that, is overwhelmed by all of the great memories.  The paper launched on a dreich February 7, 1999, from the old Express building, the Northern Lubyanka in Glasgow\u0026rsquos Albion Street, where I had worked in a previous life. We all had those new-fangled iMacs, the bulbous blue ones, on our desks and somehow it all worked. Sitting in the chair next to me was the polymath and chanter Pat Kane, although I can\u0026rsquot recall him ever giving us a song. I\u0026rsquoll stop before it gets maudlin. It\u0026rsquos been marvellous. It really has. But on with the future."},{"url":null,"title":"lana-del-ray-cancels-israel-concert","story":"  In a Twitter message Del Rey said she is delaying \"until a time when I can schedule visits for both my Israeli and Palestinian fans\".

Over the years the Scottish Greens have had many opportunities to work with the paper, partly because the readership it successfully cultivated mirrors our own support base \u0026ndash people who care deeply about social justice, equalities and the environment, and who want Scottish politics to set about the radical agenda which inspired so many to campaign together to create Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament.  We\u0026rsquove often felt that the Sunday Herald has reflected values important to us. The paper\u0026rsquos eye-catching support for independence had solid reasoning, echoing what many Greens were saying at the time. \u0026ldquoWe believe independence is the only way to achieve a more progressive, fair and equitable society \u0026ndash not because independence is an end in itself, an editorial stated.  Ahead of the 2016 Holyrood election, everyone knew the party of government was unlikely to change, so the question became which of the other parties would be able to influence the direction of the parliament and hold ministers to account. The Sunday Herald pinned its colours to the mast, calling for a \u0026ldquostrengthened group of Green MSPs, with the government \u0026ldquocritiqued and pushed from a progressive position.  In February this year, following a budget deal that prevented cuts to local government and brought in a fairer system of income tax, the paper said: \u0026ldquoThe Greens should be congratulated for the intelligent, constructive and democratic role they played. If only more political parties engaged with each other in such a way. Greens are often in the vanguard of political change.  So we\u0026rsquore immensely grateful for the role the Sunday Herald has played, especially on some of the issues we\u0026rsquove been focused on.  Perhaps the strongest signal it has sent in recent years has been its retention of an environment editor, keeping crucial issues such as climate change, fracking, corporate polluters, nuclear convoys, fox hunting and salmon farming on the agenda. It has also maintained an investigations editor, clearly recognising the benefit of giving journalists time to deep-dive for stories that would otherwise never see the light of day.  Over the years I\u0026rsquove been interviewed by political editors from Douglas Fraser during the \u0026ldquorainbow parliament of 2003-07 through to Tom Gordon, Andrew Whitaker and Paul Hutcheon. It\u0026rsquos been encouraging to see the paper giving prominence to equalities and civil liberties issues, from equal marriage to phone hacking.  There is also a potential Sunday Herald legislative legacy in the pipeline, as the paper has campaigned in support of my colleague Mark Ruskell\u0026rsquos bill to create safer streets by reducing the urban speed limit to 20mph. Given the range of political, health expert and safety campaigner support, it has a strong chance of becoming law. As the Sunday Herald said in its editorial in April this year: \u0026ldquoChild safety trumps every argument. A price cannot be put on that.  I\u0026rsquoll be especially sad to see the paper go given the fundamental challenges in today\u0026rsquos media. I believe there\u0026rsquos still a market for people who want substance and depth, and who will repay quality journalism with trust instead of dismissing the media as some kind of conspiracy. So I wish the new Herald on Sunday well, and hope that both online and in print it manages to continue the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos standards. Investment in staff will be crucial to that, and as an MSP I\u0026rsquoll be watching carefully how Newsquest handles the next steps."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8535346.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ex-celtic-striker-slammed-for-calling-himself-king-of-glasgow-after-switch-to-france","story":"  The forward got bombarded after posting his Twitter message after completing a transfer to French club Lyon for \u0026pound20m.

But thanks to state-of-the-art technology, the patterns and shades that once adorned one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most beautiful medieval buildings have now been rediscovered.  Scientific testing has revealed details of the cathedral\u0026rsquos windows, including the patterns, colours and origin of the glass, shining a light on cultures and trade routes at that time.  Helen Spencer, the PhD student at Heriot-Watt who led the study, said: \u0026ldquoWorship was a major part of medieval life, and the importance of decorations on church windows cannot be overstated.  \u0026ldquoDepending on the time of day, different windows would illuminate the worshippers. Evensong would have a different colour and character to morning worship.  \u0026ldquoIf we can find what the windows looked like, it can tell us about what religious orders and fashions came in to Scotland, what saints were idolised, who funded the construction of churches, and where the builders, glass and glass decorators came from.  \u0026ldquoUnlike most countries in Europe, there is no surviving medieval window glass in situ in monastic or ecclesiastical buildings in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis means we rely on recovered fragments to learn more about glass from this period.  \u0026ldquoThe tests we carried out have shed light on the colour and origin of the window glass of Elgin Cathedral.  Built in 1224, Elgin Cathedral - once known as the Lantern of the North - was the principal church of the bishops of Moray.  However, it was abandoned in 1560 after parliament legislated that the Scottish church would be Protestant and made Catholic mass illegal.  The lead was removed from the building\u0026rsquos roof in 1567 and sold for the upkeep of Regent Lord James Stewart\u0026rsquos army. The windows were later vandalised and destroyed.  However, the site\u0026rsquos fortunes began to change when it became a visitor attraction in the early 1800s.  The recent project examining the glass saw scientists use cutting edge technology including electron microscopy and x-ray fluorescence, as well as the first laser-ablation spectroscopy analysis of medieval Scottish glass.  Ms Spencer said the results showed that most of the glass had its origins in northern France, while a smaller section of it came from Germany.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe identified two distinct blue glasses, both containing cobalt. While one was very dark and rich in potassium, the other a light blue that is richer in calcium, sodium, phosphorus and aluminium.  \u0026ldquohe lighter glass was coloured with bronze, while the darker blue most likely had brass filings added. Both these blue glasses were sourced from different parts of Europe.  \u0026ldquoWe also found that the brown and amber glasses had quite different base glass \u0026lsquorecipes\u0026rsquo to the greens and pinks, meaning they were likely made at separate locations before being imported to Scotland.  \u0026ldquoScotland didn\u0026rsquot manufacture glass in the medieval period, although several regions in England produced white \u0026lsquocolourless\u0026rsquo glass.  \u0026ldquoAt the beginning of the 13th century, much of the white glass came from Normandy and by the 15th century it was coming primarily from Flanders.  \u0026ldquoMonastic connections and new trade routes from present day Belgium that connected to east coast ports like Leith, Perth and Aberdeen all had an impact on the glass that was commissioned and used for these beautiful cathedrals.  \u0026ldquoUnderstanding more about these sites brings them to life. The more we discover about our historic buildings the more we can appreciate our history, how people lived, the connections between Scotland and Europe at that time and the craftsmanship involved.  \u0026ldquoThe next time you visit a ruin in Scotland, take a look at the window spaces and imagine them filled with blue, pink, yellow, green and amber glass from across Europe.  \u0026ldquoIt will change how you think about and experience these buildings.  The project, funded by the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland, was prompted by a lack of research looking at stained glass in Scotland.  The Heriot Watt team will now test medieval window glass from across Scotland in the first comprehensive study undertaken since the 1980s.  The team hopes advanced testing techniques will uncover more secrets from the country\u0026rsquos cathedrals.  Dr Simon Gilmour, director of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, which part-funded the project, said: \u0026ldquoThe Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was proud to fund this project.  \u0026ldquoThe lack of research about window glass used in Scotland during the medieval period was highlighted in the Scottish Archaeological Research Framework and this project has been able to use cutting-edge technology to enhance our knowledge of how these ancient windows were made."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-aims-to-set-agenda-after-being-buffeted-by-salmond-claims","story":"  The First Minister will tomorrow outline the 12 bills she intends to introduce at Holyrood over the coming year as she publishes the annual programme for government.

Scotland voted 62-38 for Remain in the EU referendum, but Brexit has so far failed to shift the polls in favour of independence.  The poll of 1022 Scots found 47 per cent of people would vote No in another independence referendum tomorrow, compared to 45% saying Yes, with 8% unsure.  If Brexit was cancelled, the numbers were 47% No, 43% Yes, and 10% unsure.  But when people were asked how they would vote if Brexit went ahead, the numbers flipped to 47% Yes and 43% No .  However the poll did not include a baseline question asking how people voted in 2014, so it is unclear if the sample was wholly representative.  Of the 1199 people polled in Northern Ireland, only 35% would back a united Ireland if Brexit was cancelled, but support jumped to 56% if there was a hard border Brexit.  Theresa May yesterday insisted there would be no second vote on Brexit and no compromises on her soft Brexit Chequers plan unless they were in the \u0026ldquonational interest.  But there were also reports that her former election guru Sir Lynton Crosby was behind a plan to install former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Downing Street.  It was reported Sir Lynton, who helped Mr Johnson become London mayor, had let staff at his firm CTF Partners liaise with hard Brexit group Change Britain as part of the plan.  Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said: \u0026ldquoWhen people voted in 2016, they didn\u0026rsquot vote to break up the Union and risk both Scotland and Northern Ireland voting for a different future outside the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThis is compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again.  \u0026ldquoThe public deserve a say on the final deal, with the knowledge that if Brexit happens we could shatter the Union altogether.\"  Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a devastating poll which reveals there is a clear and present danger to the future of the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories must stop putting the Union at risk and give voters a say on the final Brexit deal.  Professor Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the poll posed hypothetical questions on one issue, but people decided how to vote based on numerous factors.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat the poll shows is that Scotland\u0026rsquos status inside the Union is problematic irrespective of whether we remain in the EU or not. According to this poll it\u0026rsquos already on a knife-edge and the [Brexit-related] movement is very small.  \u0026ldquoRemain voters become more pro-Indy [when prompted on Brexit] and Leave voters move in the opposite direction, but the net effect is very close to zero.  \u0026ldquoThe 64,000 question is what will happen if we leave the EU and people feel Brexit is a disaster - would public opinion shift enough in favour of independence?  \u0026ldquoWe know that Brexit has made the Yes movement more closely tied to the EU, but that\u0026rsquos also a problem for them, because it means they\u0026rsquore fishing in 62 per cent of the public, much of which is never going to be interested in independence in the first place.  SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \u0026ldquoWith almost 90% of polls since the referendum showing support for an independent Scotland above 2014 levels, independence is polling at historic highs.  \u0026ldquoAs the deeply damaging consequences of a \u0026lsquoNo deal\u0026rsquo Brexit become clearer, as Scotland\u0026rsquos economy continues to outperform the UK, and as people grow increasingly concerned about the future under Westminster rule, support for Scotland\u0027s ability to take its own decisions in an independent country will only grow further.  Tory MP Colin Clark said: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland voted by a significant margin to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014. The body of polling work since then does not suggest any meaningful change in that view. It is time to focus on securing the best deal as we leave the EU - one that works for all parts of the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"art group at inveruie clan","story":"        A new art group is being launched for anyone affected by cancer in Inverurie.

The Garioch Partnership had applied for a Community Asset Transfer in a bid to transform the Market Place School building into a third sector hub.                                                    However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Flu vaccination consent forms will be arriving home in school bags next week as the autumn term gets underway, which parents need to return within the seven-day window if they wish their child to be vaccinated.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:48

funding boost from the Scottish Government.A sum of \u0026pound5.2 million will be spent across the Highlands with Caithness getting its share to provide items such as tampons and sanitary pads for learners.Following a recent VoucherCodesPro survey of over 2000 women, it was revealed that a monthly spend on sanitary products cost females \u0026pound13 per month.This had led for calls to combat \u0026ldquoperiod poverty to help ease the financial burden on women and female teens who may be on low incomes.Recently, Celtic football club announced it would be supplying free sanitary products in the ladies\u0026rsquo toilets at their Parkhead stadium for female supporters to use if needed.MSP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, Gail Ross of the SNP has backed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos initiativeIt was extermely successful when it was trialled in Aberdeen last year.The Scottish Government has also provided the charity, FareShare, with over \u0026pound500,000 to distribute free sanitary products to women on low incomes across Scotland.Mrs Ross said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP Government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound5.2 million investment in free sanitary products will allow students in the Highlands to remain focused on what matters \u0026ndash their studies.She underlined that \u0026ldquobasic sanitary provision is a right, not a privilege.\u0026ldquoThe notion that anyone should struggle to buy essential hygiene products is simply not acceptable and we should be proud that Scotland is leading the way in the fight against period poverty, Mrs Ross said.\u0026ldquoI would encourage everyone to get firmly behind initiatives like this, including the UK government.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation. We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Sunday 2 Sep 2018 10:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupSunday 2 Sep 2018 10:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

The First Minister said her Scottish Government was looking to build on “radical” initiatives introduced in the last 12 months - including being the first country ever to introduce minimum pricing for alcohol.            The SNP leader will bring forward 12 bills to the Scottish Parliament in the next 12 months, with details of these to be revealed when Holyrood returns on Tuesday.            And with Britain due to formally leave the European Union on March 29 2019 - something Scots voted against in the referendum - Ms Sturgeon said there had to be a “focus on improving the wealth and wellbeing of communities”.READ MORE: Campaigners vow to fight ‘interfering’ smacking ban billHolyrood ministers will also continue to press the UK Government to adopt the “common sense approach” of keeping the UK in the single market and the customs union after Brexit.Ms Sturgeon will unveil her programme for government for the coming year when MSPs return after the Scottish Parliament’s summer recess.She said this would “build on the ambitious policies unveiled last year, as well as unveiling a raft of new announcements, and 12 new Bills, which we will progress over the coming months”.            But the First Minister added: “Brexit heightens the importance of everything else we are doing as a Government. The people of Scotland did not vote to leave the European Union, but in this parliamentary year we are set to be taken out of the EU against our will - with continuing uncertainty around our future relationship with the world’s largest trading block, which is around eight times larger than the UK market alone.“In the face of this uncertainty, we have to intensify our focus on improving the wealth and the wellbeing of communities across Scotland while continuing to argue the case for a common sense approach to Brexit - for continued membership of the single market and customs union.”In the previous year the Scottish Government has introduced a 50p per unit minimum price for booze - a policy which was initially approved back in 2012 but then saw its implementation delayed by a legal challenge.Over the last 12 months ministers also announced plans to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2032, eight years earlier than the UK Government’s target date, and have introduced a “more progressive” income tax system as well as legislation to penalise those guilty of emotional and psychological abuse, Ms Sturgeon said.            READ MORE: Richard Leonard blames cuts as Scots’ life expectancy stops improvingThe First Minister stated: “Over the past year we have once again delivered significant improvements for the people of Scotland.“Last year’s programme for government contained radical and ambitious policies which have been widely praised both in Scotland and beyond our shores. Now is the time to build on those ambitions.”Scotland is “determined to be an early adopter of electric vehicles” she said, adding this reflected a “commitment to making the transition to a low carbon economy”.Ms Sturgeon continued: “Our plans are ambitious and far reaching, and will create employment across the country.            “Scotland is a country which in many ways led the world into the industrial revolution - now, we have a real chance to lead the world into the low carbon age.”The next steps towards establishing a publicly owned Scottish National Investment Bank will be unveiled this week, she promised.And with the NHS marking the 70th anniversary of its formation, she pledged: “Our aim is to build an NHS that is fit for the changing demands of our aging population - and one that supports good mental as well as physical health.”READ MORE: Holyrood’s draft climate change bill in hot waterHowever Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said the “tired” SNP administration had “run out of ideas” after more than a decade in power.The Tory MSP hit out: “Nicola Sturgeon will be desperate to distract attention from the damaging splits in the SNP over Alex Salmond.“However, the reality is that this is a tired government that has run out of ideas.“The SNP is failing on education, on the NHS and on the economy.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

Between tribal personality politics and lurid speculation it\u0026#8217s been a bleak week for the spirit of #MeToo, writes Dani Garavelli.                In last week’s column, written shortly after news about the sexual assault allegations against Alex Salmond broke, I wrote that the way we responded to them would come to define us.             So seven days on, where are we? In a deeply depressing place, that’s where. In the interim, a storm has swirled through Scotland, reshaping the political landscape, deepening faultlines and spawning conspiracy theories. Elsewhere in Scotland on Sunday, my colleague Euan McColm is examining the political fall-out the impact of events on the SNP and broader independence movement.            But I want to explore what Salmond’s reaction and the coverage of the story means in the context of #MeToo. What does it show us about power and status and the importance placed on the eradication of the sexual harassment still rife in many workplaces?When actresses such as Rose McGowan started making allegations about Harvey Weinstein in October last year, it felt as if a dam had burst. Bastions of macho behaviour, such as Westminster and Holyrood, finally began to apply themselves to creating a culture where victims of sexual harassment felt confident enough to come forward.Given last week’s circus, however, that fleeting optimism feels naive. Seeing the way the allegations have been shunted to one side by a iety of diversionary tactics, you can’t help but wonder: what woman would choose to put herself through all this?Before I go any further, I should stress again that I have no view on the validity or otherwise of these particular allegations. Salmond has denied them and is innocent until proven guilty. Nor am I unsympathetic to the plight of those who are falsely accused. It must be a terrible thing to have to defend yourself against offences you have not committed.Nevertheless, in the period since the allegations became public, the former First Minister has engaged in behaviour which could be construed as intimidatory. Of course, he has every right to try to challenge the Scottish Government’s new investigatory procedures through a judicial review, but, whether he realises it or not, his very public mustering of support has implications for all victims of sexual harassment, who must be looking on aghast. What was his crowdfunder, if not a display of power and popularity? As a man who could afford to pay his own legal costs, the message he was sending out is that he was still the big political beast of yore.             He has also been casting himself in the role of wronged hero. Take his hashtag #forFairness. No-one who was not directly involved in the Scottish Government investigation can know whether the procedures were properly adhered to. In addition, as law professor James Chalmers has pointed out, the crowdfunder does not make clear which decision Salmond is challenging nor what remedy is being sought. Those who have contributed have signed up less to a specific goal than to a nebulous sense of grievance. Some have gone further and said they are donating because they believe Salmond. Imagine how diminished these women must feel, seeing scores of SNP supporters rushing to his corner with no possible insight into what he has or hasn’t done. And imagine how offputting it will be for other women still waiting in the wings with their own complaints.This obsession with Salmond’s plight, at the expense of the complainants’, was echoed in some of the newspaper coverage and on social media. There was much eulogising about his achievements which, while undeniable, are irrelevant. Some commentators spoke about “trial by media”, though, thankfully, there has been none of the tabloid character-blackening you used to see pre-Leveson. One high-profile columnist tweeted that Salmond was about to be cast into oblivion by “a couple of lurid front pages”. What a devastating dismissal of serious allegations. And I’m not even convinced it’s true. Last week, stand-up comedian Louis CK received a standing ovation when he appeared at a club nine months after he admitted masturbating in front of women without their consent footballer David Goodwillie – found in a civil case to have raped a woman – plays for Clyde. And these are people who have either admitted or been found guilty of something. If the police inquiry finds there’s no case to answer, it is not inconceivable that Salmond could launch a fresh leadership bid.            Alongside these pieces have been others asking what Sturgeon knew and when. Though it is not unreasonable to question the timeline, it does seem odd that in a story about allegations against a man, so many headlines should have been directed at a woman, who has been clear he must be investigated without fear or favour.This background noise will make little difference to Salmond’s fate. The justice system is not a popularity contest. But the mood music matters none the less. It tells women there has been less progress than they thought that even now – when some are claiming #MeToo has gone too far – it takes nerves of steel to bring allegations of sexual harassment against a public figure. I should address one last issue. Over the past few days, many people have suggested that if I’m so worried about the women involved, I should direct my anger towards the source of the “leak”, which has thrust their allegations on to the front pages. I do have concerns about the way the events unfolded, but like many things in this case, it’s complicated. As I understand it, the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, who led the investigation, sought to make basic details public at the point at which the report was handed to the police, backing off only when Salmond sought an interdict. Presumably, at the point where Evans was poised to make her original statement, the government felt it had a duty to be transparent. Can you imagine the outrage if at a later date it emerged it had been covered up? Whether or not anonymity is ultimately desirable, it is not unusual for those at the centre of a police inquiry to be named and, in any case, it would all have become public as a result of Salmond pursuing the judicial review. The second leak – if indeed they were separate – of the more detailed allegations splashed on the front of the Daily Record last Saturday was, to my mind, far more damaging both to Salmond and to the women. I don’t know who was responsible, and therefore who to call out, but I don’t doubt the source will be investigated at some point.            Overall, the whole thing is a terrible, damaging mess. One wee chink of light, though, is the way those repulsed by Salmond’s crowdfunder sought to counter the great-man-brought-low narrative with one of their own. As his crowdfunder easily surpassed its target, they championed donations to women’s aid and rape crisis centres as an alternative. In a thank-you tweet, Rape Crisis Scotland wrote: “For any woman considering speaking out about abuse or harassment, we say: ‘You are not alone’.” It was a powerful and necessary antidote to so much that had gone before."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793622.1535834974!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader the right to a longer life","story":"        \u0026#8220While life expectancy in Scotland has increased for the past three decades, there has been no change over the last few years.\u0026#8221 The Registrar General\u0026#8217s report on the changes to Scotland\u0026#8217s population is packed full of facts and figures, but the number of years of life we can all expect is surely the most personal, even if it is an estimated average.                 So the news that Scotland’s average life expectancy has stopped rising – while it continues to increase in other European countries – will surely be a concern. Girls born in Scotland between 2014 and 2016 can expect to live for 81.2 years, while their male counterparts can look forward to 77.1 years. These figures have risen by nearly six years for women since the early 1980s and eight years for men. However, the report notes that “over the past few years there has been a slowing in the rate of increase, and there has been virtually no change in either male or female life expectancy... since 2012-2014”.            The decade of austerity since 2008 may provide a partial explanation of the figures. But our increasingly sedentary lifestyles and fondness for sugar, fat and salt – a habit exploited ruthlessly by the manufacturers and sellers of processed food – are also likely to play a part.            According to the Registrar General’s report, the lowest life expectancy is for men living in Glasgow City, at about 73 years, compared with the highest, in Orkney, of about 80. But Glasgow’s figure masks starker divides at a more local level. Life expectancy for men in the city’s most deprived areas is in the mid-50s. And it is this figure which should act as a call to action, rather than the national average.No one born in Scotland, one of the richest countries in the world, should face a life almost predestined to be blighted by ill-health and cut short in middle-age because of the financial circumstances of their parents. Government is unlikely to be able to provide all the answers, but it must provide leadership as collectively as a society we strive to ensure everyone in Scotland has a fighting chance of a long and happy life."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793588.1535824501!/image/image.jpg","title":"mark hoskyns abrahall proud of global role in social change","story":"        Ten years ago this autumn a financial crisis took a grip of the world, leading to a downturn in the global economy from which we are only now beginning to recover on a meaningful level.                From collapses and closures to quantitative easing and bail-outs, the response to the crash was unprecedented it changed business culture and societal attitudes.            As more people required help in making ends meet, it also acted as a catalyst for the rise of the social enterprise movement, which has spent the last decade moving from the fringes of the business community to a more mainstream role.            And next week, from 12-14 September, the three-day Social Enterprise World Forum returns to the city where it all began ten years ago, Edinburgh.Since that event in 2008, social enterprises have worked their way into the psyche of the consumer, through the admirable efforts of dedicated entrepreneurs and tens of thousands of staff and volunteers across the world.While social enterprises have existed for centuries – Aberdeen’s Glencraft was founded in 1843 – today they are truly a global phenomenon. Since that first Forum, it has visited Melbourne, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro and Hong Kong, among other great cities.From its beginnings the event aimed to bring together social enterprise leaders and champions from all continents to collaborate, share best practice and plan future developments.Across Scotland we have some incredible social enterprises, from Street Soccer Scotland, which has helped improve the mental health of homeless people through football, to Brewgooder, which is helping deliver clean water to people in Malawi.            In the words of former cabinet secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, Angela Constance, who last year launched Scotland’s Social Enterprise Strategy, “Social entrepreneurs are driven by an overriding passion to improve the world in which they live.”Another thing these enterprises have in common is the dedication and vision of their founders, and this is something that all business leaders should be inspired and driven by. These enterprises have a clear purpose, and over the next three days I’m excited to hear what social entrepreneurs from across the world have to say about this growing cultural movement.In Scotland there are now more than 5,600 social enterprises, with around 10 per cent of those formed in the past two years. This is a vibrant sector, adding around £2 billion in value to the Scottish economy.Not only are these enterprises doing great things for those in need, they are setting an example for big business to follow: almost two-thirds are operated by women and the earnings ratio of the lowest paid staff to the highest paid is just 1:2.5.            At PwC we’re taking action to empower communities by supporting social entrepreneurs to create sustainable businesses that enhance social mobility. And we’re backing this as headline sponsor of the Social Enterprise World Forum this year, an event we’ve supported for seven years.Social enterprise has been a key part of our community strategy for more than a decade. In addition to our social enterprise hub in London, we have a social entrepreneurs club which includes 35 Scottish enterprises, covering everything from cycling and football to food and drink, hospitality and co-working spaces.The purpose of this club is to help its members grow businesses and increase their societal impact, in line with global Sustainable Development Goals. These goals were set in 2015 by the United Nations and 193 countries, who agreed to deliver 17 global goals underpinned by 169 specific targets by 2030, in order “to achieve a thriving society in a thriving environment”.With “reducing inequalities” and “decent work and economic growth” listed amongst the goals, it’s clear that social enterprise can make a substantial contribution to achieving them.For Edinburgh to play such a vital role in this by welcoming back the Social Enterprise World Forum, ten years bigger and better, is something we should all take immense pride in.

Mr Davis said he would vote against the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan in any Commons showdown as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox took a swipe at Chancellor Philip Hammond’s no deal warnings.            Mr Davis also warned that Mrs May’s statement that she would not be “pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest” risked becoming an “an incredible open sesame to all”.            He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “No, I’d vote against it, it would be rather odd for me to resign over something and then vote for it when it came back.“In my view, the Chequers proposal - it’s not a deal, we shouldn’t call it the Chequers deal, it’s the Chequers proposal - is actually almost worse than being in.”Mr Davis added: “We will be under the rule of the EU with respect to all of our manufactured goods and agri-foods, that’s a really serious concession, what about take back control, it doesn’t work?“That actually leaves us in a position where they dictate our future rules without us having a say at all, so it’s a worse deal.”Asked if Theresa May could stay on as Prime Minister if she could not get the Chequers plan through the Commons, he said: “Oh yes.”            READ MORE: Theresa May insists she won’t let EU push her around Mr Davis cited Tory MP Nick Boles’ concerns over Chequers, adding: “We’ve got to turn round with other alternatives.”He also hinted at earlier tensions within the Government’s Brexit negotiating team, stating: “I was always the Brexit Secretary, the question is whether I controlled events, that’s another matter.”On Chequers, he said: “I was quite clear in my mind that she  saw this as an opportunity to be grasped.

I don’t believe it is possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions on GDP.”            He added: “I can’t imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU.“There’s a lot of talk about the leadership of the Conservative Party, changing the leader doesn’t change the parliamentary arithmetic.”Asked if Arron Banks was welcome to rejoin the Tory Party, Dr Fox said: “That’s up to individuals, are they willing to believe what we believe, if they do, they are welcome, the Conservative Party is a broad church.”It was reported that the election strategist who helped Boris Johnson win the London mayoralty was involved in a bid to scupper the Cabinet’s Chequers compromise.Sir Lynton Crosby, who also advised Mrs May in last year’s general election when the Tories lost their majority in a shock poll result, is manoeuvring to derail the PM’s EU withdrawal agenda with a co-ordinated national campaign, according to the Sunday Times."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793706.1535889498!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may insists she won t let eu push her around","story":"        Theresa May has insisted she will not be pushed around by Brussels as Brexit negotiations heat up as EU withdrawal nears.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly

authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

My disappointment about Chequers is it actually denies us a large part of that opportunity.”\n\nOn his successor Dominic Raab, he added: “He will do the best he can on the Chequers deal, but unfortunately the Chequers deal is not one which is going to be good enough for the UK.”\n\nMr Davis said he would “certainly not” support the People’s Vote adding: “The point about referenda is that they are once in a generation.”\n\nReferring to the Treasury, Dr Fox told the BBC: “Can you think back in all your time in politics where the Treasury have made predictions that were correct 15 years out, I can’t, they didn’t predict the financial crisis that happened, no-one could.\n\n“So this idea that we can predict what our borrowing would be 15 years in advance is just a bit hard to swallow.”\n\nHe added: “To say what a GDP figure would be 15 years ahead is not a predictive power that I’ve known the Treasury to have in my time in politics … I don’t believe it is possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions on GDP.”\n\n\n“I’m happy to see people in the Conservative party who believe what we believe” says International Trade Secretary \n@LiamFox\n speaking on \n@Arron_banks\n \n#marr\n \npic.twitter/y3rfNQeilI\n\n— The Andrew Marr Show  \nSeptember 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “I can’t imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU.\n\n“There’s a lot of talk about the leadership of the Conservative Party, changing the leader doesn’t change the parliamentary arithmetic.”\n\nAsked if Arron Banks was welcome to rejoin the Tory Party, Dr Fox said: “That’s up to individuals, are they willing to believe what we believe, if they do, they are welcome, the Conservative Party is a broad church.”\n\nIt was reported that the election strategist who helped Boris Johnson win the London mayoralty was involved in a bid to scupper the Cabinet’s Chequers compromise.\n\nSir Lynton Crosby, who also advised Mrs May in last year’s general election when the Tories lost their majority in a shock poll result, is manoeuvring to derail the PM’s EU withdrawal agenda with a co-ordinated national campaign, according to the Sunday Times.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"benefits claimants left in the dark over pip benefit reforms sdlps mallon","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

When it was introduced, the government said it would be a fairer system as it took a wider look at the way an individual\u0027s health conditions or disability impacts them on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, after complaints about the process, an independent report was commissioned by the Department for Communities in June and 14 recommended changes to the PIP assessment processes were put forward.\n\nSDLP MLA Nichola Mallon has said that more than two months on from the publication of the report, which was by Walter Radar, the department has not produced its response.\n\nThe North Belfast MLA said: “The Independent Report into the PIP assessment process published over two months ago made a number of important recommendations including audio-visual recordings of all assessments, the use of a fairer definition of terminal illness to treat terminally ill claimants with more dignity and respect, specialist training for assessors so they better understand the nature and impact of specific conditions, the creation of a list of conditions which qualify for a paper based review as opposed to stressful face to face assessments, and the removal of direct and cold questions about suicide and self-harm.\n\n“It confirmed what many of us working to support claimants have known for some time.\n\n\"The PIP assessment process does not have the confidence and trust of claimants or the public.\n\n\"Two months on, despite several requests, we continue to be met with a wall of silence from the Department for Communities.\n\n\"This delay in issuing any response is doing nothing to build the trust, openness and transparency needed in the PIP process. It is leaving worried claimants in the dark.\n\n“PIP claimants and the public need to hear from the Department. They deserve to know its response to each of the 14 recommendations and the timeframe for implementation without any further delay.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: “The Department for Communities are fully considering all of Mr Radar’s findings and will publish a response in the autumn.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37274967.ece/f1a3e/AUTOCROP/w620/Ferraris_Friends005.jpg","title":"ferraris at friends saturday september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts bus and motorbike in serious collision on portaferry

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

The expanding gas is forced upward, creating the large ‘cloud’.\n\n“In this case, the innermost of the three plastic vessels shattered and the force of the reaction between the liquid nitrogen and hot water propelled it upward.\n\n“The middle vessel also broke but remained contained in the larger white vessel that surrounded the inner two vessels.”\n\nBass, who said the museum had done the experiment “dozens if not hundreds of times”, added that the outer vessel was there as a safety measure to protect visitors and that it “worked just as it was supposed to, absorbing the shock and directing everything upward”.\n\nThe incident didn’t seem to diminish the enjoyment of the visitors in attendance one bit.\n\nSara, who was there with her husband, said: “People were having a good time and enjoyed the show. I didn’t get the indication that anyone was hurt or afraid by any means.\n\n“The Museum of Discovery is supported and adored by the locals.”\n\nAs for why the inner container shattered, Bass said it was down to “thermal shock”.\n\nBass added: “We believe the innermost trash can failed due to thermal shock from the liquid nitrogen sitting in the bottom end of that vessel while our educators donned their safety gear.\n\n“The best news here is that the precautions with the demo protected the museum guests and no-one was injured.”\n\nHe said that the museum would review its safety protocols and “share this experience with other science museums here in Arkansas and nationwide”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch the moment an evasive duck stopped play at an la galaxy game","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The rallies had official sanction.\n\nThe plan was introduced in June and has passed first reading in the lower house of parliament. \n\nBut widespread opposition has persisted and President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings have fallen notably since the plan was announced.\n\nIn an unusual televised address to the nation, Mr Putin last week conceded that the pension age for women will be raised only to 60 rather than the proposed 63. \n\nThe current pension age for women is 55.\n\nThe plan would retain the raising of the men’s pension age from 60 to 65, implementing the steps up over five years.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPeople attend the Communist Party rally in Moscow \n\n\n\n\nThe plan has attracted opposition from a notably wide range of age groups and political beliefs. \n\nAlexei Navalny, the anti-corruption activist and Putin foe who has built his movement on relatively young and well-educated urbanites, has called for his supporters to rally nationwide next Sunday.\n\nPeople appearing to be in their twenties and thirties made up a large part of the Communist-called rally in Moscow. \n\nYounger opponents of the move fear that keeping older people in the workforce longer will shrink their own job opportunities, while older people complain that they may not live long enough to collect significant benefits.\n\nRussia’s average life expectancy was notoriously low in the 1990s, but has risen in recent years and is now about 67 for men and 78 for women.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nA man holds in his mouth a banner reading “An all-Russian protest against pension reform” \n\n\n\n\nProponents of the pension age rise say that rising life expectancies would overburden pension resources if the eligibility is not adjusted.\n\nThe pension reform was announced in June on the eve of the opening of the Russia-hosted football World Cup and many critics saw the timing as an attempt to introduce a controversial idea while Russians were distracted by the tournament’s excitement.\n\nBut Mr Putin’s polling numbers dropped significantly. \n\nA weekly survey by the Fund For Public Opinion found 61% saying they fully or mostly trusted Mr Putin in mid-August, down from 75% just before the pension reform proposal.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"5000 raised local charity memory popular derry man","story":"\nTHE family of a popular Derry man who passed away earlier this year have raised over £5,000 in his memory.\n\nJohn Paul Coyle, was a familiar face to many people around the town and was affectionately known as the ‘gentle giant’.\n\nHe died suddenly at his home in Crawford Square in February as a result of a previously undiagnosed heart condition, Cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe Coyle family decided to hold the ‘John Paul Coyle Memorial Walk’ earlier this month on what would have been the week of his 41st birthday.\n\nBut it wasn’t until after his death that the family learned just how many people JP had helped and supported over the years.\n\n“JP loved to walk and it would have taken him three hours to get up the town because he would have stopped and talked to that many people,” explained his sister, Jenny Coyle.\n\n“We knew he was well known because people would always say to me ‘I seen your Johnny out walking’ but we didn’t realise just how much he people he knew.\n\n“There are still people coming up to my mammy and daddy telling them how he helped them.\n\n“There was one woman who he helped through her pregnancy.\n\n“She was working in a shop at the time and he would have come in every day and brought her a bun and made sure she was okay.\n\n“He helped people with addiction problems and mental health difficulties as well and this would have been ongoing for months at a time.”\n\nJenny said that the outpouring of support from the people of Derry has been a great comfort to the Coyle family.\n\n“I think the grief didn’t really hit me until that week,” she explained.\n\n“It was just so sad not being able to see him on his birthday\n\n“As a family we just want to thank the people of Derry.

They organised Balloons with JP’s name on them and we released them in Academy Road,” said Jenny.\n\nOn Tuesday the Coyle family presented a cheque to St. Vincent De Paul , with all the money raised on the walk and memorial night.\n\nIt was a charity that was close to JP’s heart, Jenny added.\n\n“JP was very, very kind to SVDP,” said Jenny. \n\n“He loved going to the chapel when it was quiet and lighting candles and he was always putting money into the box.\n\n“He would have helped them too lifting furniture and things.\n\n“A lot of people are facing hardship at the minute with the introduction of the Universal Credit benefits, and SVDP help people in a very discreet and quiet way.”\n\nVincent added: “SVDP do amazing work especially in these times of austerity and cuts.\n\n“Every penny does count.”\n\n\nAbove - The Coyle family pictured presenting a cheque for £5,412.58 to St. Vincent de Paul\u0027s Sally Kennedy, president of Our Lady\u0027s Longtower Conference, Dominic Burke, president St. Eugene\u0027s Conference and Sean Gallagher, St. Eithne\u0027s Conference.

forced to wait six and seven months to have their applications processed by the Housing Executive.\n\nA local councillor has explained how one woman living in the city has been waiting since March, during which time she suffered a ‘suspected heart attack’ due to fraught living conditions, and there is still no timeline in place for when points will be allocated.\n\nUnder the Housing Selection Scheme people are prioritised in terms of points, which are awarded for ious reasons such as having dependent children or having an overcrowded house.\nThe final bracket of points is for those deemed to have ‘complex needs’.\n\nThis falls under the health and social wellbeing category and incorporates people experiencing domestic violence, those who have been threatened or have serious health difficulties.\nThese applications have to be regulated and verified by the PSNI or other statutory services.\n\nIndependent Councillor Darren O’Reilly said it is leaving the ‘most vulnerable’ people at risk.\n\n“A lot of these people are going through intimidation in their homes. \n\n“These are people who can’t stay in their own home due to intimidation and health implications, people I’ve dealt with who have come from Apex and Habinteg are having to wait six or seven months. One lady I’m dealing with who is looking for a house in the Waterside sent her application at the start of March.\n\n“Since then her situation has gotten worse as she was taken into hospital with a suspected heart attack brought on by the pressures of living in the environment she’s in. More evidence has to be sent, and neither the first or second part of the application have been looked at.\n\n“She has been told by NIHE that they don’t know when the points will be added and these points are the difference between her getting housed and not.”\n\nHe said the Housing Executive is in desperate need of more resources as two or three people are having to work through a ‘heavy case load’.\n\n“There seems to be a backlog with all these cases lying on somebody’s desk and this has to be cleared. That is then impacting the most vulnerable people here in Derry.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe NIHE website states in special circumstances applicants may have needs which mean they require intensive care and support. \n\n“This need may be met in a specialist housing scheme,” it states. “Where additional support or care services are provided or in general housing where a tailored support and care package has been arranged.\n\n“A detailed assessment of support and care needs will be carried out where necessary. Where a specialist scheme is considered appropriate, applicants will be placed on a separate, non-pointed waiting list.\n\n“Where support and care can be provided within general housing, applicants may be awarded additional points under the health and social wellbeing category.”\n\nHowever, there have been issues processing applications in a timely manner which occurs when the Housing Executive has to manage cases from other Housing Associations or referrals from a Health and Social Care Trust which have to be assessed at its Regional Office.\n\nA spokesperson for the Housing Executive acknowledged that it has been experiencing ‘temporary’ delays in assessing complex needs cases.\n\nShe commented: “The Housing Executive manages applications for social housing under the Housing Selection Scheme.\n\n“The vast majority of applications and transfer applications are assessed by our local office staff with no delay. However, there are a limited number of cases that require applicants with intense care and/or support needs – complex needs – to be assessed by Regional Office staff. This includes transfer applications from housing associations identified as requiring complex needs assessment, as well as direct referrals from the Health and Social Services Trusts.\n\n“It is difficult to determine timescales as there may be several agencies or departments that we must consult during the assessment process.\n\n“The Housing Executive can confirm that we are experiencing a temporary delay in assessing complex needs cases in our North Region office.

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
