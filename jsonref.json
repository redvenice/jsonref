This means that advertising markets are opaque.\u0027Google have, I think, six different vertically integrated advertising services, all of which charge commissions, fees or take revenue shares, many of which are opaque, and we have to accept what terms they impose.\u0027Even the contracts that we sign to use their services are often presented to us on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

DIY store owner Surinder Josan explains the steps that he has been taking to keep his family and his customers safeAll non-essential retailers – including clothes, shoe, toy, book and electronics shops, tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets – in England were able to reopen this week, provided they had followed UK government guidelines to make them “Covid-secure”.That means reopened shops should have carried out a risk assessment using guidance from the Health and Safety Executive. Employers also had a duty to consult staff about the safety measures required. Businesses were expected to inform all staff about the findings of their assessments, and those with more than 50 employees should have published the results on their websites.Shops should now have hygiene procedures in place to keep staff and customers safe, for instance by providing hand-washing facilities and regularly cleaning surfaces, including self-checkouts, trolleys, or devices handled by staff. Employers will also need to help those with visual impairments or disabilities to navigate these measures.It’s not only shop owners tasked with keeping customers safe. Shoppers have also been urged to protect each other by, for example, not trying on clothing or testing goods. Fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. If they are open, contact between customers and staff should be limited. They should also be cleaned frequently, typically after each use.For many it is all new. But not for Surinder Josan who has been implementing safety measures for the past few months. Josan owns two family-run businesses in Smethwick, West Midlands: a hardware store, All Seasons DIY, started by his parents and Seasons Palace, a banqueting venue for weddings and parties.The 55-year-old grew up helping in the DIY shop and appeared to be heading down a different career path after a degree in electronics and studying for a master’s in IT. But when his father developed a heart problem while Josan was studying, he took the reins, streamlining the way the DIY shop ran and developing two thriving businesses.The whole family has been involved – including his wife, his mother, his father until he died a few years ago, and even his children when they’re not studying. “We like to be right in the thick of things so we run them both. With the venue it’s actually pretty easy – we just take the bookings and direct people to our suppliers like caterers, DJs, the people who do the decorations.The detail is taken off our hands. Plus, the main use of that is at the weekend and evenings when the shop isn’t open, so I can jump from one to the other.” When Josan started hearing about the coronavirus in late December, he admits to being scared.“The first thing that came to mind was that the banqueting venue was not going to work in those circumstances.” So, in late Januaryearly February, he took the decision to close the 200-person venue, persuading customers to move their bookings to 2021. While the loss of income was a hit, he decided the move was in the best interests of everyone’s safety.He was then faced with deciding what to do about the shop. “The biggest problem is that my mother’s DNA is part of the shop, and asking her to step away from it was a big no-no. The only way to get her away was to close. So when they announced that pubs and schools were all closed we bit the bullet and shut it too.”Putting the time to good use, he decided to carry out a shop refit, but put notices up saying if anyone needed hardware items for repairs or urgent work, he would help. It started with a few phone calls, he says, but soon there was a steady stream of people wanting to buy things. “It also dawned on us that hardware stores were allowed to remain open, so we thought: ‘If we’re going to do this, we will have to do it properly.’”That decision prompted Josan and his family to put an array of measures in place to keep both themselves and their customers safe. “We put lines outside the shop. We also barricaded the area by the till so customers come in one by one, tell us what they want, then we go and get it. We reduced the contactless payments minimum from £5 to £1 to make it easier for people to limit contact. We also started cleaning the money using wipes.”The measures weren’t necessarily easy, but were well-received by customers filled with confidence that Josan was doing everything he could to keep them safe. “It was hard work – we were constantly going backwards and forwards – I think I did 17,000 steps in one day and that was just in the shop.“It was so tiring that we cut down our hours, so instead of opening from 9am to 7pm we opened from 10am to 4.30pm. The number of customers who’ve come in and complimented us is unbelievable. They say that when they come here they feel really safe. We did it because we wanted to be safe, but it works for everyone.”While many businesses will be getting used to new practices and ways of working, Josan and his family have few changes planned for the immediate future, being happy to continue with the safety measures they’ve been using for the past few months.“We’re going to carry on doing exactly what we have been doing up until now,” he says. Despite that, he remains concerned that not everyone is as careful with their safety as he and his fellow retailers are.“People have calmed down and there’s less panic-buying, but they aren’t observing the 2-metre rule. They’re just a bit absent-minded about it,” he adds.And while he plans on keeping things as they are for the DIY store, potentially until the end of the year, Josan admits the future is less clear for the banqueting venue.“If the government says we can open, I have thought about how I would do it and keep people separate. You could do it with the tables, with the toilets, and the kitchen and even the stage. But how do you do it on a dance floor? Unless you draw circles and tell people to stay inside them.“So the only way I can think of is that instead of having 200 people you have 60-70, and use more of the outdoors as opposed to the indoors. These are some of my thoughts, but I have got to do it so we are safe and whoever is with us – the caterers, the guests – are safe too. The last thing I want is for there to be an outbreak.”In the meantime, he plans to offer the space to a local school free of charge if it needs more room in order to welcome children back. With so much adjustment needed for the “new normal” when it comes to our shops and venues, Josan acknowledges that it can be confusing. But he says there is a lot of information available, both from the UK government and other organisations, to help business owners put the right measures in place to keep themselves, their staff and their customers safe. And while he is confident that he’s been doing his bit to make sure his customers aren’t put in harm’s way, he admits the future is uncertain.“This is a new normal – we’re not going to go back to what we had for some time yet. There are still so many unknowns. At the end of the day, this virus is going to take out people who are close to us. It isn’t good enough to only think of our businesses and economy.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

With women only allowed to have one birth partner and home births restricted for a time, I spoke to women and men about how having a baby during lockdown has been for them and their new families. The project is ongoing.”Misgalla lives in south London and has been a doula for 4 years. She’s currently supporting Cath, who has undergone solo IVF, via Zoom.“I’ll be Cath’s birth partner, I’ve been supporting her since November. Sometimes doulas don’t do very much at all, but just seeing someone else’s face is enough, especially while pregnant women are in self-isolation.”Rooney lives in south London but is currently self-isolating in Bedford with her sister and brother-in-law and their three sons.“I was 42 when I started talking about IVF with friends. Once I’d decided, it all happened pretty quickly. A friend and I got pizza and a bottle of prosecco one night and went through the website.“Michele and I did a lot of the preparation together and she was there during the birth, looking after me.“Gaspar looks just like his cousin Jude when he was a baby, he feels like a total Rooney. Grandma and granddad are besotted. We Zoom with them every few days.”Kara has been a doula since 2017, supporting Becky and her daughter Silver, four weeks old, who live in Wirral.“I started supporting Becky on the day of her C-section, from when she went to hospital to immediately after the birth. Mums need a lot more support in the first week, then it gradually tapers off. Hopefully I’ll get to visit when lockdown’s over. It’ll be lovely to see them in person.”Thando has been a doula for seven years, supporting women around London and Bristol and attending hundreds of births.“It was horrible not being able to attend Colleen and Joe’s birth. I spoke to them on video call, but environment is everything in birth – you need intimacy and privacy. I haven’t met James and Juliet yet, we’ve had a telephone chat and a video chat instead of meeting face to face. I’ve been working with them since March.“We mother the mothers. Birth is really simple, we just overcomplicate it. Being a doula is such a beautiful thing.”Colleen McKeever, 39, and Joe Weber, 36, with baby Mae, born 26 MarchFrom the US, McKeever and Weber relocated from New York to north London three years ago. Thando has been their doula since February. McKeever and Mae were in hospital for eight days following her birth.Weber: “Mae was in intensive care for the first few days because she had jaundice. We’d meet up in NICU during the day, then Colleen would go back to her room and I’d come home and play Nintendo. I delivered supplies to Colleen in the days after. We could meet downstairs but not with Mae. Colleen held her up to the window for me.”Emily de Groot and Rashid Ariori with twins Maya and Joshua, born 21 March“My mum was going to come for a couple of weeks to help – that’s been hard because our families haven’t met them yet. My brother might come on Sunday and wave through the window.”Leah Bedwood, 35, south London, whose baby is due at the end of June‘I am determined to have a home birth with the sisterhood around me, women who are experienced birth keepers who’ve had their own children – my mum, my sister, my aunt – and my partner. At the moment my local hospital have suspended their home birthing service. They should be up and running again by the end of June, so hopefully the baby waits!“I had a socially distanced baby shower. I saw balloons and then suddenly this convoy of cars started coming down the road! We played games, everyone was guessing the sex of the baby, we had a bit of music, sweets. That was probably the nearest to having a social connection with people. It was a surprise, I really appreciated it.”Reyhan Akyıldız-Gladstone, 31, Jack Gladstone, 30, and Aphra, born 16 MarchAkyıldız-Gladstone: “We had Aphra at home 10 days before they shut down the local home birth team. She was born at 9am on the day everyone started working from home. I was quite aware that everyone was around in their houses! I went into labour at 4.30am and by 10am we were in bed and everyone had gone. Everything happened at a crazy pace.“We have no idea when our parents are going to meet her. My dad lives in Turkey – he had flights to come over but they were cancelled.“It’s had advantages, getting to know her and her getting to know us. The three of us have our little routine.”James Dow, 36, and Juliet Cochrane, 34, east London, who are expecting a girl on 21 JuneCochrane: “It’s definitely going to be different. The grandparents and siblings will have to self-isolate for two weeks when she’s born, and even then they might not be able to hold her. They might, it’s so hard to know what the right thing to do is. There’s a real plus side in slowing down and having time to really plan and get things organised. It’s quite good for us as a family.”Nilufar Anwar, 35, Johan Bjerke, 38, and baby Alma, born 13 AprilAnwar: “At hospital, my midwife’s name was Rachel. I wouldn’t be able to recognise her again as she wore a mask the whole time. It’s strange to go through such an intimate, intense, life-changing experience with someone you can’t really see. I would have loved to have given her a hug. But the pandemic has given us time to do nothing but adore every move and sound that Alma makes, and slowly grow into our new role as parents.”Raquel Ruiz Tognetti, 40, with baby Leonardo, born 20 April“I’m a solo 40-year-old mum, and had a complicated delivery in the worst weeks of the pandemic. My parents were supposed to come and help, but they were stuck in lockdown in Venezuela. In hospital you could feel the fear in everyone. Since the delivery, things have been much better, but I’ve been weighing my baby at home as the midwife visits stopped. Sometimes I think Leonardo thinks I’m the only human on earth.”Helen Ward, 35, and Oli Evans, 37, with daughters Emily, 4, and Erin, born 19 MarchWard: “We feel a lot calmer now. the start of this was insane. I was so anxious, crying all the time, really stressed. Now Erin’s putting on weight, I feel better about things. Emily has been remarkably fine. So far only Oli’s sister has met Erin, no one else. Friends have come for distanced drive-by drinks and cuppas so they’ve only seen her from afar. The experience has been otherworldly at times. Erin isn’t registered with a birth certificate yet, so coupled with no one meeting her, it’s almost as if she doesn’t exist.”“It’s nerve-racking taking the bus to maternity appointments. Even though you have a mask on and other people have a mask on, you still feel on edge. My partner can’t come to any scans, so we’ve booked a private 4D one so he can see her.“I’ve mostly been worried about the baby when she’s here, I’m not worried about myself. I think her grandparents can meet her with a mask, not touch. Maybe everyone can meet her around Christmastime. Hopefully it’s over by Christmas!”Sherica Spence, 34, and baby Caleb, born 4 March“The morning we checked out of hospital, I heard them say they had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. I just wanted to go home. We saw family and friends for the two weeks before lockdown, but after that we couldn’t see anyone. Everyone made sure we had food in the house: toilet rolls, nappies and wipes.“That was weird, having to rely on people. I’m a person that does everything myself. Celeb’s dad thought he might have the coronavirus, so he was at his house, doing video calls, making sure we were OK. I’m just lucky that he’s a peaceful child. He’s so good!”Lena Buhler, 31, and Johnson Aboaba, 27, due 1 SeptemberBuhler: “We were supposed to travel for work over March, April and May, but that was all cancelled. The hardest thing is not having a routine – that can make you feel a bit lost. My mum would have come over from Switzerland during this time but instead she’s been ordering baby stuff to the house. After the initial worry and anxiety subsided, I’ve found this to be good for us as a couple. Johnson’s been good. It’s a strange time for him but he’s been very calm.”Nissa Moger, 36, with baby Indy, born on 8 April“Indy was born in hospital and we were home 12 hours later. We were planning a water birth at home, but at that time they’d stopped the service, so we went in. It wasn’t what I planned, but the midwives were brilliant.“I work at St Thomas’ on the labour ward as a midwife and I teach hypnobirthing. All the classes moved online in March as soon as they said mums were at risk. It’s worked really well. I think initially my clients were more anxious because it was the unknown, but they seem more settled now.”Tammy Woodhouse, 30, and Adam Woodhouse, 28, due 9 AugustTammy: “They announced the lockdown the night of our 20-week scan, so off we went to our appointment. There were signs up, but we didn’t really read them, we just went up, and they told Adam he couldn’t be there. We had no idea. I just sat in the waiting room crying! It was a shock.“They let me FaceTime Adam in the appointment, but it turned out I had my hand over the microphone the whole time! In the first trimester I was sick quite a lot, but the second one’s been an absolute dream. I’m a little bit sad I had to spend it indoors.“I’ve deleted all my news apps – that was probably the best thing. I think it was just watching the numbers go up and up and feeling completely helpless.”Esther and Shahin Najafipour, both 31, with baby Milo, born 21 MayEsther: “I was in hospital for two days when I had him. No visitors were allowed. I work as a costume maker for film and had made 85 pairs of scrubs for the local hospitals while I was on furlough. Some of the nurses were wearing ones from the same batch. The midwife that delivered him was wearing some.”Shahin: “Normally, I would get two weeks’ paternity leave, so I’d go back next week, which doesn’t seem that much. It was kind of a blessing to be home as well and help where needed.”Farah Habibi, 28, and Faisal Imadi, 27, two-year-old Araaz and baby Zaayan, born 6 MarchHabibi: “Zayaan was born two weeks before the lockdown. My mum stayed for two weeks, then I sent her home. She would usually have stayed with me a lot longer. We FaceTime with her and my sister everyday.“My sister’s been dropping food outside the flat for us. We were self-isolating with him, but I’ve started going in the garden now. Today was the first proper walk I did with Araaz – he mostly goes out with his dad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b704141fe27ec6006d6cd593011a4abe9a2745b/0_72_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=121557d7e76e697eaefc4d172f56bd5b","title":"black and asian people not seen as readers bernardine evaristo condemns books industry","story":"In foreword to report into ersity in publishing, Booker prize-winning author rails against ‘ridiculous’ beliefsBernardine Evaristo, the first black woman to win the Booker prize, has hit out at “ridiculous” and “misguided” beliefs in the publishing industry, where “black and Asian people are not considered to be a substantial readership, or to even be readers”.Evaristo, writing the foreword for the UK’s first academic study into ersity in trade fiction and publishing, released on Tuesday, said the report showed that the UK books industry “hasn’t changed fast enough to become more inclusive”. A key finding of the study was that writers of colour and their books are “either whitewashed or exoticised” to appeal to what UK publishing sees as its core audience of white, middle-class readers.The report, Rethinking “Diversity” in Publishing, found that writers of colour are disadvantaged during each key stage of the publishing process, from finding an agent, to having to “fulfil certain expectations of what white, middle-class editors want” with their writing in order to land a book deal.The study is based on more than 100 interviews with authors, agents and publishing staff across editorial, design, publicity, marketing and sales, about their practices and their experience publishing writers of colour. Researchers found the majority of publishing continues to cater for what it sees as a “core audience” of white, middle-class readers – “a sort of 50-something middle-class to upper-middle-class white woman who reads a lot because she has time, and she has resources to spend on books,” according to one respondent.“What were they saying? That whiteness reigns supreme, heteronormativity is acceptable and old people be gone from the pages of our books because you are of little importance?” asked Evaristo. “The truth is that good literature about anything can be enjoyed by all kinds of people. Literature transcends all perceived differences and barriers. It’s partly the point of it.”It is frustrating, Evaristo writes, to learn that “the publishing industry is still run by the predominantly white, middle-class demographic of years ago, and that the perceived target reader is a middle-aged, middle-class white woman, who apparently does not have the imagination to want to engage with writings by people of colour, which is plainly untrue”.Publishers, particularly the large ones, assume that audiences are white and middle class, and undervalue black, Asian and minority ethnic and working-class audiences, the report found. “Writers of colour are essentially promoted to appeal to this core audience, which can lead to their exoticisation and marginalisation,” write the report’s authors, Dr Anamik Saha and Dr Sandra van Lente.Talking to publishers about book cover design, the researchers found that “there remains a fear that featuring a racial or ethnic minority person on the cover could lead to diminished sales” – one respondent said they had heard their then managing director, who is still in a senior role in publishing, say: “We can’t put a black girl on the cover of a book because it won’t sell.” Some of those interviewed spoke of characters from ethnic backgrounds “literally being whitened on covers”.Publishers also see writers of colour as a “commercial risk”, according to the study. One BAME respondent said they had watched editors “asking for changes to a manuscript by a writer of colour that basically amounted to it being ‘translated for a white reader’”.The report, which is a partnership between Goldsmiths, University of London along with Spread the Word and the Bookseller, is calling on the book industry, from publishers and agents to booksellers, to challenge their practices, behaviour and cultural biases, to work with writing agencies to identify talented writers of colour, to hire more ersely, and to value non-white, non-middle-class audiences. It is being launched as part of a virtual #RethinkingDiversity week from Monday.“Our study finds that publishers and booksellers do not have the resources, know-how, or, sadly, the inclination to reach wider audiences. They do not see the economic or cultural benefit. Big publishers and booksellers need to radically reimagine their audience,” said Saha. “The entire industry is essentially set up to cater for white, middle-class readers, in terms of the books it produces, the media it engages, even the look and feel of bookstores and the demographics they serve. This has to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0667007008803abd7b8c835eccf4f00a6c32f221/0_203_3489_2094/master/3489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=151fa5cd454d20c1f732a2491e78683e","title":"were back in business uk bookshops see sales soar","story":"First week back after shops reopened in England on 15 June saw almost 4m books sold, with Reni Eddo-Lodge’s anti-racism book still topping the charts“Yes, we’re back in business and our lovely customers have come racing back. We think we are probably at about our usual level in terms of sales, but that’s on reduced opening hours and still delivering to many local customers who are shielding or reluctant to venture out,” said James Ashmore at independent bookshop Read, in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.“It’s so lovely to see all of our customers as we’ve really missed them, but we’ve also had the chance to meet a lot of customers who used us for the first time during lockdown and have come back to us again now that the shop is open.”Booksellers have introduced a range of safety measures for customers, from sanitiser and plastic screens, to quarantining titles for up to 72 hours if they’re handled by readers. At Waterstones in Swansea, staff have been trialling a new look for bookshelves, stocking titles back to front, so that customers can read the blurbs without having to pick them up.Waterstones’ Kate Skipper said the first week had gone “really well”, with “so many customers delighted to be back in a bookshop”. “The health and safety measures have been working well without taking away the joy of visiting a bookshop,” said Skipper. “We have seen good footfall in local high street and neighbourhood locations, with shopping centre and city centre shops quieter. Footfall still remains lower than before the pandemic as expected.” Waterstones is opening its shops in Wales this week, with high street shops in Scotland to open on 29 June.Skipper said that the books customers bought in stores over the last week “have been more varied” than those they purchase online, where the chain’s charts are topped by Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo and Akala’s Natives.“It’s been joyous seeing debuts like The Truants by Kate Weinberg soar as we have opened our doors and children’s adventure stories like Wonderscape by Jennifer Bell – not titles that will necessarily pop up on the algorithms but wonderful books – alongside the current crop of bestsellers,” said Skipper. “There has been a huge appetite for recommendations from our booksellers alongside the bestsellers, which is very cheering.”In Yorkshire, Ashmore said that Girl, Woman, Other had been “flying out the door”, as had Eddo-Lodge’s bestseller, Afua Hirsch’s Brit(ish), Layla F Saad’s Me and White Supremacy and Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility.Why I’m No Longer… was number one in the overall book charts for a second week, with sales of 34,215 copies, reported BookScan this afternoon, while Girl, Woman, Other was in third place overall, behind Charlie Mackesy’s The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse. Evaristo’s Booker-winning novel topped the mass market fiction paperback charts with sales of 18,893 copies – the highest paperback fiction sales of the year to date. Both titles have soared up the charts in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, with Eddo-Lodge last week becoming the first black British author ever to top the UK’s overall book charts.“It’s absurd, it’s exciting, I hope the Guinness Book of World Records send me a plaque but it is mad – especially when you consider the black British authors that have come before,” Eddo-Lodge told the Observer this weekend. “To know there was a surge of people searching out anti-racism books after seeing what was essentially a film of somebody being murdered, I can’t uncouple those two things … The aim of anti-racism work isn’t to make me personally wealthy, and so some of this capital flowing my way will go to donate, to contribute to the cause in some way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e8de79c0f4c35c1bf520ef1a4b9d94013ae09f6/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f7f286c3b89c23bbfd1dacf27764a9","title":"operators of gyms and pools query englands new lockdown rules","story":"Nightclubs also off limits but pubs can open – prompting accusations of inconsistencyThe government has given the green light to a night out in a pub or restaurant in England but gym workouts, swimming pools, nightclub dance floors and even manicures are still off limits – prompting accusations of glaring inconsistencies as the lockdown is eased.The chief executive of PureGym, the UK’s biggest gym chain, said he was “bitterly disappointed” by the delay in opening its 269 gyms and questioned the government’s commitment to tackling obesity. “It is a strange war on obesity that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms,” said Humphrey Cobbold who highlighted that the company had already safely reopened its gyms in Switzerland and Denmark.Jane Nickerson, the chief executive of Swim England, called on the government to urgently rethink its decision: “Prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it’s safer to go into a pub than a pool and I’ll shut up. But if not, examine the evidence, come and see our test sites and let us open.”The UK has more than 7,000 gyms and leisure centres, with around two-thirds run privately and the rest by councils or operators on their behalf. With 10.4m memberships, it is an £8bn-a-year industry that employs about 190,000 people.“We are confident we can provide a safe place to workout,” continued Cobbold who said the fitness industry had drawn up detailed safety protocols as far back as May. “Through our existing electronic entry system, we know the names and details of every single member in our facilities at any moment.”Although outdoor gyms are allowed to reopen on 4 July alongside hotels and other parts of the hospitality sector, indoor sites are categorised as “close proximity” venues, which the government deems too risky for now. That list extends to nightclubs, soft-play areas, swimming pools, spas, bowling alleys and water parks.While the prime minister said it was people’s “patriotic duty” to return to pubs, which are to reopen on 4 July, there was widespread consternation that sporting facilities had not been allowed to start up again despite months of intensive planning.There is still no date for club cricket to resume, even though it appears to be a naturally physically distanced game, with the hiatus putting huge pressure on inidual club finances. “At the moment we’re still working on ways to make cricket more covid-secure, but we can’t change the guidance yet,” Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.The economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is testing the partnerships between local authorities and leisure operators, typically charitable trusts, which run gyms and swimming pools on their behalf. On Tuesday, Nick Bitel, the chair of Sport England, warned that the longer venues remained closed the “greater the danger to their ability to survive financially”.“With the first leisure trust collapsing last week in Peterborough, this is a real and growing risk, with public leisure providers a particularly deep concern because so many of those operators provide activities for disadvantaged groups,” said Bitel.However, later on in the day the culturesecretary, Oliver Dowden, provided hope that the fitness industry might not have much longer to wait, tweeting the government’s “aspiration is to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in mid-July”.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp Sport, said: “We are continuing to work with representatives from the gym and leisure centre sectors on plans for a safe, phased reopening with the ambition for this to happen from mid-July, subject to public health guidance. “We need to make sure that plans are comprehensive with all risks minimised. We are fully committed to making sure the public can exercise and stay healthy, as outlined in our guidance for outdoor exercise.”But for other parts of the industry the “nightmare of enforced closure goes on”, says Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association. Many of its members, including nightclubs and pubs and restaurants that are unable to comply with physical distancing – were in dire straits, Kill said, and needed additional financial support from the government.In another apparent inconsistency, while the country’s hairdressers will be back in action – with appropriate precautions, including the use of face visors, in place – on 4 July, consumers will have to wait longer for a manicure or facial as beauty salons and nail bars have been told to remain closed. The government would only allow these “close contact” services to restart when it was confident they could operate in a “covid-secure way”, Johnson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b627f8866f906b301b53d96d50f3f523ad43029c/341_470_3659_2196/master/3659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3576f05ee0864f17dc995bafc9ea1d46","title":"this generation of tories is complacent about the blight of unemployment","story":"The government understands the electoral hazard of a recession but is unprepared for the grim politics of large-scale job lossesBoris Johnson has never struggled to find a job for himself, nor shown much interest in unemployment as a struggle for other people. He was passing from Eton to Oxford for the industrial strife of the early 1980s. He spent the 1991 recession in Brussels, manufacturing Eurosceptic mythology for the Daily . If he thought the Tory governments of that era were callous in their indifference to joblessness, he hid the scruple well.The prime minister did imply a criticism of old Conservative dogmas earlier this year. The nation’s response to the pandemic proved “that there really is such a thing as society”, he declared 33 years after Margaret Thatcher’s infamous claim to the contrary.Next door, Rishi Sunak was feeding sacred Tory cows into a policy meat grinder to keep up the supply of cash for businesses threatened by lockdown. It was a bold leap for a Conservative chancellor: the biggest single expansion of state activity into the private sector in living memory, funded by borrowing on a scale normally reserved for war.Now that the pandemic is in abeyance, Sunak faces a profound dilemma: to withdraw back to something like traditional Tory economic policy, or advance deeper into the uncharted policy landscape.The Treasury’s current priority is reopening workplaces in the hope that there is enough pent-up consumer demand to revive mothballed businesses. Hence the prime minister’s announcement yesterday that pubs, restaurants and cinemas can reopen (with extra hygiene precautions) from early July. The timetable is driven not by the defeat of Covid-19 but by fear of what happens to the economy if people continue to stay at home. It is a fingers-crossed gamble that a rush of activity will fire up the high street, but not the infection rate.Johnson did not look triumphant when announcing the changes in parliament. His cagey tone did not match the message of imminent liberation. That dissonance expresses an awkward compromise between the prime minister’s wariness of a disease that nearly took his life and the chancellor’s counsel that lockdown is suffocating millions of livelihoods.The Conservative party has changed its tune since then. There will always be a flint-hearted faction that sees interventions to protect jobs and wages as an affront to natural law. There is also a ready chorus of disbelieving jeers from the left whenever Tory politicians declare themselves compassionate. But it is churlish to deny any evolution in conservative thinking in the 21st century. It is just that the evolved thoughts shrivel as they turn into policy.David Cameron and George Osborne took a modest leftward shuffle on the minimum wage and industrial strategy, but the movement was hardly visible against the backdrop of austerity. Theresa May came to power pledging to address “burning injustices” and to “rebalance” the economy in favour of neglected towns and regions, but she had no bandwidth for anything other than Brexit.Johnson might not feel moral urgency to rehabilitate the areas that May had in mind, but he has an electoral imperative to try. His majority is built from the rubble of Labour’s red wall – constituencies that seemed lost to Tories forever, in large part because of the wounds inflicted by mass redundancies in the Thatcher years. Downing Street strategists are aware that the tissue over those scars is tender. They talk about “levelling up”, although it is unclear what that really means.Some of it is supposed to be achieved by targeted infrastructure spending, which is the kind of state activism that Johnson finds it easy to get behind: grand projects, a legacy on the landscape, with plaques immortalising his name and a precedent in Conservative folklore. After all, Mrs T built the M25 and started the Channel tunnel.The current prime minister is sensitive to the electoral hazard of a recession but I suspect he and his chancellor are psychologically unprepared for the grim politics of large-scale unemployment. The 2008-9 downturn was severe, but by historical standards the toll on jobs was modest. Inside the Treasury that is seen as vindication of the 30-year journey to flexible labour markets that began with Thatcher’s assault on trade union power.Gloomy opposition predictions that austerity would generate dole queues reminiscent of the 80s and 90s were not fulfilled, much to Osborne’s gloating satisfaction. There is a social cost from labour market flexibility in low pay and insecure contracts, but that is a slow-burn compared to the shock of unemployment. Crudely speaking, austerity did less political damage to the Tories than Labour expected because a crap job was still better than no job.But much of the last recovery was fuelled by employment in service sectors hit hard by the pandemic. The release from lockdown might put some bounce into the economy, but there was not much momentum before the virus struck.There are plans for an interim stimulus package in July, perhaps a VAT cut to prod people back into shops, but the big decisions are deferred until an autumn budget. Downing Street’s primary concern will be insulating the public from a harrowing downturn. The Treasury will be losing sleep over a £300bn deficit. The Tory party will be jealously guarding manifesto pledges not to raise taxes. The automatic reflex, briefed already as one of the chancellor’s options, is more spending cuts.Sunak has shown agility in this crisis. He has a natural and empathetic style that suits the times better than Johnson’s increasingly stilted theatrics. The more depleted the prime minister looks, the more chatter there is – premature, but not preposterous – about the chancellor one day succeeding him. He is said to be admired by his civil servants as a capable manager and not a fool, which distinguishes him in cabinet. He is liked by voters, but it is easy to be popular while giving out money.The choices imposed by the coming recession are unfamiliar to the generation of Tories now in power. They have boasted of compassion and claim to have discovered the beneficent potential of the state. Some of that conversion is sincere. But it has never been tested in a jobs drought. The last crisis was no guide. If the Treasury treats it as one, prescribing another austere diet, the effect could be poisonous for British workers and Boris Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ee86fba302234e5bc9f5ab2b5786d62745ebbd/49_12_2951_1772/master/2951.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5267a5534b637bc302280c4f3bf4bfa6","title":"three ways for uk schools to improve their race relations now","story":"Instead of empty slogans, schools should treat racism like safeguarding and health and safety and be on high alert. Here’s what to doUK public institutions, including schools, are clamouring to show they are card-carrying anti-racists. Pictures of patients who have died from Covid-19 have had a striking similarity: mainly black and brown faces because, shockingly, BAME people are twice as likely as white Britons to die of the virus. The murder of George Floyd in the US has galvanised people into action, at least for the moment.Some educational institutions have released statements declaring they believe Black Lives Matter. But how, beyond the slogans, do they commit to concrete and long-term change? And where do schools start?Alison Kriel, an education consultant with nearly 20 years’ experience of leading schools in the London borough of Hackney, says issuing statements without a deeper knowledge of racism and anti-racism work only betrays a lack of understanding. When schools do this, Kriel says, they unwittingly reveal, however well meaning they are, that they may not be listening, running the danger of becoming what Kriel calls “laminated, not living practice” for the purpose of ticking a box. A statement is fine as long as concrete measures follow. Instead of making megaphone announcements saying racism is wrong, headteachers should reflect on how their school structures may have allowed inbuilt institutional racism to arise. Jeffrey Boakye, a teacher and author, says school leaders should treat racism like safeguarding or health and safety. “Who is trained to tackle it? What precautions have been put in place? Are you ready to accept that your school is always unsafe?”For Kriel, schools must first work on their ethos. A good place to start is in shifting from an autocratic style of leadership that produces change through fear to a collaborative model enabling open and difficult conversations about race and unconscious bias. Without this, a culture of silence pervades in which important discussions about racial inequality and discrimination are shut down.Emmanuel Awoyelu, a teacher and Senco at a special school, New Rush Hall in Ilford, east London, says schools must create safe spaces for teachers and pupils to explore their experiences of racial inequality. For students, it can look like afternoon “golden time”, where children discuss their experiences in small groups. In secondaries, pupils can meet during break or lunch to talk through their experiences.And for teachers, are clear policies in place for them to report instances of racial discrimination without fear of repercussion?  “Schools must emphasise the need for staff and governors to be reflective of prejudice and stereotypes they have,” says Awoyelu. Doing something once a year won’t cut it either. As the Runnymede Trust’s latest report on Race and Racism in English Secondary Schools argues, schools must embed racial literacy for all.Allana Gay, headteacher of Vita et Pax preparatory school in north London and founding member of the BAMEed Network, says school leaders should question the alienating nature of the British value of “tolerance” in their school. Who wants to be tolerated, rather than accepted and understood? Tolerance suggests an agreement to let sleeping dogs lie. Acceptance, Gay says, shows that “I recognise your differences and appreciate you.”But what of schools that largely have white pupils? If scenes of far-right rioters in London have taught us anything, it is that these settings are where values of ersity and inclusion are most needed. Schools can reflect principles of acceptance and openness to dialogue in building relationships of exchange and collaboration with schools made up of very different communities.Dr Lorna Cork, a leadership consultant, says change can only be sustainable when school leaders are willing to question every stage of their recruitment processes, from what is written in the advert, to where those ads are placed. This applies to the recruitment of teachers, senior leaders and governors.But for Cork, once schools hire black and minority ethnic teachers, they must ask themselves how they are supporting and retaining them. This is not to ask for special treatment, she says. Rather, it is that black teachers want to be given the same support their white counterparts have, whether that be with behaviour management as newly qualified teachers, or mentorship and coaching for progression. The Runnymede report found BAME teachers tended to be more isolated and lacking in support from colleagues.Schools are often full of excuses as to why their curriculum is not more reflective of erse communities. Nick Dennis, director of studies at an independent school in Hertfordshire, says, however, that the capacity to broaden the curriculum has always been there. What is needed is for teachers to “go beyond what is to hand”. Schools should link up with innovative university departments, academics and research students keen on demonstrating a wider social impact, he says.Sonia Thompson, headteacher of St Matthew’s Church of England primary school in Birmingham, says it is normal for her school to reflect the ‘‘full ersity of human histories”, as described by the Royal Historical Society in 2018. A head for 10 years, she says BAME pupils, in particular, are sometimes considered “empty vessels” for their teachers to fill up. Schools often undervalue such children and inhibit what they are able to display intellectually, she says, but all children are “funds of knowledge who bring a lot to the table”. Thompson says schools can begin with a careful audit of their curriculum before harnessing the “rich repository children and their parents bring”. A strong believer of a “knowledge rich curriculum”, she says what is considered the best knowledge is itself subjective, and schools must question this.In her school, which serves a large Somali community, reception children begin with a unit on family histories entitled “our lives, our families”, as part of what the head called “sharing literacy lives”. From here, they explore the history of traditional Somali food and clothing. Black and Muslim inventors, philosophers and leaders are studied and celebrated so pupils view them as change-makers in their own right.Headteachers have the power to create open environments where BAME staff can raise issues of discrimination and racial inequality without being deemed troublesome. Everyone needs to be prepared to feel uncomfortable and resolve to move past this. If your school is in a largely white area, recognise that issues of race are as much your concern as colleagues in metropolitan hubs. See it as your business to teach inclusivity and acceptance.Recruit more BAME teachers. Offer them the early career support often lacking, so the profession can retain them. Recognise their talents by promoting them into leadership positions. Be prepared to view BAME families not as problems to be solved, but partners in the communities you serve. Diversify the curriculum. In short, make space."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d090cc2f19c17fec07d28c158be436f844447a0b/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11426008f1201b07b83c24974f9d94ce","title":"specieswatch invasive rushes british uplands","story":"For native plants, three similar species of rush are causing a lot of trouble: they are invading uplands, swamping other vegetation, and ruining pasture and the nesting sites of rare birds.The varieties are known as soft, hard and compact rushes and have the Latin names Juncus effusus, J inflexus and J conglomerates respectively. Exactly why they are spreading so fast is uncertain although changing farming practices and a warmer and wetter climate are suspected.The rushes are formidable. They grow to 1 metre tall, spread through rhizomes but also produce up to 4m seeds per sq metre, which can germinate decades later. They like poor, badly drained acid grassland, which is made into more suitable habitat by farmers using heavy machinery that crushes the drains installed by Victorian farmers.Sheep compact the land further and the ponies and cattle that used to eat rushes are gone.

Sanitary felling is sometimes necessary to stop the spread of disease and pests such as the European bark beetle. But it is hard to judge how much felling is really needed, and whether the harvesting is taking place under strict controls.Earthsight has uncovered evidence of felling during the silent periods in the spring and early summer from 2018 to this year. Previous research by the organisation found similar harvesting during the silent periods in preceding years.Some of the wood allegedly felled during silent periods is going to companies that supply the Swedish furniture maker Ikea, according to Earthsight. Ikea denied wrongdoing and told the  it would cut off any supplier found to have breached its stringent rules on sustainability.The company said: “Ikea does not accept illegally logged wood in our products. When we encounter any information that indicates wood which does not meet our requirements has entered or is at risk of entering our supply chain, we take immediate action.”The company said last year its forestry specialists carried out several audits across Ukraine and Romania and no illegally logged wood was discovered. The latest audit carried out on the supply chain in question was in April 2020, and did not indicate any illegal wood, the company said.The company has also begun an independent audit of VGSM, the supplier named in the Earthsight report as allegedly felling timber in contravention of the regulations.“We take the issues raised by Earthsight’s recent report very seriously and immediately began investigations with all mentioned partners,” said a spokesperson for Ikea.The company rejected claims that it had contravened the rules or the standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which certifies wood as coming from sustainable sources: “VGSM LLC highly values the FSC standards and cooperation with its foreign partners. Therefore, we never violate their requirements.”Ukrainian laws intended to protect forests are open to abuse, according to the FSC, which certifies timber from Ukraine and other countries as coming from environmentally sustainable sources. Earthsight has accused the FSC of certifying timber as sustainable when it is not.But he said that the uncertainties meant it was impossible to say for sure whether companies were acting within the law. Asking for a blanket ban on sanitary felling, which some companies may be using as a cover for extensive logging, would be counterproductive, said Carstensen, because protections against diseases and pests were still needed. “We are asking for clarification of the law,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0006d04708ed5f45e4bb1c139d6b4c854efb12/0_311_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22537d032f6d562fb4183da6f694dd2a","title":"tackle uk carbon emissions by working with nature government urged","story":"‘Restoring nature needs to be given top priority,’ says Craig Bennett, Wildlife Trusts CEO Restoring the natural environment could absorb as much as a third of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions, making the government’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 much easier to meet, according to green campaigners.Returning degraded peatland and bog to its natural state, cultivating marine meadows of seagrass, restoring salt marshes and wetlands, and taking some grasslands out of cultivation, as well as planting more trees, all contribute to creating carbon sinks, which absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, urged the government to restore degraded areas in order to tackle both the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife populations and habitats around the UK.“Nature in the UK is in a sorry state and important habitats are damaged and declining,” he said. “Efforts to cut our emissions must be matched with determined action to fix our broken ecosystems so they can help stabilise our climate. Restoring nature in the UK needs to be given top priority.”The government’s pledge to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 is under close scrutiny this week, as the first anniversary approaches of the pledge being signed into law. The government’s statutory climate advisers, the committee on climate change, will publish a progress report on Thursday on the government’s efforts to reach net zero, and call for a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis.On Wednesday, the Institute for Public Policy Research will call for a Royal Commission on preparations for environmental breakdown. The thinktank will warn that climate breakdown, the poor state of the natural environment around the UK, pollution and our unsustainable use of natural resources – both from the UK and in the goods and services we import from abroad – were all contributing to a growing crisis that could overtake the country.In its report, based on a year of research, the IPPR concluded that the UK stood on the brink of environmental breakdown. The authors drew parallels with the coronavirus pandemic and called for new legislation in the form of a sustainable economy act, which would set targets for cutting environmental damage. A minister should also be appointed to oversee the effort, the thinktank said.Laurie Laybourn-Langton, associate fellow at IPPR, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the UK was not adequately prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. The threats posed by the environmental crisis could also emerge quickly and could overwhelm our capacity to respond.”The UK’s environment could also come under threat from post-Brexit trade agreements, warned the Aldersgate Group of sustainable business leaders in a new report. New trade deals must take into account the imperatives of the net zero target, as well as the government’s pledges not to dilute the UK’s environmental protections after Brexit, and the need for British businesses to avoid being undermined by foreign competitors that do not uphold such high standards, according to the report.Farmers face particular concerns over trade deals with the US, as the government’s pledges that no chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef will be allowed into the UK do not extend to other animal welfare and food safety standards. Ministers must ensure that as a minimum future trade deals should exclude any provisions that would create obstacles to the UK’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest and to apply regulations to all participants in the UK market, the report found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb99b26bf18f30041654a6bc4e3c66d7757ef52d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=959633dc753902cca1aafa2a7f815521","title":"the science of shorts how to pull off this summers toughest style","story":"It’s boom time for short trousers – just make sure you swerve the ‘Boris Johnson out for a jog’ look This week’s dress code can be summarised in one word: shorts.

Plus, this weekend would have been Glastonbury, so the spirit of imaginary Worthy Farm is in the air, conjuring up the ghosts of Kate Moss and Alexa Chung in hot pants and wellies.Look around you. It is boom time for shorts: perfect with trainers when you are walking or cycling rather than taking public transport ideal for impromptu frisbee games. Also, the are-they-office-appropriate problem is, well, not an problem. (Marks \u0026amp Spencer reported that nine out of the bestselling menswear items in the first days after it reopened were shorts.)The past three months have relaxed our standards of wardrobe formality. Not getting dressed up for work events, weddings or parties has dialled down our wardrobes to the point where what used to look scruffy now looks acceptable – and what once looked like a baseline level of public-facing polish reads as if you have made a tremendous effort. Something has shifted, also, for those who have tended not to be “brave” enough to wear shorts. The past three months has pushed us outside our comfort zone in so many ways. Getting hung up about whether other people are looking at your knees? Maybe we can leave that one in the old normal.The shorts vibe of 2020 is one part Paul Mescal owning lockdown London in his O’Neills Gaelic football shorts and one part Carrie Bradshaw tapping at her laptop on a hot Manhattan night in a stretchy tank top and a pair of boyish athletic shorts.

Cut-off denim Daisy Dukes are a touch too poseurish for this moment. Culottes, which are basically shorts pretending to be midi skirts, are a little unnecessarily fiddly and formal. Cycling shorts are still going strong, buoyed by Lizzo and their usefulness when riding a bike, and long, tailored Bermuda shorts would probably have been more of a hit had this summer involved more urban commuting. There is a niche revival for the buttock-hugging micro boxer short in its 70s-retro mode – think Barbra Streisand in the 1979 film The Main Event – but the loose, athletic style short is where it’s at.\u2028Do not be fooled by the air of pull-on ease, however, because this is not a straightforward look to pull off. Too saggy and scruffy and you inch perilously close to “Boris Johnson out for a jog”. You need a wide waistband and enough fabric to give a standalone, slightly A-line silhouette – not a million miles from the paper-bag waist silhouette, in fashion terms. You need to accessorise, to make the point that this is fashion. (A bumbag will do the trick nicely.)

Back in February, when Parasite swept the board at the Oscars, it felt like he was the new flag bearer for foreign language cinema. However, in terms of sheer popular appeal, Parasite has been blown out of the water by a small Polish film called 365 Days. Maybe in the days and weeks to come, Bong will look back and regret not making his film a dreadful straight-to-DVD thriller about semi-consensual blowjobs.Because that’s what 365 Days is. Touted as the Polish 50 Shades of Grey (and also based on a hit book), it is currently the fourth most-watched thing on Netflix UK and the third most-watched on Netflix US (it’s been near the top of both charts now for two weeks). It is the story of a mob boss who kidnaps, drugs, chokes and all but rapes a stranger for a year in the mad hope that she will fall in love with him. And it is also terrible.Honestly, it’s hard to know where to start. There’s the central conceit, designed to be a riff on Beauty and the Beast, albeit one where Beast attempts to demonstrate his worth by tying Belle to a bed and forcing her to watch the teapot character suck him off. There’s the way that the kidnapped woman’s character development is expressed solely through the medium of shopping montages (there are three of them). There’s the dismal dialogue, like the moment where the woman pouts: “I’m not a bag of potatoes that you can transport without permission.” There’s the part where she does eventually fall in love with her kidnapper, but only after he pushes her off a yacht during a screaming argument about how frigid she is, then demonstrates his innate kindness by eventually stopping her from drowning.Then there’s all the sex, which is by far the biggest failing of 365 Days. Because, despite enjoying a pair of ridiculously photogenic leads, this is easily the least sexy screen sex since you saw Tommy Wiseau’s buttocks pumping away in The Room. On paper, the sex here is at least quite varied. There is masturbation. There is window-pressing. There is cucking, spitting, non-consensual licking, erotic consumption of ice cream, berserk multi-position drone-shot yacht intercourse, and a scene of such aggressively gaggy fellatio that the recipient ends up licking the overhead luggage compartment of an aeroplane at the point of climax.And yet, it very quickly becomes monotonous. The kidnapper will get a look in his eye, and your heart will sink because you know it means you’re in for yet another few minutes of drably shot semi-resisted sex accompanied – without fail – by a song that sounds as if it has been written for the exclusive purpose of soundtracking a local commercial for a vaguely noxious off-brand aftershave called something like Mutiny or Heretic or Insubordination. You know that feeling of dread you get during musicals, where the plot screeches to a halt so that some ninny can sing about their feelings? That’s how you’ll feel about the sex scenes in 365 Days.I don’t have any qualms about spoiling 365 Days for you, because nobody on the entire face of the planet has watched this for its storyline it is a film aimed squarely at a very specific sliver of horny people who are smart enough to sign up for a Netflix account but too dumb to be able to type the word Pornhub on to the internet. So here goes: the plan works. After 365 days, the woman falls in love with her kidnapper. They get engaged and she gets pregnant. But then she dies at the end, offed by another mob gang driven to unthinkable violence because they also couldn’t have sex with her. So, despite everything, at least 365 Days has a moral: sometimes, on reflection, kidnapping a woman and holding her hostage for a year in a sex dungeon doesn’t always have the happy ending you’d expect.

Hollywood has finally come calling.A New Zealand talent agency is looking for actors to appear in the big-budget Lord of the Rings television adaptation, due to resume filming in the country shortly, and is seeking urgent applications from people they have euphemistically deemed “funky looking” in an unusual job advertisement.The Facebook post by a casting agency in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, lists facial burns, “long skinny” limbs, acne scars, deep cheekbones, facial lines, missing bones, large eyes, and skinny faces as desirable qualities.It does not mention a particular role, and an earlier image has been removed that featured a range of police mugshots to illustrate the look the agency is seeking.The booker who wrote the post said she was not allowed to confirm to the  that she was selecting applicants for the Lord of the Rings television series, which is due for release next year on Amazon Prime. But an earlier version of the Facebook post described her as “lead booker submitting talent for Amazon’s Lord of the Rings” and included the hashtag #lordoftheringsonprime. The mention of Lord of the Rings was later edited out of the post.Pre-production on the television series – for which a second season has already been commissioned – was disrupted in March due to the Covid-19 crisis, the New Zealand Herald reported. It is set to resume next month in Auckland, according to the newspaper.The agency, BGT, has been providing extras for the Lord of the Rings franchise since Peter Jackson’s movies were filmed in New Zealand in the early 2000s.It is not the first time that adapting Tolkien’s fantasy novels for the screen has required a search for unusual-looking actors. An advertisement in October for the television series called for applicants who were particularly tall (over 1.95m), short (below 1.5m), androgynous or hairy.And while work as an film extra can be boring and poorly paid, there are always Tolkien super-fans eager to do it. In 2012, a casting call for the The Hobbit films outside Wellington was shut down and police were called after 3,000 unusual-looking hopefuls thronged to audition.Only those who have the right to work in New Zealand and live in Auckland should apply for the latest roles, the agency said.In response to the post , a number of people jokingly tagged their friends in the comments – most of whom did not fit the bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49a6cff68f980b4935841ab97b2134dd3fc471c3/0_37_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9a65171bc0061376a9a5cb03a8b37503","title":"burnley to show support for black lives matter after banner stunt","story":"Burnley will demonstrate further opposition to the “White Lives Matter Burnley” banner flown over the Etihad Stadium when they resume their campaign at home against Watford on Thursday.Players and club officials were appalled by the stunt over Manchester City’s stadium before kick-off on Monday when the captain, Ben Mee, said he felt ashamed and embarrassed. Discussions were held on Tuesday at the club over reiterating condemnation of the banner, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, at the Watford game. Although details have yet to be confirmed it is understood Burnley will project their “One Club For All” message inside the stadium with support from Sean Dyche’s squad.Burnley issued a statement during the match on Monday that condemned the banner and vowed to ban for life those supporters responsible. That stance was repeated in a statement by the chairman, Mike Garlick, and chief executive, Neil Hart, on Tuesday . Lancashire police have said no criminal offence took place.Garlick said in an interview with ESPN: “We need to gather our thoughts, but clearly we need to make a clear stand against this sort of behaviour. I am sure will be doing that over the next few days to make our actions speak as loudly as our words. It’s a tiny minority, as any form of hooliganism or racism always has been, because the vast majority come to football in peace. But I want to stress that Burnley football club welcomes all people, from all creeds, races and religions.”Garlick echoed Mee’s embarrassment at Monday’s events – the chairman was at the Etihad Stadium – and said it was a shameful episode. “We will root out these racists and I am sure they will be dealt with in due course,” he said.“We will do whatever we can to make sure justice is done against these people. Let’s be clear. The plane didn’t fly in our name. It has absolutely nothing to do with Burnley football club and we absolutely deplore it. But we have to talk about it. We cannot and will not sweep it under the carpet.“I was at the game and I have been chairmanco-chairman for eight years. I have always been proud to be in that position, but I can tell you that I wasn’t proud to be Burnley chairman last night. It was for all the events that happened off the pitch, not what happened on the pitch. The game became irrelevant after the plane flew over. But I thought Ben Mee, our captain, spoke exceptionally well in really difficult circumstances. I am proud that he is captain of our football club and I have told him that.”Burnley’s condemnation of the banner on Monday prompted numerous complaints on social media and to the club questioning their stance. Garlick and Hart felt compelled to explain their objection in Tuesday’s statement. It read: “While we naturally consider that all lives matter, let us be clear that the Black Lives Matter movement aims to overcome years of racial inequality against the BAME community and promote a greater fairness for all. We at Burnley therefore stand firmly behind it and oppose anything that may appear to undermine or challenge such a positive message.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffa6661598ba56c2475898359679f581403ad3e/78_0_2168_1301/master/2168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a0c81e1f642f5c3e432bd3ab0b117a0","title":"leicester reprieved by neal maupay penalty miss but stall against brighton","story":"This was a great advertisement for matches behind closed doors. But the usefulness of the result to either team is unclear. Brighton edged a point closer to Premier League safety but know they might have plundered more here if Neal Maupay had converted a first-half penalty rather than send in a weak shot that amounted to an invitation to save. Kasper Schmeichel accepted it gratefully.Brighton could take more heart, especially from a first half in which they were significantly more vibrant than their hosts.As a manager who has the courage of his convictions, Graham Potter has never been spooked by the spectre of relegation. That was plain from his team selection here, which was the youngest fielded by Brighton in the Premier League era. Three of the four changes to the lineup that started last Saturday’s victory over Arsenal were players aged 21 or under. Nineteen-year-old debutant right-back Tariq Lamptey was the most impressive of the trio, but 21-year-old Alexis Mac Allister and 20-year-old Aaron Connolly also enjoyed bright moments.“I don’t look at the age of the players,” said Potter. “We’re fighting for our lives. It’s about whoever the right player is, regardless of the age.”Potter’s approach was vindicated by a first half in which Brighton were perkier, sharper and smarter than their high-flying hosts, who looked tactically flummoxed as Brighton buzzed around them. But the visitors failed to translate their superiority into a lead, Maupay flopping from the spot in the 14th minute.The way the spot-kick came about reflected Brighton’s greater vivacity. Aaron Mooy dropped a teasing pass from deep over the top of the home defence, and James Justin looked well positioned to get to it first but failed to make a decisive intervention, instead tangling untidily with the pesky Connolly.Despite the boost offered by their goalkeeper’s save, Leicester’s performance did not take off. They were unable to pass their way through the middle and made little inroads down the flanks, with Lamptey subduing Ben Chilwell while the absence of the injured Ricardo Pereira was sorely felt on Leicester’s right. Jamie Vardy, meanwhile, might as well have been following proceedings via a Zoom conference, as he barely touched the ball in the first half-hour. The three attackers just behind him – James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho and Demarai Gray – offered paltry service.Connolly showed his sharpness for Brighton again just before the half-hour, when he embarked on a shredding run through the heart of the home defence before his shot from the edge of the area was deflected wide by Caglar Soyuncu.Not until five minutes before the break did Vardy threaten – thanks to a comical error by the visiting goalkeeper, Mat Ryan, who accidentally threw the ball backwards when attempting to pick out a teammate. The mortified keeper scampered back to stifle Vardy’s attempt to deepen his embarrassment.For all their impressive work in the first half, Brighton were thankful for a close-range miss by Soyuncu just before the break, the defender nodding wide after Gray’s shot ricocheted into his path at the back post following a clever free-kick by Maddison.Surprisingly, Rodgers made no changes during the interval. But his team did show a little more cohesion in the second half. Wilfried Ndidi, hitherto eclipsed by Yves Bissouma, began to shine in midfield as the hosts applied pressure. But Leicester did not look like creating an opening until the 54th minute, when the ball broke to Chilwell amid frantic play in the Brighton box. Unhappily for the hosts, Chilwell’s right foot is a far lower grade of a weapon than the left one he used to fire Leicester into the lead at Watford last weekend. Here he dragged a piffling shot wide.Even though Brighton could no longer generate much forward momentum, Leicester sagged again after that, so much so that by the time Rodgers made his first substitutions, in the 69th minute, change felt overdue.Brighton had to defend well in the last quarter of an hour and that is exactly what they did, snuffing out crosses and blocking shots with under only moderate duress. Rodgers said his team’s lull in form is only temporary. He also found amusement in reports from Spain that Leicester had agreed the transfer of William Carvalho from Real Betis. “I’m surprised by that,” he said with a chuckle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0c2239ec31ab5d2a803872a3fc71183e4bd600/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62d7373173c739db43fe9fbee2955d5","title":"brands fans and influencers why social media for small business is about more than sales","story":"Standing out online can transform a business, but it takes focus and strategy. Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

It notes, however, the move is a “calculated gamble to head off economic disaster”.The Express takes a similar tack. It uses a picture of the prime minister with beer held aloft alongside the headline: “Cheers Boris! Here’s to a brighter Britain”. It tempers the joy with a message across the top: “PM: we’re coming out of hibernation but virus still a risk”.  also uses the pub theme with “Get the beers in”.The prime minister’s “hibernation” comment was the pick of the rest of the papers. balances the relief with the still-serious dangers the virus poses. “PM hails ‘end of hibernation’ – but scientists urge caution” is the headline, beside a grim-faced Johnson delivering the news of the “one-metre plus” rules coming in on 4 July.The  quotes Johnson for its headline: “Our hibernation is beginning to end, the bustle is coming back”. Underneath, a comment piece by associate editor Camilla Tominey is headlined: “So we gingerly get back to normal – in a world that is anything but”.The Times has a straightforward: “Hibernation at an end” and a handy box of the incoming guidelines at a glance. It also joins other papers in looking at the life and death of film financier Steve Bing.The Mirror appears more discombobulated than celebratory in its treatment of the guidelines. “Life … but not as we know it”, is the headline above “Britain unlocked”.The FT gives the bottom half of its front to the coronavirus news. “Johnson gives green light to reopen pubs despite “great worries” of chief adviser,” is their headline but the main story is about the arrest of former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun on suspicion of falsifying accounts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae956433353876b2c0230b183d8588e2f357516d/72_23_621_372/master/621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64e2177d6b9df0e1516f9d295f49c0de","title":"benjamin baker timothy ridout review wigmore hall bbc radio 3","story":"Wigmore HallBBC Radio 3The repertoire for the pairing of these two instruments is not particularly distinguished, but these fine string players showcased the best of itEven the most passionate violinists and viola-players would hardly claim that the duo repertoire for their instruments is particularly distinguished. Take away arrangements of pieces originally intended for other forces, and the number of genuinely worthwhile pieces expressly intended for violin and viola without the support of a keyboard or a bass instrument shrinks further, though Benjamin Baker and Timothy Ridout included two of the best of that small list in their lunchtime recital.Mozart’s B flat Duo K424 was one of two that he composed in Salzburg in 1783 to complete a set of six that Michael Haydn (younger brother of Franz Joseph) had been unable to finish, while Martinů’s Three Madrigals for violin and viola, were in turn inspired by Mozart’s examples. As Baker and Ridout showed, both composers treat the two instruments as equal partners. In the set of variations that ends the Mozart duo in particular, Ridout made the most of the opportunities that are given to the viola, while in the Martinů their playing was wonderfully unanimous, so that the two instruments sometimes seemed to become a single musical entity.An early piece by Sibelius, a duo that he composed for a couple of his students, separated the Mozart and Martinů, and the Sarabande and Variations on a Theme by Handel by Johan Halvorsen, a younger contemporary of Grieg, followed them. There was not much substance in either work, and Baker and Ridout could never quite dispel the feeling that such a programme did not really demonstrate what fine young string players they both are.• Available on BBC Sounds and Wigmore Hall live.

Leeds city council said it faced a £200m shortfall, forcing it to freeze vacancies and all non-essential spending. Manchester, Liverpool, Luton and Wiltshire have also signalled that they face serious difficulties.Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said councils faced a huge financial black hole. “By law councils will be forced to make devastating in-year cuts that will see frail older people denied care, libraries and leisure centres shut for good and bins left unemptied.”Last week the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, warned at prime minister’s questions that councils faced “cutting core services or facing bankruptcy”, adding that “either outcome will harm communities and mean local services can’t reopen”.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week that while all councils were hit by extra Covid-19 costs and income losses, councils in more deprived communities where problems of ill-health and poverty were greater were likely to face bigger pressure on services in the long term.As well as costs in areas such as adult social care local authorities are increasingly concerned that the pandemic is storing up rising costs in other areas as lockdown eases. These include:Local authorities are required by law to balance their budget each year, meaning they are unable to carry over financial deficits into future years. If they are unable to cover costs with resources, they are obliged to issue a section 114 statement, an effective declaration of insolvency.Only one council – Tory-controlled Northamptonshire – has issued a section 114 notice in the past two decades. In that case spending was frozen and government-appointed commissioners sent in to oversee the authority, which was forced to implement drastic cuts to rebalance its books.The Centre for Progressive Policy study used official Covid-19 returns filed by English councils to the government detailing extra costs and income losses in March and April and projected forward to the end of the financial year.Simon Clarke, the minister for local government, said: “We’re giving councils an unprecedented package of support, including £3.2bn non-ringfenced emergency funding, to tackle the pressures they have told us they’re facing.“Councils’ core spending power rose by over £2.9bn this financial year even before additional emergency funding was announced.“This is part of a wider package of support from across government for local communities and businesses – totalling over £27bn including grants, business rate relief and for local transport. We are working on a comprehensive plan to ensure councils’ financial sustainability over the financial year ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ff6ac560668e4f17a928819276f958ea2810ac/0_0_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce0017cd4068bb99946de8abf8815814","title":"treasury announces 85m for rough sleeper accommodation","story":"People housed in hotels in England during the pandemic won’t have to return to streetsAn extra £85m has been announced by the Treasury to provide emergency accommodation for 5,400 rough sleepers who have been placed in hotels in England for the duration of the pandemic, avoiding them having to return to the streets when the hotels reopen to the public this summer.The extra money will allow councils to rehouse rough sleepers in student accommodation and to find alternative spaces elsewhere until more permanent housing is found.Dame Louise Casey, the chair of the Covid-19 rough sleeping taskforce, said she was extremely relieved the extra money had been allocated, allowing charities and councils longer to work to find long-term housing for those rough sleepers who have been staying in Ibis, Holiday Inn and Travelodge hotels at the government’s expense since the end of March.“This will make sure that local authorities and others don’t have to put people back out on the street. I think it would be, frankly, inhuman – because we’ve given people a taste of life off the street and a taste of life where you get your health looked after. The last think we want is for anyone to go back,” she said. The funding meant she could “guarantee” that nobody would have to leave to return to a life on the streets.Securing the funding had “taken a little bit longer than I would have liked”, Casey said. “But now we can assure people that nobody goes back.”While it was unrealistic to expect the country’s rough sleeping crisis to have been entirely solved during the pandemic period, she said progress was being made, although inevitably some people might make a choice to return to rough sleeping.Casey also stressed the significance of having avoided known Covid-19 deaths among England’s homeless population.Casey said it had been a privilege to work on the unprecedented drive to get rough sleepers into hotels within the space of about three days as lockdown was announced in March. “It’s been absolutely great to give people the knowledge that there is another life off the street,” she said. She said it had inspiring to see the transformation of many people who had come into hotels “emaciated” and unwell.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “In recent months, I have seen a huge effort across the country to keep almost 15,000 vulnerable people off the streets. This has been vital to ensure their safety during the peak of the pandemic and has changed the lives of thousands for the better.“The additional funding announced today will allow us to continue to support these iniduals – giving them access to the accommodation and support they need now while we continue with plans to deliver thousands of long-term homes in the coming months.”Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis, called the extra funding “a real step forward”, but added: “Money alone will not provide a guarantee of safe and secure accommodation during and after this public health crisis. We need emergency legal measures to ensure that every local council can provide housing support to everyone experiencing homelessness, regardless of their immigration status.“Across the country, we know that support is patchy and inconsistent, with councils often uncertain who they should be helping, and in need of clarity and direction from government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21893a6e3c51d167095f69856d81bedd49cd426c/0_0_1680_1009/master/1680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc06f72066d78ba622968e8657f02687","title":"clare in the community the archers spaces out","story":"Desperate times in Ambridge"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca39af6af96c474ac23aef648ab3e9fdb606193/95_63_4638_2782/master/4638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0d6d4806bc726be5649cc81db3e71db","title":"cameron champ the latest pga tour golfer to test positive for coronavirus","story":"Cameron Champ has become the second player in a mere five-day window of the PGA Tour’s resumption to test positive for Covid-19. The 25-year-old American insisted he felt “great” despite the outcome, which was discovered during pre-tournament screening for the Travelers Championship. Champ now faces a mandatory spell of at least 10 days in isolation.Focus sharpened towards the PGA Tour’s protocols after Nick Watney tested positive for Covid-19 immediately before his second round at last week’s RBC Heritage event. Champ did not play in that tournament but competed in all four rounds of the Charles Schwab Challenge a week earlier, which marked the PGA Tour’s restart after a three-month break.“I feel great physically and I was obviously surprised and disappointed to learn of the test result,” said Champ. “It’s important now to take the necessary steps and measures to protect others, including my loved ones.”The PGA Tour is expected to release a full set of testing results on Wednesday. Naturally, there will be concern at the extent to which Covid-19 could spread as professional golf in the United States continues from state to state. Spectators are scheduled to be allowed back into the PGA Tour from mid-July.Before news of Champ’s situation emerged, Jordan Spieth suggested protocols might be tightened on account of Watney’s result. “We’re going to continue to make minor adjustments,” said Spieth. “I think the idea of extra testing has come around. The idea of mandatory tests for anyone who was even within six feet, whether they made physical contact with somebody who had a positive test, making those kind of mandatory, because the testing is very, very easy. It goes very quickly. “Sure, it’s uncomfortable for a second, but being able to mitigate the risk is the number one priority. We’ve looked into having dinner options so to keep the bubble even smaller. There are adjustments that are being talked about and will be they’ll be made as we move on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8195394b2cdd5e2f02de2b6f0eed3b62794e54d4/0_83_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0951d9c3fb17926fb00499e8e73763b0","title":"fbi investigation bubba wallace noose nascar","story":"The FBI says that the noose found in the team garage of Bubba Wallace, Nascar’s only black full-time driver, was not part of a hate crime.“The FBI report concludes, and photographic evidence confirms, that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall,” Nascar said in a statement. “This was obviously well before the 43 team’s arrival and garage assignment.“We appreciate the FBI’s quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing.”The FBI said there will be no charges over the incident.A crew member found the noose at the Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday and it was reported to Nascar. An investigation involving the justice department and FBI was launched on Monday, two weeks after Wallace had started a successful campaign to remove the Confederate flag from Nascar events. The removal was not welcomed by some fans who paraded the flag outside the Talladega track at the weekend.Before Monday’s race at Talladega, Wallace was given a stirring show of support by his fellow drivers and the pit crews, who pushed his car to the front of the grid. Wallace broke down in tears after the gesture.“This sport is changing,” Wallace said after the race. “The prerace deal was probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to witness in my life. From all the supporters, from drivers to crew members, everybody here, the badass fan base, thank you guys for coming out. This is truly incredible, and I’m glad to be a part of this sport.”Nascar has only had four black drivers in its 72-year history, and has long been known for elements of racism in its fanbase. Another noose was found at a racetrack in California on Saturday, and an investigation is yet to be concluded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cbe68df41ea9032ab72b2a02e7af66a157ed77f/0_9_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8c21c6e72eaa264a34c1e4c836ba49","title":"hancock tried to block plan to build 400 homes in newmarket","story":"Exclusive: health secretary claimed scheme would damage horse racing industry, from which he received donationsThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, repeatedly urged fellow Conservative ministers to block a plan to build 400 homes and a primary school in his constituency, claiming it would damage the horse racing industry.His opposition to the development came as senior figures in horse racing leading the opposition made financial donations to him.Rachel Hood, the then Conservative mayor of Newmarket, and her husband, John Gosden, a prominent horseracing trainer who gave evidence opposing the scheme at the public inquiry, each gave Hancock £10,000 in December 2018 and May last year respectively.Tattersalls, the Newmarket-based racehorse valuers and auctioneers, who were also prominent opponents of the housing development on behalf of the racing industry, have consistently donated money to Hancock’s office, including £15,000 in May 2010 when he was first elected as MP for the West Suffolk constituency, and £10,000 in May last year.In July 2015 the scheme was recommended for approval by a planning inspector who decided after a public inquiry that “the risk to the horse racing industry is very small”.Two months later, Hancock wrote to the then housing minister, Brandon Lewis, maintaining that the development would damage the industry and should be rejected for its “exceptional negative economic impact on the local economy”.Sajid Javid, the then Conservative communities and local government secretary, blocked the project in August 2016. However, this was overturned by the high court in 2017, in a judgment that described Javid’s decision as “a complete and unexplained volte face” from a previous favourable government assessment of the plans, and noted the inspector’s finding that there was a clear need for more housing in Newmarket.Hancock nevertheless wrote to Javid after that judgment, again urging that the development be halted. He also wrote to the then housing minister James Brokenshire in July 2018, stressing his opposition to the scheme. After another public inquiry last year, in which the inspector again approved the development, Hancock wrote to the current communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, in September, attaching the legal case made by the horse racing industry to oppose the scheme. On 12 March, however, Jenrick accepted the inspector’s recommendation and finally approved the development.Hancock has accepted donations, including some hospitality, from senior figures in the horse racing industry since he was first elected MP, including badges and car passes for Newmarket races in 2010 and 2011 valued at just under £800, and in July 2010, honorary membership of the prestigious Jockey Club Rooms, worth £1,356.In August 2012, Hancock, a keen rider himself, won an amateur race in Newmarket on Dick Doughtywylie, a horse then owned by Hood and trained by Gosden. Hood marshalled the opposition on behalf of the horse racing industry to the Hatchfield farm development via the Save Historic Newmarket group, which she founded. On her register of interests at West Suffolk council, Hood also declares membership of the Racehorse Owners Association, Thoroughbred Breeders Association and Jockey Club Rooms.A spokesman for Hancock said he stood by his interventions in opposition to the development, and pointed out that he also received financial donations from a racehorse owner, Bill Gredley, who supported the scheme. Gredley told the  he supported the scheme in a personal capacity, not representing the horse racing industry, because he felt “the people of Newmarket wanted some houses”. Tattersalls, also described in the high court judgment as having represented the horse racing industry at the planning inquiry, told the : “We have made donations either directly to our local MP or to the West Suffolk Conservative Association for the past 25 years … Our donations have never been related to any specific local issues, but have always reflected our support for our local MPs who we believe have historically represented the constituency extremely well.”Hood and Gosden did not respond to questions from the  about their donations to Hancock.Claire Unwin, who unsuccessfully opposed Hancock for Labour in December’s general election, said: “The Hatchfield farm plans had very strong support in the local community because there is a great need for more homes, and affordable housing, so that people don’t have to move out of Newmarket. Matt Hancock was acting against the wider interests of the community and solely on the side of the horse racing industry, whose elite have been making financial donations to him.”The spokesman for Hancock, who has pointed out that all his financial donations are properly declared, said: “Matt is grateful for the  highlighting how hard he campaigns for his constituency. He has opposed this development since before he was first elected MP. He is very grateful for all the support he receives from all quarters working hard for his constituency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce56307494ed2b4dbc38958782639b0e95888e53/0_108_2831_1698/master/2831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db70967a8075eb297bdef029ec87fd76","title":"novak djokovic has used his influence irresponsibly and now reality has struck","story":"World No 1’s stock has taken a pounding as ill-fated Adria Tour brutally acquaints tennis people with pandemic realitiesSome of the details were striking. After two weeks of bros prancing around big crowds in the middle of a pandemic, everyone was suddenly wearing a mask for the first time. The photos also underlined how young the players involved were. Borna Coric, who also contracted the virus, Alexander Zverev, Donna Vekic and Andrey Rublev are grown enough to be responsible for their own decisions, but there needed to be better guidance from the elders around them. Most importantly, there was one absence. Arguably the best tennis player of all time had invited them all to his event and exposed them to unsafe conditions, but as they nervously waited he was nowhere to be seen.It is now known that Novak Djokovic crossed borders with coronavirus in his system, as his long-awaited statement confirmed on Tuesday, marking an apt conclusion to a surreal saga. The schadenfreude has already started, but this is serious. This entire lockdown has been catastrophic for Djokovic’s reputation, dating back to those vaccine discussions and his Instagram live talks with numerous snake oil salesmen. People cackled at how loud and wrong Djokovic’s pseudoscientific assertions were, but the sight of Djokovic gullibly noting down each nonsensical belief spouted towards him was just disappointing and sad.There have been fiery discussions about how dangerous the word of a tennis player could even be, and now we have a clear conclusion. When people first stared at those crammed Belgrade crowds in horror, he reflexively pointed out that those criticisms stemmed from “the West”. They perhaps only emboldened the will to showcase Serbia’s mistaken “victory” over the virus. Opinions stemming from countries such as Britain and the US indeed can be sanctimonious and grating, but there is also such a thing as common sense. There are basic scientific realities that have been relayed for months, which have been badly ignored.Reality is something that male tennis players in general have not been part of for three months. Grigor Dimitrov is one of the most pleasant people in the sport but, as with the likes of Dominic Thiem and Zverev, he has spent the past few weeks traipsing around the globe in the middle of a pandemic, apparently without ever imagining he could catch and spread the virus himself. That, too, is dangerous.In his statement on Tuesday, Djokovic underlined the wish to hold the tournament for philanthropic reasons. There is a conversation to be had about nationalistic beliefs, but it is easy to believe he sincerely wanted to promote unity among some of his neighbours. As he showed the world the beautiful Zadar old town, the Croat media were taken by him: “Croatia is watching the best tennis player of all time, a charismatic athlete and friend of our country,” wrote 24sata.hr. A couple of weeks later, he was due to travel to Bosnia where the Serb would face his Bosnian friend Damir Dzumhur, who was born there during the war in the 1990s. They would have played in Sarajevo.Instead, along with the Serb and Croat federations that were so swept up in hosting the best player in the world, they too failed to take all precautions in the middle of a pandemic to keep their audience safe. Around a dozen prominent people have tested positive. Since all indications underlined that an event such as this involving Djokovic was coming, there isn’t much to learn from it. Who knows how many other people were touched by the virus as they stood amid large crowds, or by the droplets left in Djokovic’s and Dimitrov’s wake as they crossed borders to reach home. A measure of the consequence of every decision: Monaco hadn’t registered a single coronavirus case for a full three weeks. On 21 June, the streak was broken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4899c5f4db7191fdfbc80c40b197ac92aa66a529/185_175_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7815603a448bef0f903932580d8b041e","title":"apple ios 14 new features coming to ipad and iphone","story":"Firm announces latest innovations including for iPad and watch at US conferenceApple has announced the latest features heading to user iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches this summer.At the firm’s first virtual World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple showed off iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and watch OS 7, due to be released later this year as free updates.Last year’s iOS 13 introduced changes centred around privacy and speed, plus Dark Mode, but also came packed with bugs requiring a series of updates to fix various issues.This year Apple is concentrating customisation options to iOS 14. For the first time users will be able to view all their installed apps in a list view called App Library, similar to that available on most Android smartphones, which automatically sorts apps into large category folders or a searchable list. Users can also hide apps from the rest of the home screens by hiding pages.Apple is also adding widgets to the main home screen, which sit between app icons, including one that automatically selects time-dependent information called smartstack. Siri has been brought directly to the home screen as a pop-up overlay, rather than its own page that takes over the screen.Alongside offline, on-device voice transcription for dictation, Apple is also launching the Translate app, which is a direct competitor to Google’s Translate, capable of translating speech and text offline in 11 languages.Apple has also made tweaks to iMessage, with pinned messages, WhatsApp-like @-mentions and improvements to groups. Apple’s vastly improved Maps are also expanding to the UK, Ireland and Canada, with new cycling routes, new electric vehicle directions with charging information and saveable exploration guides.Apple is also looking to turn the iPhone into a car key with its new contactless CarKey feature that allows your iPhone to unlock a car using NFC. The feature is rolling out to both iOS 13 and the new iOS 14. The 2021 BMW 5 series will be the first car to support it.A new feature for the App Store called App Clips allows you to access some functions of an app that may be needed to access a service, without downloading the full app.Apple is also bringing more awareness of privacy to the App Store with privacy practices displayed from apps, covering what data they collect and which companies it is shared with, before you download them. It is also allowing users to share their approximate rather than exact location with apps and ensuring they ask before tracking you.Having gained full trackpad and mouse support in iPad OS 13.4, Apple’s iPad software is gaining the new features from iOS 14, including customised default apps, which will make the iPad even more like a laptop computer.New for iPad OS 14 is the introduction of sidebars to most first-party apps, and the addition of toolbars similar to desktops apps with drop-down menu actions. Universal Search has been revamped to more resemble the way Spotlight search works on a Mac, with a pop up that can be invoked over any app.The new Scribble feature allows you to to turn handwriting into text in any field, and select and move handwriting in notes, using the Apple Pencil stylus and on-device machine learning.Apple’s smartwatch continues to dominate the watch market. It’s watch OS software is gaining more customisation in the form of new rich complications and new watch faces, including the new Infograph face with a tachometer and the ability to share your customised face combinations to friends and family or download them from a site or app.The Workout app has also been redesigned and renamed Fitness, which better shows your current trends on the iPhone from the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch will also be able to finally track your sleep, matching offerings from Samsung, Garmin and others. Wind Down will attempt to help you sleep by reducing distractions on your iPhone and Watch, while new alarms including silent alarms can wake you in the morning.The Apple Watch will also automatically detect hand washing, using motion and sound, and then sets a countdown timer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb1abb18c80352c6a8aa25b43b5761710c9087b/0_203_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c49acc6c8930914525d9afc6849542","title":"segway transporter production ends","story":"Company will retire Segway PT, popular with tourists and police officers, on 15 JulySegway, which boldly claimed its two-wheeled personal transporter would revolutionize the way people get around, is ending production of its namesake vehicle.The Segway PT, popular with tourists and police officers but perhaps better known for its high-profile crashes, will be retired on 15 July, the company said in a statement.“Within its first decade, the Segway PT became a staple in security and law enforcement, viewed as an effective and efficient personal vehicle,” said Judy Cai, the Segway president, in a statement, noting that in the past decade it gained popularity with vacationers in major cities in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East.The transportation revolution that inventor Dean Kamen envisioned when he founded the company in 1999 never took off. The Segway’s original price tag of around $5,000 was a hurdle for many customers. It also was challenging to ride because the rider had to be balanced at a specific angle for the vehicle to move forward. If the rider’s weight shifted too much in any direction, it could easily spin out of control and throw the rider off. They were banned in some cities because users could easily lose control if they were not balanced properly.“What did they think the market was when they built this, when they designed it?“ asked Maryann Keller, the principal at Maryann Keller \u0026amp Associates. “My impression was they were talking about this as personal mobility. How could you think that something this large and expensive would be personal mobility?”Ten months after buying the company in 2009, British self-made millionaire Jim Heselden died after the Segway he was riding careened off a 30ft cliff not far from his country estate north of London. He was 62 years old.In 2003, George W Bush avoided injury after tumbling off a Segway at his parents’ summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.A cameraman riding a Segway ran over Usain Bolt in 2015 as the Jamaican sprinter did a victory lap after winning a 200-meter race in Beijing. Bolt wasn’t injured and later joked about the incident.In 2017, Segway got into the scooter business, just as the light, inexpensive and easy-to-ride two-wheelers took over urban streets. Segway’s foray into that industry may have been a sign that its original PT’s days were numbered.“It was probably over-hyped before it was launched, and when it was launched, it was like, this is not going to work on city sidewalks,” Keller said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0069774be8e97d72e037d83b102985d577e70b2/0_356_8260_4956/master/8260.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1df44e7ab6192c250e377a87738fa507","title":"10 best books set in ireland sally rooney edan obrien colm toibin","story":"Explore Ireland’s history and culture through these tales of loss and love by Sally Rooney, Edna O’Brien, Colm Tóibín and more• Share your own suggestions in the comments belowI was born in Toronto and moved to Ireland as a boy, where I spent some formative years in a planned, Khrushchevian-style satellite town in south County Clare. Settlers arrived in waves from Belfast, London, New York or further afield – from cities throughout Chile and South Africa. In this multicultural outpost, populated by residential tourists, we became wry observers of traditional nuances. For me, Ireland’s political, historical and cultural landscapes were first properly discovered in the country’s literature. The greats, such as Wilde, Yeats and Joyce, offered signposts to the past while more contemporary writers, including Roddy Doyle, Flann O’Brien and Jamie O’Neill, shone a light on lesser-heard Irish voices. And so my selection of novels echoes Ireland’s literary journey from pre-famine to the present day.“The famine funerals, then, the women wailing, their thin screeching piercing the sky”The second novel in Walter Macken’s sweeping trilogy was published in 1962 and captures the harrowing decades in the lead up to the 1847 famine. At the start of the novel Dualta Duane’s life changes for the worse after a chance encounter with the son of a landowner. It is set in a time when Catholics still bore the scars of the last blight and eked out a bare existence working farms while paying exorbitant rents and tithes to corrupt landlords who relished a violent eviction. Dualta is the voice of these silent people. The sparkling waters of the Atlantic, stone cottages burrowed into the landscape and blue turf smoke keep his spirit alive as he journeys south along Ireland’s west coast to meet “The Liberator” Daniel O’Connell, before Black 1847 devours the county’s population.“The day was blue and brilliant, the beating sun making a mockery of the sea of dark clothes worn by the mourners”Sometimes death can make a cheerful appearance, as is the case in Deirdre Purcell’s 1993 novel about repression and isolation. With the windswept beauty of West Cork’s Beara peninsula as a backdrop, the protagonist, Elizabeth Sullivan, falls as hard for the ocean-sculpted landscape as she does for the young dancer – Daniel McCarthy. Despite a loveless marriage and unwanted pregnancy in 1930s Ireland – when most unmarried mothers were shipped to the Magdalene Laundries – happiness is discovered in the mucky paddocks beneath the shadow of a mountain. The novel was written shortly before we got to see the full horror the high walls of the Magdalene Laundries and Industrial Schools had been hiding.“The rain drove us into the church – our refuge, our strength, our only dry place”Limerick’s Georgian avenues and compact medieval quarter have finally emerged from the cloudy streetscape of Frank McCourt’s poverty stricken 1930s childhood to become a vibrant destination. This moving memoir and tribute to his mother, Angela, published in 1996, laid bare his bid for survival in tenement conditions on the fringes of Limerick’s society, and earned him a Pulitzer prize. Unknown to the young McCourt, across town future Hollywood legend Richard Harris and Terry Wogan were growing up in different circumstances, without the rainy-day backstory of death, near starvation and destitution. Head to O’Connell Avenue to South’s Bar and see where Frank’s father drank away their family’s meagre earnings.“At the far edge of the lake there was a belt of poplar trees, shutting out the world”The ground-breaking 1960 novel by County Clare author Edna O’Brien gave a voice to Irish women’s liberation, and the ensuing parochial outrage and censorship on its publication guaranteed its enduring success. This first book in the trilogy traces the lives of young Cait Brady and Baba Brennan, from their drab, cloistered life in County Limerick to the bright lights of Dublin. Scaling the pages were older men, like the predatory Mister Gentleman, who used the country girls’ bid for emancipation to exploit their vulnerability. The book incensed the country’s power houses at the time – church and state – who struggled to grasp the concept that women may want more from life than domestic servitude.“There was a vague mist that masked the line between the horizon and the sky”Colm Tóibin’s Costa Award-winning novel, published in 2009, is the story of the immigrant, transformed by the loneliness and freedom of her journey. Eilis Lacey returns home to Ireland in the 1950s and her married life in New York becomes obscured in a haze across the ocean. She adapts to the old familiar pace of life in County Wexford and begins to see handsome Jim Farrell with fresh eyes. However, Brooklyn eventually finds her in the cosy Irish coastal cocoon and she has to make a difficult choice between her two different worlds.“It was getting dark now, though the afterglow lingered over the western Atlantic a sky too big for the sun to leave”Man Booker prize-winner Anne Enright sets her softly lyrical novel at the tail end of Ireland’s Celtic Tiger economy. Rosaleen Madigan is entering her twilight years at her homestead by an old famine (green) road on the Burren Park’s ocean-ridged limestone landscape in County Clare. Rosaleen’s four children return to spend one last Christmas together, and the intricate backstories of their scarred lives unfold in the first half of this 2015 novel. Hanna is an alcoholic in Dublin, Dan is living with his boyfriend in Toronto, Emmet drifts through Mali and Constance stays close to home. Personalities clash over Christmas, before Rosaleen wanders into the darkness to escape the drama.“The colour of the streets always seemed drained and muted as if the colours, too, had been blown away”Two tales of the same city sharply conveyed by unlikely working-class friends: one a toughly veneered Catholic, the other a capitalist Protestant. The Belfast setting for this novel, published in 1996, straddles the months before and after the 1994 IRA ceasefire. The often-humorous take on the slowly retreating shadow of the troubles graphically depicts the violence of a fractured Belfast, as the protagonists try to normalise their lives in the chaos and prejudice. One chapter lulls the reader into a soft, harmonious take on the city and it’s followed by another, which blows apart the setting with the bombing of a sandwich shop. The two friends’ tangled lives are told in fast-paced prose and peppered with satire, a foreshadowing of the author’s future role at Charlie Hebdo.“Things you were sure you’d have in the future turn out to be on the far side of a big, dark mountain”Donal Ryan spins a Booker-prize longlisted yarn set in the lush Tipperary countryside, a place where looming hillsides and wide lakes block escape paths to mental and physical liberty. Mourning mother Bridie sits with her back to the River Shannon to block neighbouring County Clare where her child died, while Vasya concedes that he will drown if he tries to swim across Lough Derg. They are just two of 21 desolate voices marooned by circumstance in his novel, published in 2012. It’s set at a time when Ireland was haunted by ghost estates and zombie hotels as reckless bank lending destroyed the Irish economy and normal people were left to rebuild lives from the carnage.“Dublin is extraordinarily beautiful to her in wet weather, the way grey stone darkens to black”Published in 2018 and longlisted for a Booker prize in the same year, Sally Rooney’s tale of fractured hearts and minds crosses class structure and Ireland from the west coast to Dublin – and appeared on Barack Obama’s top 19 book list for 2019. It traces the fragile relationship between a popular high-school student, Connell, and marginalised Marianne, through their reversal of fortunes when she becomes Dublin’s Trinity College cool girl and he loses his way in the bigness of life there. The book’s small-screen production dominated ratings and press coverage throughout the Covid-19 lockdown, as did Connell’s short shorts, necklace and prolonged nudity. Onscreen, Tobercurry and Streedagh Strand in Sligo played the novel’s fictional town of Carricklea.“Henceforth I would have to address things as they are, not as I might imagine them, for this was a new version of reality”John Banville’s 2005 Man Booker prize-winning novel depicts art historian, Max Morden, as a man all at sea, trying to navigate his way through the turbulence of loss and sorrow. He returns to County Wexford, where he spent summer holidays as a child. You can almost taste the salty air and feel the gentle breeze burn tender skin as the prose ebbs and flows between the past and the present, in this timeless, meditative, disquieting masterpiece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf71a3f9cbdb523babcbf5cc8a475bd4522914f/47_0_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e52d1d562529f713950733f6fbc92cd","title":"return to camping the quiet site lake district","story":"Confirmation that campsites can open on 4 July has prompted a rush of bookings. For one award-winning eco holiday park in the Lake District, the phone hasn’t stopped ringing...‘The phone started ringing even before he’d finished talking,” says Daniel Holder, referring to Tuesday’s announcement by Boris Johnson that campsites and hotels are allowed to reopen on 4 July. Four of the 12 people employed by Holder, managing director of The Quiet Site, an ultra-green holiday park in Ullswater, Cumbria, were poised to speak to people eager to book a stay at the site. At the same time, Holder was replying as fast as possible to a flood of emails. “We had 206 in the first hour.”It doesn’t surprise me that people are so keen to visit. The Quiet Site is an exceptional place. In April it became the first holiday park in the country to win a Queen’s Award for Enterprise. And the campsite’s post-lockdown credentials are impeccable. With its Hobbit Holes, pods and generously-sized pitches spread out over the large site, social distancing should be easy. Its location on a rural hillside also means visitors are far from the pell-mell of urban life of any sort. And if the enforced isolation has left you starved of soul-easing views, you won’t even have to leave your tent to drink them in. I stayed there last autumn and even though my visit coincided with rather iffy weather, I still had a cracking time.The Quiet Site is high above Ullswater, sheltered by the perfect dome of Little Mell Fell. As well as pitches for tents and campervans, it also has pods (designed by Kendal’s Ian Bone, whose classic “upturned boat” shape you see in many places now), and 15 partially subterranean mega-pods that are as snug as their name suggests.Not one to do things by halves, Holder’s installation of solar panels, extreme insulation and a biomass boiler fired by locally-sourced woodchips has made the site not merely carbon neutral but carbon positive. But if you’re thinking “hairshirt”, think again. My Hobbit Hole came with thermostat-controlled underfloor heating beneath its stone flags. There’s also a microwave, fridge, kettle and a spacious loo.“We want it to be a progressive opening. It wouldn’t be right for our staff or locals if we were full immediately but we will start slowly and build on it as and when we can,” says Holder.When I arrived last year, I did so on a pleasant mostly back-lane cycle from Penrith station. Once I’d settled in and put the kettle on, I sat outside in one of the old school deckchairs, sheltered beneath my new dwelling’s ample awning, and gazed idly out. Beyond a billowing tent and a thicket of trees I spied silvery fragments of Ullswater beneath the broad green brushstroke of Barton Fell. From somewhere behind me, a rook rattled out a throaty cheer.The next day it rained. Undaunted, I ventured out along a section of the Ullswater Way, a 20-mile waymarked footpath. My four-mile walk from the campsite – over the exposed Gowbarrow Fell and down to the waterfalls of Aira Force – was somewhat damp, but the rain did at least ensure that the waterfalls plunged with enough drama to justify the sousing.Helvellyn, that mighty warrior among Cumbrian fells, had burrowed itself away into the clouds and the gusting winds were so ferocious that the Ullswater steamers that ply the mere had been cancelled. I was thankful for a cosy dinner at the award-winning Another Place, a lakeside hotel and restaurant in nearby Watermillock, where I wolfed down a warming coconut katsu with tofu.The next day, armed with a map of the 1618-hectare Lowther estate’s cycle trails, which opened in 2019, I took my electric bicycle to a castle bathed in sunshine.“We’ll have a whip around Askham Fell and take in a couple of neolithic burial chambers and a stone circle.”It’s the kind of sentence I like to hear: full of outdoorsy, nosing-about-in-history promise. It was spoken by Alex, a whip-thin bicycle tour guide. I couldn’t help feeling it was cheating – the fact I’d hired an electric mountain bike for the day – but it did rather take the sting out of the Lake District’s vertiginous inclines. It also meant I could take advantage of the maze of stony, grassy and, at times, gloriously boggy bridleways on the fells and a new network of waymarked cycle trails on the Lowther Castle estate.The greater part of the 1st Earl of Lonsdale’s grand Georgian mansion is a shell. It is the magnificent 52-hectare gardens that are the castle’s glory. At lunch, I headed for Askham Hall’s Kitchen Garden Cafe, a five-minute woodland ride away. I had a tasty artichoke, olive and homemade-pesto pizza from an outdoor wood-fired oven and then wandered about Lowther’s modern parterre – created by rockstar garden designer Dan Pearson.Back at base, I had breakfast served to me by The Quiet Site’s Spicy Sausage food van and dropped in at the excellent on-site zero-waste shop. There I borrowed some washed-up containers and filled them with popping corn and sugar in preparation for a late-night treat, adding rather healthier muesli for the morning. Since my stay the van has gone but the zero-waste shop has been open for locals throughout lockdown.Undoubtedly the most surprising thing about The Quiet Site is its bar. Yes, I know: campsite bars are where dreams go to die. As I entered The Quiet Bar, my expectation meter was showing high levels of trepidation. What I found was a traditional 17th-century Cumbrian Long Barn converted in the 1960s and lit by fairy lights wrapped around beams, making it positively murky … but in a good way. A couple of rustic wooden galleries were filled with extra settees and old church pews. They were needed, too: despite it being a damp Tuesday night the bar was buzzing. Happily, it reopens on 4 July – it will be seating only and table service but the beer will be just as good.I sampled a draught Ullswater Blonde, the local Tirril brewery’s very more-ish pale best bitter, and watched that night’s billed entertainment: a very young man in black tie shimmying from table to table doing polished little magic tricks as if we were in Vegas. To top it off, the bar staff had a simple but brilliant music policy: if David Bowie didn’t sing it, they didn’t play it.

His press secretary later said the remarks were “in jest” but the president stood by them on Tuesday, telling reporters that the comments weren’t a joke.Speaking to the congressional committee hours later, however, Fauci said: “I know for sure that to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.”Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, spoke to the committee alongside Redfield the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn and a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services, Brett Giroir.Fauci last testified before Congress in May, when states were still mostly shut down. Since then staggered reopenings have taken place across the country, and several states are seeing a concerning increase in cases.He said the state of coronavirus in the US was overall a “mixed bag”, in part because of the country’s huge size and ersity.He said some areas, such as New York City, had done well to rein in cases by following the government’s guidelines for reopening, but said the “disturbing surge” in infections in other parts of the country was very concerning.“The next couple of weeks are going to be critical to address those surges we’re seeing,” Fauci said, specifically citing the increase in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas.The concerns shared by top health leaders at the hearing contradicted Trump’s continued efforts to downplay the effects of Covid-19.At least eight Trump campaign staffers tested positive for Covid-19 in Tulsa, where Trump told a campaign rally that he had asked administration officials to slow down testing, because too many positive cases are turning up.After administration figures including White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany suggested the comments weren’t serious or were a joke, Trump on Tuesday said: “I never kid.”“Testing is a double-edged sword,” Trump told reporters. “One way, it shows you have cases and in another way you find out where the cases are and you do a good job.”When asked inidually at the congressional hearing if the president had asked the US health leaders to slow down testing, they all responded “no”.At the time of the May hearing, Fauci was one of many speakers to testify from a video feed at home. This time, the speakers were in person for this hearing.In the chamber, the men sat with tubs of disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer pumps next to their nameplates. While committee members and speakers are usually packed tight, people sat at a distance, wearings masks, which they removed to speak.Fauci told the committee he was “cautiously optimistic” that a vaccine would be ready at the end of the year or early 2021. The group also expressed concern about what could happen if coronavirus cases were still high when flu season arrives in the autumn.In a prepared statement, the experts said such a collision could again burden the country’s healthcare system.“If there is Covid-19 and flu activity at the same time, this could place a tremendous burden on the healthcare system related to bed occupancy, laboratory testing needs, personal protective equipment and healthcare worker safety,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ed433391d3489f33e6539028f7be0e5744007bd/252_334_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e89eedd48495f19746f1503ba926a294","title":"big tobacco wants our youths lungs rise of smoking in jordan","story":"Despite one of the world’s highest smoking rates, many politicians believe a ban will affect the economyby  Michael Safi and Jassar Al-Tahat in AmmanWhen patients quit cigarettes at the King Hussein Cancer Center’s smoking clinic they are asked to be patient with their children. Often their offspring have been exposed to so much secondhand smoke that they have become addicted, too.“For every four cigarettes their parent has smoked, the child has smoked one,” says Firas al-Hawari, a physician who directs the clinic. “We can control the parents with medication, but the kids are going through withdrawals because we don’t have them on medication.”Figures published by the  on Tuesday show that the Middle Eastern kingdom of Jordan has surpassed Indonesia to have the highest smoking rates in the world. Including e-cigarettes and other “smokeless” products, more than eight in 10 Jordanian men are nicotine users, according to a 2019 national survey carried out in collaboration with the World Health Organization.Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found. “In Jordan we consider someone who smokes a pack a day to be a light smoker,” Hawari says. “We have people who smoke three, five, seven packs a day. It is like it was in the 1950s or 1960s in other places.”The proliferation of tobacco is obvious on a summer night in the country’s capital, Amman. Thick smoke wafts from water pipes and cigarettes in the courtyards of cafes and restaurants that have recently emerged from the country’s stringent coronavirus lockdown. Officials nonchalantly smoke in government offices, many of which are fitted with no-smoking signs. Even hospitals struggle to enforce bans in a country where more than a third of doctors are smokers, according to a 2013 survey.Jordanians with conditions such as asthma can end up planning their lives around avoiding smoke. “They smoked all the time: at their desks, in the hallways, in the bathroom,” says Ruba Madhadha of her colleagues at the government agency where she worked. “I used to run away to my car to do emails, just to keep doing my job.”For a few months she used steroid inhalers to manage her condition, but she finally had to leave the office in January. Smoking was officially banned in the building, she says. “But nobody does anything – no fines, no punishment.”The impacts of so much smoking are already stark: tobacco use is linked to one in eight deaths in the country, compared with one in 10 deaths worldwide, and costs Jordan’s GDP an estimated three times the global average.But Hawari say the true scale of the problem will be known in about 2030, when a bulk of the country’s disproportionately young population reaches 40 – the age at which tobacco-related illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, start to manifest. “It’s going to cause an enormous surge in non-communicable diseases that we won’t be able to handle,” he says.Surveys show tobacco use is still growing, on the back of a rise in women taking up the habit and the popularity of water pipes, which doctors say can be equivalent to consuming approximately three packs of cigarettes over a 45-minute session.The emergence of e-cigarettes, marketed as a tool to help people stop smoking, have so far led to more people using nicotine overall than quitting cigarettes, according to the 2019 nationalWHO statistics.Smoking used to be endemic in wealthier countries such as the US, Australia and many in Europe. But decades of aggressive public health campaigns and restrictions on the ability of tobacco companies to advertise and lobby have succeeded in dramatically cutting their smoking rates.Many of those corporate tactics have now migrated to countries in the Middle East and Africa, where regulations are more lax and poorly enforced, suggests Raouf Alebshehy, a monitoring coordinator in the tobacco control research group at the University of Bath. The majority of the world’s smokers now live in middle- and lower-income countries.Analysts suspect smoking rates may be just as high in countries such as Iraq, Lebanon and Syria – Jordan is just advanced and stable enough to be able to measure its problem.“What makes the Middle East region special in terms of its smoking rates?” Alebshehy says. “It isn’t lack of information. It’s a closed case that tobacco is harmful. One of the important factors we have found in this region is that the multinational companies started to invest and expand here. They started to shift work from developed markets to emerging markets here and in Africa where tobacco demand is still growing, and they bought up local manufacturers.”Jordan has the most tobacco company interference in policymaking in the world after Japan, according to a 2019 analysis by a civil society group. “Big tobacco is preying on our countries, wanting to really own the lungs of our youth,” says Princess Dina Mired, the president of the Union for International Cancer Control and a member of the country’s royal family. “And they are doing so successfully.”Many in government do not see a problem. Smoking is not even banned in the Jordanian parliament. When lawmakers tried to do so in 2004, a report in the Jordan Times says they had to reverse the decision as meetings started losing quorum because too many MPs were outside have a cigarette.“Members of parliament tell me: ‘This is an economic matter, you are affecting the Jordanian economy and threatening the jobs of people working in the industry’,” says Mervat Mheerat, the deputy manager for health in Greater Amman Municipality. “They correlate tobacco with the economy. And that’s the message they get from the tobacco industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2b8a00fc252c05d3f129138cd8b84a3f74f191b/0_48_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=380628ca36d9f16fc1d354ab33a68288","title":"easing several lockdown rules at once could boost virus say uk scientists","story":"Sage advisers warn of risks of halving 2-metre rule while reopening venues in England The easing of multiple lockdown measures in England at once risks Covid-19 gaining a fresh foothold, scientists advising the government have warned.They raised concerns over the halving of the 2-metre physical distancing rule at the same time as reopening venues, saying the country was currently experiencing up to 4,300 Covid-19 infections a day and had no effective digital track-and-trace system, while highlighting research that showed transmission of the virus was more likely to happen indoors.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.On Monday, it was announced that millions of people with underlying health issues would be permitted to leave their homes and mix with groups from 6 July, for the first time in three months.On Tuesday Boris Johnson gave venues from museums to pubs to hairdressers the green light to reopen from 4 July, halved physical distancing from 2 metres to 1 metre and said two households could meet up indoors, both also from 4 July.Acknowledging the relief many would feel – the  headline on Tuesday was “Freedom pass for millions” – Johnson called it the end of a “long national hibernation”. However, scientists made clear that it came with risk.Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said: “The social distancing rules that have been in place since March have had two effects: first, the number of contacts that we make has been drastically reduced and second the nature of these contacts has also become safer, as we seldom meet inside and we have been maintaining 2 metres of distance wherever possible.“Relaxing the 2-metre rule at the same time as opening bars and restaurants does run the risk of allowing the epidemic to start to regain a foothold. These changes will have to be very carefully monitored and the NHS track-and-trace system will have to be working properly to help keep us safe.”She said that while the government was entitled to make a political decision – as Downing Street has indicated it has – it was important to be fully transparent, so the public could fully understand the risks and see whose advice it was relying on.Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, published on Tuesday, showed that the latest weekly number of deaths from Covid-19 in England and Wales was 1,114, the lowest since 27 March, shortly after the imposition of the full lockdown on 23 March. On Monday, the official tally of UK deaths from Covid-19 was 15, the lowest number since 15 March.The latest ONS infection statistics show that approximately one in 1,700 people in a community setting in England (not in a hospital, care home or similar) had Covid-19 at any given time between 31 May and 13 June. This compares with one in 400 between 3 May and 16 May.But there have been concerns that the R value, showing the transmission rate, has been rising and is close to – or even above (different studies vary) – 1 in certain regions, which could lead to an exponential increase in cases.Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh and not affiliated to Sage, said: “If the current R – bearing in mind there is a lag – is about 1, and the pre-lockdown R was around 3 to 4, then the difference, of about 2 to 3, is made up by things that we aren’t doing that we were doing before (at least so long as the number of people who are immune is relatively few).“As we move through the gears of releasing lockdown we will ‘recover’ some of those missing events. The important thing is that we do so in a way that the change isn’t too sudden. Of course things like face masks will likely help to keep it down – but we don’t yet know how much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"Lockdown restrictions are to be eased from 6 July and we want to hear how you feel about itFrom 6 July, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

It says: “It sometimes seems as if there are two cities in London: one sacred, one secular. Certainly, there is considerable value ergence.”In a foreword to the report, Elizabeth Oldfield, director of Theos, writes: “London is, wonderfully, a global city, and can justifiably claim to be one of the most erse in the world. We shouldn’t be surprised, then, by the findings of the Religious London project (though I suspect many will be).“We think of London not only as a cultural, political and economic hub, but also as England’s liberal heartland. In such a erse city, however, no single story is the whole story.

The rate of new infections has fallen in recent weeks and cities including Moscow have lifted anti-virus lockdowns, but critics accuse Putin of rushing ahead with public events to pursue his own political ends.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 587 to 191,449, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday.The reported death toll rose by 19 to 8,914, the tally showed.More from New Zealand with Charlotte Graham-McLay:Ever since a major blunder in government-managed quarantine more than a week ago, in which two women with Covid-19 were allowed to leave facilities without being tested, New Zealand’s top health official has been under pressure to reveal the number of returning travelers who departed their isolation hotels without taking tests.But today, Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director-general of health, told reporters that he now had the figures. Of 54 returning travellers who were allowed to leave managed quarantine early – it is supposed to be 14 days in length – on compassionate grounds, only two were tested for the coronavirus before they left their isolation hotels. Two others were tested on the day they left.Most of the others have since tested negative.The compassionate exemption to quarantine was revoked after two British travelers were allowed to leave without taking a test, and were later diagnosed with the virus. Of the 2,159 other people who had left quarantine before 16 June – when quarantine testing rules tightened up – only 800 were tested for Covid-19, Bloomfield said. 210 had been tested after departure. All had tested negative. Those people had all completed their 14-day isolation period after returning from abroad, he added – at which point the risk of transmission of the virus is thought to be low. However, he has been questioned daily by reporters about his inability to produce the figures.  asked the country’s Ministry of Health last Tuesday how many people had left isolation without a test, with no response. Returning travellers in quarantine are now required to take two Covid-19 tests before they leave, or they are not allowed out for a further 14 days. Charlotte Graham-McLay with the latest from New Zealand:New Zealand has recorded one new case of Covid-19, diagnosed in a traveler returning from abroad who remains in government-run isolation facilities.That means the country has reported 11 active cases of Covid-19, all in people returning to New Zealand. Nine of them were diagnosed during their government-managed isolation and remain there. The other two, travellers returning from Britain, were mistakenly allowed out of government-run quarantine without a test to visit a dying relative, and were later confirmed to have the virus. Since the women’s cases emerged last week, more than 45,000 Covid-19 tests have been taken among New Zealand’s population of 5m people, to try to rule out widespread community transmission. Health officials, giving a news conference in Wellington, said 9,174 tests were taken yesterday alone – the most of any day of the coronavirus outbreak. The latest case was diagnosed in a woman aged in her 60s who arrived in New Zealand on 18 June. She was traveling on a repatriation flight from India, according to health officials, who are giving a news conference in Wellington.The new cases have been uncovered over the past week, after New Zealand had recorded a full week with no active cases of the coronavirus, and 24 consecutive days of no new diagnosed instances. But officials had warned that the number would tick up again as New Zealanders returned from Covid-19 hotspots around the world. New Zealanders and their families, along with some essential workers, are the only people permitted to enter the country.They must remain in isolation at government-run hotels for 14 days, and take two tests for Covid-19. Iowa regulators say they found no workplace safety violations at Tyson Foods’ largest pork processing plant, which employed several people who died after contracting the coronavirus, AP reports. The Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration closed its inquiry into the Tyson plant in Waterloo earlier this month without sanctioning the meat company.County officials and workers have alleged that in March and part of April workers did not have adequate personal protective equipment to stop the spread of the virus and were not social distancing. The company says it has taken numerous safety steps since then, including requiring masks, screening for symptoms, and frequent testing.Black Hawk County has said that more than 1,000 of the Waterloo plant’s 2,800 workers had tested positive for the virus or antibodies by early May.The Associated Press has confirmed that at least five workers have died after getting the virus, most recently a 44-year-old maintenance worker who died on Memorial Day after a lengthy illness. The other deaths have included a 65-year-old laundry department worker, a 58-year-old Bosnian refugee, a 60-year-old Latino father and a refugee from Congo.Iowa health officials have not released the number of meatpacking workers who have died because of the virus in Waterloo or at other plants.Meanwhile in New Zealand, a growing number of social media users are trespassing on private property at a beach west of Auckland to frolic in natural “infinity pools” on a cliff top – some in the nude – and driving the owners to despair.Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the :“We’ve absolutely had enough,” said Buzz Kronfeld, part of a family who owns three plots of land at Anawhata Beach, 50km from New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland.Finding the “secret” pools at Anawhata Beach, has become a piece of online lore directions are listed on tourist sites and Instagrammers who visit call it a “hidden gem” or “Auckland’s best kept secret”.“Def worth a trespass,” one woman on Instagram captioned her picture. “One of the nicer places I have urinated,” wrote a young man, below a photo of himself relaxing in one of the pools.During summer, Kronfeld said, visitors number 30 to 40 a day. “I kicked 23 people out of the pools once,” he said, adding that some were angry when asked to leave, and on a couple of occasions, his relatives had almost come to blows with trespassers.Newsroom, a New Zealand media outlet, recently set up a hidden camera by the pools to film those trespassing on Kronfeld’s property. As well as capturing dozens of topless – and occasionally bottomless – young people posing in the pools, and even couples having sex, the covert filming caught tourists visiting during New Zealand’s strict coronavirus lockdown. At that time, travelling further than one’s neighbourhood was banned.The discovery of new cancer treatments could be delayed, research institutes shut, and a whole generation of upcoming scientists lost because of a funding crisis in medical research, UK charities have warned.Covid-19 has caused fundraising to plummet, with events cancelled and charity shops shut because of the lockdown. The upshot is a dire financial situation that could have a severe impact on research crucial to finding new ways to diagnose, manage and treat diseases from cancer to neurological conditions and heart disease.“The current pandemic has put the future of charity-funded research at significant risk,” said Aisling Burnand, chief executive of the Association of Medical Research Charities (AMRC).The full story on the situation in Victoria, Australia now: Australia has recorded its first Covid-19 death in one month, with Victoria’s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, announcing that a man in his 80s died overnight, bringing the country’s total death toll to 103.It came as Victoria grappled with a spike in cases in the past week, reporting double-digit rises in new cases every day for more than one week. Twenty new cases of the virus were announced by Sutton on Wednesday. The new cases include three staff members who tested positive at Hampstead dental clinic in Maidstone, 8km north-west from Melbourne city. There are now 241 cases that have been identified since the epidemic began in Victoria that indicate community transmission, an increase of eight since yesterday.A person has died in the state of Victoria, Australia, in the first coronavirus-related death in more than a month. The man in his 80s died overnight. Australia’s total death toll from the virus now stands at 103.

Photograph: Google Street ViewA cafe located behind Dublin’s Four Courts has been operating a sit-in service for almost three weeks ahead of the permitted reopening of cafes and restaurants next week.Fegan’s 1924 Cafe on Chancery Street, 200m from Bridewell Garda station, is allowing customers to use its indoor tables, despite the cafe and restaurant sector being restricted to operating take-away services until June 29th under coronavirus regulations.Cafe owner James Fegan said he was providing a service particularly for barristers who would have “nowhere else to go” if the cafe was not available to them. He said gardaí had also been using the cafe’s toilets when it was not practical for them to return to the Garda station.Mr Fegan said he had operated a take-away service for approximately six weeks but was now in his third week of providing an indoor service, in line with 2m distancing of tables and a strict hygiene and cleaning regime.“About 85 per cent of our business comes out of the Four Courts. We would get a lot of legal eagles in here, people giving advice to clients. They haven’t got the space in the courts and we would be the closest place for them to use a table. The likes of barristers would have nowhere else to go.”Mr Fegan said he was only allowing regular customers to sit in, with those he did not know being restricted to take away only.“During the Gemma O’Doherty and John Waters case there were some protesters who wanted to come in, but we didn’t allow that. I have no problem with protesters but we didn’t know them. But we did have guards in using the toilet at that time.”Mr Fegan said his business differed from a standard cafe or restaurant in that it was part of a cash and carry.“The cash and carry and wholesale business has continued all the way through, so given we were here anyway we thought we might as well keep the cafe business going.”Health and safetyThe cafe is “fully sanitised” at the start of every morning and before and after lunch, while the tables and chairs are cleaned after every sitting, Mr Fegan said. Staff had undergone health and safety training, including training on how to reassure customers who might be nervous to return to cafes.As he had opened ahead of the official date of June 29th, he had been asked to advise other cafes and restaurants ahead of their reopening next week. Mr Fegan said he had not been asked by the Garda or any other authority to stop serving customers indoors.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Friends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transition"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Guinness has announced a new €14m fund to help Irish pubs. File photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Guinness has launched a €14 million fund to help Irish pubs preparing to reopen following the easing of coronavirus restrictions.The “Raising the Bar” programme is aimed at helping pubs across the State adapt to new post-lockdown trading conditions as part of a $100 million (€88.4 million) global fund by owner Diageo. Although self-motivated – Guinness is a staple of Irish bars the world over – the move will be welcomed by a sector that has been among the hardest hit in an era of strict social distancing. Here, it will focus on the provision of practical equipment and “confidence-building measures needed for outlets to reopen and operate on a safe and sustainable basis”.Job lossesThe State’s 7,000 pubs were first asked to shut their doors in mid-March amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a move that left about 50,000 people out of work overnight. At the time, one industry representative described it as the “biggest loss of jobs in the history of the State”. Oliver Loomes, managing director of Diageo Ireland, said the company’s ambition is to support pubs “in welcoming back customers in the safest possible way, when they are ready to do so”.“The hospitality sector in Ireland requires long-term investment and support to get back up and running. Not only has the financial impact to their business been significant, but they have missed their place at the centre of Ireland’s social fabric,” he said. “This fund is our commitment to the future of the local pub in Ireland.”However, Diageo has also underscored the need for other forms of support. Chief executive Ivan Menezes said governments around the world need to provide “long-term recovery packages” for the hospitality sector. Clear damageThe damage caused by Covid-19 to the hospitality industry is clear. Some 24 million fewer pints of beer and cider were sold in the Republic in April compared with the same month last year, while total alcohol sales fell 35.6 per cent, according to data released by lobby group Drinks Ireland. While pubs are now preparing to welcome customers back, the atmosphere and operation will be far from familiar. This month chief medical officer Tony Holohan warned that a resumption in trade would not mean several people meeting up “for a few pints and having a packet of peanuts”.Under recently published guidance, pubs and bars will be allowed to implement 1m physical distancing restrictions from June 29th in “permitted controlled environments”, but will be required to serve a “substantial meal” costing at least €9 to customers.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4286747.1592952011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considers review of offences against the state act","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to sources,   Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan may announce a review of the controversial legislation. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThe Government is understood to be considering a review of the Offences Against the State Act, the legislation that has been used in trials of subversives and gangland crimes for the past five decades.The Act provides for the establishment of the non-jury Special Criminal Court and, because it is emergency legislation, it has to be renewed each year.The renewal date is June 30th but without a functioning Seanad at present, it will mean the legitimacy of the court will expire at the end of the month unless a new government is formed.That has prompted concerns of trials against suspects not being able to proceed because the legislative basis behind the charges no longer exists.Sources said last night that Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan may be minded to announce a review of the legislation which has been controversial.However, it is understood the review will not be a stand-alone review but be part of a comprehensive reevaluation of security legislation recommended by the Commision on the Future of Policing in Ireland.While Mr Flanagan is said not be opposed to the idea of a review, there are no indications that Fine Gael - or, for that matter, Fianna Fáil - would agree to the ending the non-jury status of the court.Until recent years it was primarily used to prosecute so-called scheduled offences including subversive crimes and membership of illegal organisations such as the IRA, the INLA, and the Real IRA.In recent years it has also been used for non-scheduled offences in drugs and gangland cases, where there are concerns over intimidation of, and threats against, juries.The Dáil will debate a motion on the legislation on Wednesday in anticipation of a government being formed. If it is, the incoming government will work to get the legislation through the Dáil at the special sitting on Saturday and through the newly convened Seanad on Monday. That will allow it to be renewed before the Act lapses.Calls to abolishSinn Féin has been calling for the court to be abolished for more than two decades primarily because it was used as a vehicle to prosecute IRA members. Its objections focus nowadays on the fact that it is a non-jury court.Official Green Party policy has also been for the court to be abolished. However, both its leader Eamon Ryan and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald signalled they would be willing to change their respective parties’ stances on the legislation during the general election campaign in February.That came after the particularly brutal murder of Drogheda teenager Keane Mulready-Woods as part of a wider feud involving drug guns.Sinn Féin now says it accepts special powers are needed to tackle gangland crime but still objects to the non-jury nature of the court. It has consistently voted against the renewal of the powers.In an amendment tabled by its justice spokesman, Martin Kenny, the party says it is willing to accept a court with special powers as its priority is to tackle organised crime.“To do this we need to put in place a law that befits the 21st century. Criminal gangs operate on a global scale and some operate entirely online,” said Mr Kenny.He said new legislation should be enacted to put the court on a permanent basis. It was ridiculous that emergency powers intended as a temporary measure were still being used almost 48 years after their enactment, he said.Remote juriesHowever, he said the party did not accept that a non-jury court was the way to proceed. He argued that the advent of technology would allow remote juries, whose anonymity could be protected. This could help prevent jury tampering and intimidation, which occurred in some gangland and drug cases which were heard before juries in the ordinary criminal courts.The Greens have also called for a review of the courts.Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael have raised any objection to the non-jury nature of the court.However, if Mr Flanagan does agree to an independent review – while leaving the emergency powers in place for another year – there is a possibility that Sinn Féin might not oppose the renewal for the first time since its TDs entered Dáil Éireann in 1997."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4286827.1592950767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says country needs majority government for difficult times ahead","story":"Taoiseach Leo Vardkar said the country “needs a majority government” as it faces into a what could be a very difficult recession. In what was billed as his probable last broadcast interview in office on RTE’s Prime Time programme , he was drawn on the ongoing efforts to form a three way government with Fianna Fail and the Green Party but stuck to familiar lines ahead of Friday’s critical vote among party members. However, he said he was not enthused by the prospect of being voted back in as Taoiseach for a single day in order to appoint the necessary number of Senators required to renew criminal justice laws underpinning the Special Criminal Court which are due to lapse. “I am not ruling it out but I have no desire to pursue it,” he said, instead reinforcing his stated desire for a strong majority government. He said it was “not a good option” but it was important the Offences Against the State Act was renewed. Mr Varadkar said he would meet Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald but only to explore the reasons why Fine Gael could not enter into coalition with her party.As members of the Green Party grapple with whether or not to support the proposed government, Mr Varadkar said he would also remain faithful to his party’s commitment to a 7 per cent annual reduction in carbon emissions even in the event the Greens vote to enter opposition. On Tuesday , a report by the Taskforce for Aviation Recovery called on the Government to lift quarantine rules on incoming passengers by next week. The Taoiseach urged caution but said he had not yet seen the report. Any such easing of air travel, he explained, must be done carefully and along air bridges with specific countries to avoid the risk of “reimporting” virus cases. NursesMr Varadkar also disputed claims made by the head of the Irish nurses’ representative body about Covid sickness among healthcare workers as inaccurate. On Tuesday, the Oireachtas Covid-19 Committee was told that Irish healthcare workers had the highest global rate of infection. Phil Ní Sheaghdha, general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO), said the figures amounted to “an absolute scandal”. Statistics presented to the committee claimed that up to the end of May, a total of 8,018 cases of infection of healthcare workers were reported. Of those, 66 per cent or 4,823 remain out sick, and of that number 1,600 are categorised as nurses and midwives.However Mr Varadkar said he checked the information given by Ms Ní Sheaghdha with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). “And they say that we have had 8,000 positive cases out of a healthcare workforce of 250,000 so that’s between a 3 and 4 per cent positivity rate. So they are saying that that was wrong.” Mr Varadkar added, however, that 8,000 healthcare workers did contract the virus and there was a need to ensure those working in the sector are protected. TracingAs regards the possible spread of Covid-19 in Ireland following a relaxation of restrictions, the Taoiseach said localised outbreaks were likely and that in such circumstances localised lockdowns would be required, but that these could then be controlled with robust contact tracing systems. A recent outbreak at a German meat processing plant triggered a return to lockdown conditions in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.Mr Varadkar said he was confident Irish people would understand any similar necessity here “if it’s necessary to contain a virus in a particular place or a particular area”. Mean GirlsOn a more trivial note, Mr Varadkar dismissed a line of questioning on his decision to quote the teen movie Mean Girls when recently addressing the issue of further lockdown easing. He appeared to have referenced the 2004 movie as in-joke with actor Sean Aston who said in a recent radio interview that he would bet him €50 he could not do so. Asked whether this was appropriate, or a distraction on a serious issue, he said any quote was appropriate if the context was appropriate. “I think it is a distraction for some people but not for me,” he said.

Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The Briefing, The \u0026#39s two-minute audio updatesNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

At the time, there had been 350 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. Today there have been close to 40,000. That grim figure explains why the Government has retained the controls over social interactions, albeit with modifications as the pace of contagion has slowed.Now that it has almost halted, Mr Johnson is emboldened to relax the restrictions further and, in delivering better news, he certainly looked far more chipper in the Commons than he has done for a while, back to the old Boris.But listening to his statement about what we are now permitted to do was to appreciate in the starkest terms what it is that we have lost. For a country that is defined by its love of freedom to be told that we can go to the pub, though only if we supply our names and addresses to the innkeeper or can get our hair cut, though only if our coiffeur dresses like a nuclear power plant worker or we can have a dinner party but must not embrace or kiss our guests, these are hard orders to take, even if they are dressed up as “guidance”. As a law-abiding nation, we take these things seriously even when they are not actually the law of the land as many of these “rules” are not, including the two-metre distancing.Many restrictions seem arbitrary. Why, for instance, is professional football allowed but not cricket? This makes no sense since the former involves much more close contact. Mr Johnson said the ball in cricket acted as a vector for disease but on that basis the game will never restart.We were promised Independence Day on July 4 but remain in chains, even if they are looser than before. Even when we are freed, which will not happen this year because of the Government’s fear of a second wave, much will have changed.Looking through my wallet yesterday was like a Proustian journey into a past life. Photo-passes to offices \u2028I no longer visit an oyster card for trains that I no longer use a library card for books no longer borrowed and even some cash – remember that? These may well be the detritus of a world never to be regained. Will those of us able to work at home ever be allowed back into the office or even want to go for that matter?I had thought that once this nightmare was over, we would all be commuting into cities again, eager to return to the camaraderie and woke minefield of modern office life, but I have my doubts now.Parents whose children have been at home since March and face another two months with the little darlings cannot wait to get back to the office but once the schools have returned they might think differently. Home working by millions will be an abiding legacy of this time with all the implications that will have for the viability of public transport, commercial property management and businesses like cafes, restaurants and taxis that rely on commuters for their livelihoods, especially in London.Foreign travel will change even when the 14-day quarantine for all arrivals is dropped. While there are many people desperate to get back to the beaches of the Med, there are others who find the thought of a masked four-hour queue at the airport intolerable. Eating out, going to the cinema, attending the theatre – all these activities are to reopen but their pleasures constrained by pettifogging rules and for how long?What else will change? The BBC has been running a series of podcasts called Rethink in which leading figures in their fields consider what might happen. One contributor, Lady Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court, suggests that we might reconsider how we use juries in criminal trials.This has been a theme recently among jurists alarmed at the growing backlog in the system. One proposed “temporary measure” is for judges to sit alone or with a couple of lay assessors rather than with a full jury in order to get through the mountain of pending trials. But it would not be a temporary measure. Once introduced it would be hard to get rid of it. Do we want the “new normal” to erode our ancient juridical rights?Or what about Parliament: when will it go back to proper functioning? Now that voting is carried out remotely or by proxy, do we ever see the old system returning or a full complement of MPs allowed back to Westminster? What will that mean for the scrutiny of legislation which was never especially well done and has been almost non-existent in recent weeks?Research by the Hansard Society think tank found that more than \u202890 pieces of legislation, including significant restrictions on people’s freedoms, were pushed through without parliamentary scrutiny. We have lost a great deal in the past few months. We cannot dispense with our democracy as well.Do events like a pandemic create a new reality or accentuate changes that were already lurking beneath the surface? Notwithstanding the death toll, this has not been the catastrophic plague that some had feared and has mercifully spared the young almost entirely, unlike past contagions. Moreover, when Mr Johnson announced what he acknowledged to be an unprecedented curtailment of inidual freedom, he said the aim was to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed.That justification passed some time ago and yet the Government still thinks it should dictate how we conduct our lives, including our most intimate contacts. Provided the people most likely to succumb to the virus are protected then everyone else should be allowed to carry on and assess the risk (low for most) to themselves.Our freedoms cannot continue to be restricted by a fixation on R numbers or assumptions that there will be a “second wave” of the virus which, as Liam Fox said in the Commons, is merely the continuation of a disease that we cannot get rid of and have to live with. The “new normal” is a world devoid of light and liberty. I want the old normal back, please.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have portugal germany finally perfected best route lockdown","story":"Choose your news carefully and there is plenty to fret about over a pint in a social-distanced pub. While bars and restaurants will be reopening in England on July 4, in the German town of Gutersloh they will for the moment be shutting their doors again after an outbreak of Covid-19 in a meat factory. In suburbs of Lisbon, too, a partial lockdown is being reimposed after a rise in local cases. Globally, according to the World Health Organisation, the pandemic is accelerating.Look more calmly, though, and one thing becomes apparent. While the number of recorded cases globally has yet to peak the number of deaths peaked in April and is now running about half the level it was then. While more and more people are being recorded as suffering from Covid-19, fewer are dying. Why?It is partly because the world is performing ever more Covid tests. The more you test, the more Covid-19 you will find. Tests are now picking up asymptomatic cases which would previously have gone undetected. The number of cases recorded is no guide to the true level of incidence of infections. Look at Britain, where officially  there have been 305,000 recorded cases of the disease. Yet the ONS, on the strength of antibody tests, has estimated that 6.78 percent of the population (4.4 million Britons) have been infected. In spite of Matt Hancock’s boast of reaching his target of 100,000 tests a day, we have managed to capture fewer than one in 10 cases of the disease.But there is something else apparent from the data on Covid-19. The wider the infection spreads, the more it is concentrated in younger, less vulnerable age groups. In Portugal, a rise in cases has been blamed on young people partying. However much and irresponsibly they party, however, they have failed to make any impact on the daily death toll, which is in low single figures compared with over 30 back in April.It is a very different situation from March and April when Covid-19 was running riot in care homes all across Europe and North America. In the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control, more than a quarter of tests among the over-65s in March turned out to be positive. That has now fallen to less than five per cent. More cases, by contrast, are now being picked up among children and teenagers – but that doesn’t matter so much because they have a very tiny chance of dying from the disease or suffering any ill effects.If all age groups had the same chance of dying from Covid 19 as do children (who are more likely to die from being struck by lightning), there would be no need to do anything about the disease – it could safely be allowed to rip through the population unchecked. All of which begs the question: why don’t we allow young people to build up society’s herd immunity while simultaneously protecting the elderly and other vulnerable people? This was, in fact, once a policy that was favoured by at least one government scientific adviser.On March 12, Graham Medley, Professor of Infectious Disease Modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a member of Sage, told Newsnight: “If I could, what I would like to do is put all the more vulnerable people into the North of Scotland and keep them there, everyone else in Kent and have a nice big epidemic in Kent so everyone becomes immune, and then we can put people back together again.”Instead, we seemed to do pretty much the opposite: we locked young people away indoors while discharging elderly hospital patients, untested, into care homes where they helped spread the virus unchecked. Eventually, however, we have – accidentally – arrived at more or less is the policy Medley advocated.Young people, fed up with lockdown, are increasingly flouting the rules by partying, going on protests and the like, while many elderly people remain indoors. Black Lives Matter hasn’t done a lot for community relations, stirring up tensions. But it may just have done us a favour by contributing to herd immunity from Covid-19.In Britain, new infections from Covid-19 have fallen to a trickle in any case. In the first half of June, according to the ONS, only around one in 1700 people had the virus at any one time. But if we do get a second spike in infections, it would be madness the repeat the economically-debilitating experiment of total lockdown. We should protect the vulnerable – and let others continue more or less normal life.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside florida model gods waiting room could point way managing","story":"On Monday, Florida hit the grim milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, following a series of record daily totals.But the headline figure is far from the full story. On that same day there were only 12 deaths, and 82 people hospitalised, in a state of 22 million people, which has so many elderly retirees it is known as “God\u0027s waiting room.Florida\u0027s mortality rate - the proportion of deaths per positive cases - has fallen to just 3.4 per cent. That compares to 5.2 per cent for the United States, and the same globally. The UK\u0027s rate is 14 per cent.Most startling of all, the average age of people testing positive has plummeted from 65 in March to 35 now. In some Florida counties it is under 30.The figures reflect the Sunshine State\u0027s strategy of protecting the elderly, while allowing the young and healthy to proceed with life as much as possible.It is an approach not dissimilar to what was originally proposed in the UK and, with the addition of focusing on the elderly, what has played out in Sweden. Going forward, it could provide a model for how the virus can best be managed.If anywhere was set for catastrophe when coronavirus emerged, it was Florida. The state has 691 nursing homes, with about 85,000 beds, and over 3,000 assisted-living facilities, with 106,000 beds.And it is home to numerous resorts for the elderly, including mega-retirement community The Villages, the largest in America, which has over 130,000 senior citizens, with an average age of 70.From the start the approach of Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, was simple - shield the elderly, and let others carry on because they are less likely to get seriously ill, and contribute more to the economy.The result has been a lot of cases, but less deaths, and less pressure on the state\u0027s health system.No special measures were introduced for the elderly. But repeated appeals were made for over-65s to stay home, and avoid crowds. Ultimately, it was each inidual\u0027s decision, but they listened.When the first case was confirmed in The Villages on March 19 public events there had already stopped, and restaurants had switched to takeaway. Churches immediately made services online or drive-thru only.Days later, Mr DeSantis unveiled what he called the most innovative testing site in the country at The Villages. It was a drive-thru centre that tested anyone, regardless of symptoms, and returned results within 72 hours. Testing went on for a month. Scientists hailed it as a global example.Ultimately, despite predictions the virus would devastate The Villages, less than 100 cases have been detected there.Meanwhile, Florida is nearing completion of testing everyone in all its nursing homes. All nursing staff are being tested every two weeks. The governor ordered the National Guard to help with testing.We have a lot of large retirement communities, but overall Florida didn\u0027t get to the point the models predicted we were going to hit. Our older people took note of the need to protect themselves.The shift in cases is in part thanks to them continuing those practices, and younger folks not.Experts like Professor Prins are still worried by the recent spike.The preference is to not have this many cases. this is not a desirable situation. Certainly when we look at younger cases, they\u0027re not hospitalised as often, not as likely to die, she said. But the 25-year-old may still go visit grandma and grandpa.Mr DeSantis was highly reluctant to issue any kind of statewide stay-at-home order, eventually doing so in April, and then starting to reopen as soon as possible in early May.Now, restaurants and bars are operating at 50 per cent capacity, or 100 per cent outdoors. He has not mandated masks.Since Memorial Day on May 25, Floridians have flocked to beaches. Images of sun worshippers avoiding social distancing have given public health officials apoplexy.But the governor is pleased at how the average age for positive cases has shifted in a radical direction younger.Speaking last week in Miami, he said: A trend that’s very important is what is the median age of those people who are testing positive. Those under 40, in particular, who don’t have any underlying conditions are much, much less likely to be hospitalised or to suffer a fatality. We’re not rolling back.The figures appear to back up Mr DeSantis\u0027s approach.Florida has the third highest population of any US state, including a very high proportion of vulnerable elderly people, yet it has had the ninth most deaths - 3,173.That equates to 147 deaths per one million people, far below the US average of 368 per million. For the UK it is 641 deaths per million, whereas New York\u0027s figure is 1,602. Florida is also testing aggressively, with 41,028 tests conducted on Saturday. On that day the percentage of positive tests was 14 per cent, compared to less than six per cent in preceding months. It reflects contact tracing efforts aimed at getting people treated quickly.Meanwhile, doctors have reported the falling age of patients easing pressures on them. In Broward County, the length of hospital admission has fallen from an average of 10 days to six.At the start of the pandemic elderly patients from nursing homes and cruise ships required long stays. Now, the vast majority of younger patients are not admitted, and sent home to recuperate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"return big weekly shop short lived new data shows","story":"The return of the big weekly shop may have been a blip, after the latest figures showed a resurgence in supermarket trips.Tesco boss Dave Lewis said in April that the clock had been turned back “10 or 15 years” on our shopping habits with the lockdown meaning shoppers were visiting the supermarket less frequently but spending more when they got there.However, the latest data from analysts Kantar, showed that an extra 19 million trips to supermarkets were made in the four weeks to June 14 than in the previous month.Matt Botham, from Kantar, said this was an indication that the shift in consumer behaviour was temporary but that, at the current rate of growth, things would not get back to normal until October.The 405 million trips made in that four weeks was still a reduction of 77 million when compared to the previous year.He said: “Each time the Government’s advice shifted you can see it reflected in the shopping data. After the stay home message became stay alert there was a little tick upwards in the data.”Online shopping has continued to prove popular with the volume of sales almost doubling in the time period, an increase of 91 per cent.Meanwhile, the sunny weather and the relaxing of restrictions on seeing friends and family drove a surge in demand for picnic and barbecue items and ice cream.Sales of soft drinks and chilled dips increased by 28 and 30 per cent respectively, while ice cream sales rose by 57 per cent, burgers by 44 per cent and sausages by 40 per cent.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rules lockdown new uk update","story":"The move will enable pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other businesses to be run profitably when they are allowed to reopen on the same day, and will change the way in which schools, shops, transport and workplaces can operate.Mr Johnson told MPs the rate of infection in the community – as opposed to hospitals and care homes – is now low enough to relax the social distancing rule as long as steps are taken to mitigate the risk of people being closer together.Face coverings will be needed in some indoor locations, perspex screens could be used between tables in restaurants and al fresco dining will be encouraged to minimise the risk of transmission.A Downing Street spokesman said: After a long period of asking the public to follow very strict and complex rules, the Government believes we are now in a position to enable people to see more of their friends and family.The infection rate has fallen significantly in the first half of June. Only one in 1,700 people have the virus, compared with an average of one in 400 a month ago.Where it is not possible to stay two metres apart, people are advised instead to keep one metre plus apart – meaning one metre apart plus mitigation.But I must say to the House it will be all too easy for that frost to return. And that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through, and to see us to victory over this virus.Families will be allowed to meet groups of relations or friends indoors for the first time since lockdown began – but there will be a ban on hugging or touching.From July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. That means families could invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There will be no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.The Government decided against an alternative plan to allow two entire households to form one social bubble, partly because it would have forced families to choose which set of relations they could see.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Downing Street admitted people would need to show a lot of discipline and restraint to adhere to the new rules, such as preventing children from hugging grandparents, but stressed that the changes would be swiftly reversed if coronavirus started to spread again.A Number 10 spokesman said: Your household will be able to link with one other household at a time, which includes staying over at someone\u0027s house.This is not a bubble because households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they are indoors or outdoors, so they will need to stay two metres apart or follow the new one-metre plus advice.Hotels, pubs and restaurants will be allowed to reopen from July 4, but customers will be banned from propping up the bar and will have to register their contact details before entering. This will allow customers to sit closer together in venues in which it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. New safety guidance, due to be issued later, will set out a menu of options for hospitality bosses to use as part of the new system. These include more back-to-back seating, perspex screens, partitions between tables, disposable menus and more cleaning of commonly touched surface areas. Waiters will be required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People will be discouraged from returning their glass or ordering from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes will also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the Test and Trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.Hairdressing salons will be able to reopen, but the experience of getting your hair cut is likely to be very different.Hairdressers will be required to wear a full-face plastic visor to reduce the risk of infection and will also need to follow strict rules over the disinfecting of equipment.Customers will have to make appointments, and there will be limits on the amount of people in salons. It is also anticipated that hairstylists will be told to cut down on small talk.But the mass reopening will come with a number of conditions attached. Recommendations to stop coronavirus from spreading include emptying mini bars, offering buffet-free breakfasts and regularly deep cleaning rooms, with 24 hours left between bookings.All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for up to 72 hours between guests.Those checking in should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk and hand sanitiser available throughout. It is thought campsites will be instructed to ensure that tents are pitched further apart than normal so social distancing measures can be adhered to, along with frequent deep cleaning of facility blocks such as showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down. Campers are likely be told they cannot have day visitors in order to further limit the numbers on site. Communal areas such as receptions, shops, laundries and playgrounds are likely to remain closed, with guests advised to bring all their own essentials, including gas canisters.As with hotels and other overnight accommodation, guests will be asked to pay in advance and use contactless payment rather than cash. Changes to the rules, allowing two households to meet up, mean that two families will now be able to go on holiday together.The Prime Minister confirmed: From July 4, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfasts.Mr Johnson did not specifically mention Britain\u0027s 2.2 million shielded people in his statement.However on Monday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, announced that this extremely clinically vulnerable group would finally be able to meet friends and visit relatives\u0027 homes from July 6.Shielded people, considered to be the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, including those with lung conditions and people being treated for cancer, will be able to meet up to five other people outdoors after having been virtual prisoners in their own homes for the past three months.If they live alone they will also be able to form a support bubble with one other household, meaning they can visit their families and stay overnight with them. It is hoped the infection rate will be low enough for shielding to end all together at the end of July, though help will still be available from NHS volunteers and local councils.As long as they continue strict social distancing measures, shielded people will be able to visit supermarkets and places of worship, and those who cannot work from home will be able to return as long as their workplace adheres to Government guidance.Until now, the only easing of lockdown for shielded people has been allowing them to go outside once a day with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance.It advises that shielded children can return to school in line with their peers, provided they wash their hands frequently and adhere to social distancing. Mr Johnson said that Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown and he was pleased to announce that places of worship will reopen for prayer and services, including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing.Weddings will restart from July 4, with up to 30 people able to attend under social distancing rules. From July 4, provided they are Covid-19 compliant:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/23/19/gettyimages-169206619.jpg","title":"columbus statue minnesota saint paul state capitol prince","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Prince represents Minnesota values and Columbus does not’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said.

You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak.

Announcing the new social distancing rule on Tuesday, Mr Johnson stressed it was “preferable” for people to remain two metres apart but said “we can now move to one metre plus where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart”.He added: “That means staying one metre apart plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission and these precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing hand-washing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside of your household and of course being outdoors.“On public transport, it already means one metre plus, it means wearing a face covering for mitigation as everybody I think now understands.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Museums and cinemas in England have been given the green light to reopen their doors to visitors from 4 July, but many smaller venues are still worried about making it through the year.The government has scrapped the two-metre social distancing rule in favour of one metre, a change that has been welcomed by museums and cinemas, which say it will help them reach up to 50 per cent of capacity instead of less than 25 per cent.However, concerns about consumer confidence and whether reopening is financially viable means that some venues, such as heritage museums and independent cinemas, are in “mortal peril”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Bonser-Wilton, chief executive of the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth, told The Independent that lockdown has cost the museum 90 per cent of its income and it would probably take between four to six weeks to make changes to ensure the safety of its staff and visitors.“The prime minister’s announcement is not a surprise and is very welcome, but there is so much uncertainty about whether we will be able to recover from the past few months,” she said.All libraries, museums and galleries in Leeds could closeWhen will nail bars and beauty salons be allowed to reopen in the UK?Drinkers warned risk of catching coronavirus in pubs ‘quite high’Live: PM eases lockdown, as Japan wants trade deal within six weeksWhen will pubs, cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers be open from?“In theory, museums will be able to reopen on 4th of July, but I think very few will. For the Mary Rose, we’re fully indoor and have air conditioning, so we will need to see if we comply by ventilation requirements, we need to order and install things like Perspex screens, review the guidance on toilets and so on.“The issue we’re seeing is the question of how much consumer demand there’s actually going to be. Our cost will likely go up because of all the changes and it’s unlikely we’ll see more than 20 per cent of our usual visitors — it is a risk for all heritage museums because we might lose more money to open than to stay closed. We are in mortal peril if the government doesn’t step in.”Laura Pye, director of the Liverpool Museums group, which aims to reopen the World Museum and the Walker Art Gallery as soon as possible, said it can do so because the spaces are large enough to allow for social distancing but many smaller heritage museums won’t be able to do the same.She said the biggest challenge for the museum sector is seeing how financially viable it will be to reopen, and it will take much longer to reopen smaller venues.“Reopening will be incredibly difficult for a large section of the museum community. The reality is that museums are mostly in historical buildings, have huge amounts of historical and valuable artefacts, so staffing levels will be higher than normal,” she told The Independent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you’re running a small venue, it’s very difficult.”A survey by the Independent Cinema Office (IOC) showed 41 per cent of venues are not confident they can reopen with social distancing measures and majority think they won’t be able to open until September at the earliest.“Despite government suggestion that cinemas could reopen in July, many smaller independent venues are reluctant to open, citing safety of staff and audiences as the main concerns,” said the IOC report.“They feel pressure from the commercial sector the industry as a whole to open when it is not actually financially viable, practical or even safe to do so.”What are the new lockdown rules announced by Boris Johnson?Most of the respondents to the IOC survey also thought they would have a 20 per cent increase in costs to implement health and safety measures, such as additional staffing, PPE, and enhanced cleaning of the venues.Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said the announcement was “very much welcome” and was a “major step forward for recovery in the industry”, but added it was “undoubtedly true” that there will be a significant number of smaller venues who will not want to open for various reasons.“The IOC survey respondents were predominantly from smaller communities, there are a vast number of independent cinemas that will want to open,” he told The Independent.“But smaller sites may decide their audiences are more likely to decide not to come back, may look at a likely film slate in the weeks after cinemas open and decide it’s not strong enough to attract enough people, or simply have too-small entrances to ensure social distancing is possible.“However, we are confident that as things develop, more cinemas will be able to reopen their doors.”Both independent museums and cinemas believe the government will have to step in to help them recover, especially as half the summer period will have passed by the time they are allowed to reopen.Ms Bonser-Wilton called for the government’s furlough scheme to continue until the end of the year and for substantial grants to be provided to “cover essential care costs during the crisis and beyond”.She has also called for an “urgent conversation on building resilience and better funding mechanism for independent heritage charities”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years.

She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Nearly half of the home coronavirus tests sent out by the government are not being sent back or are being returned void, the government has admitted.The revelation casts further doubt on ministers\u0027 claims about how many people they are testing for Covid-19, with home tests making up a substantial chunk of the total.The Government\u0027s testing figures count a test as soon as it is sent out rather than when results are obtained, with the effect of inflating the numbers in time to meet deadlines. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut new statistics released by the Department of Health and Social Care show that 39 per cent of kits are not being sent back, with a further 4.8 per cent of those – 9,761 – returned void.It means that over 4 in 10 of the home testing kits are not actually providing results, a total of around 42 per cent.Majority of British workers want coronavirus spot checksPM accused of \u0027rubbish\u0027 over claim no country has working Covid appThe statistics were released by the government in response to a written parliamentary question on Tuesday. Ministers have previously been coy about releasing the exact figures, but Public Health England told a parliamentary committee last month that certainly more than half were being returned.Officials say tests may be returned void because they either have not been used, sent back without a barcode label, or with the sample container\u0027s lid not screwed on properly. They say there have also been occasions in which the sample provided cannot be processed.The figures, the latest of which related to 25 May 2020, show that 3.6 per cent of home test kits received a positive result and 91.6 per cent received a negative result, with 4.8 per cent void.It is difficult to estimate the exact impact of the low return rate on the overall figures using publicly available data. On the day of the government\u0027s deadline to test 100,000 people alone, 40,000 tests were recorded as either mailed out to homes or satellite centres. The satellite tests are not thought to face the same problems home tests have, but the government does not distinguish between the two methods in the figures it makes public.Labour\u0027s shadow health minister Justin Madders said: For just under half of these tests not to be returned or to have been voided shows that the Government have got little control over the testing system.

As we move out of lockdown it is vital that Ministers demonstrate they have a proper plan to get a grip of the all too apparent holes in the current testing system.Earlier this month the UK\u0027s top statistician branded the government\u0027s testing statistics misleading. UK Statistics Authority chair Sir David Norgrove said in a scathing letter to the Health Secretary that the government’s presentation of testing figures “falls well short” of normal standards.Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We have stood up a new testing programme at pace with capacity for over 280,000 tests a day to make sure anyone in England of any age can get a test, either at home or by visiting one of our regional centres.“We were clear from the outset about how we counted our tests, and we continue to work hard to continually improve the data we publish.“It is essential for everyone who orders a test to use it and return it to the lab in a timely manner to help control the virus and save lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’m not apologising for that at all.‘Grave risk’ of Windrush-style scandal again unless Home Office actsWatchdog to review hostile environment policy in light of Windrush “It is right that we treat each inidual with the respect and dignity they deserve. These are complicated cases.”The home secretary also announced that her department would accept the recommendations of the review into the Windrush scandal – published in March – in full.“The review itself is damning of the conduct of the Home Office and unequivocal about the ignorance and institutional thoughtlessness towards the race and the history of the Windrush generation by the department,” she said.“There are serious and significant lessons for the Home Office to learn.”During the sitting, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper raised the cases of two men who were told in January that their cases were nearly finalised, but had made no progress since.One of these iniduals was Anthony Williams, who served in the armed forces for 13 years, and the other Andrew Bynoe, who was made homeless due to issues with his immigration status.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is the ideological feelings of all our people and our national customs that this can never be allowed to be encroached upon.”Despite the outrage from officials, Fighters For A Free North Korea – a southern group with northern defectors in its number – launched 20 balloons carrying 500,000 leaflets, 2,000 one-dollar bills and small books over the border from the town of Paju on Monday evening.Mr Park, a North Korean campaigner in the group who fled the country said his leafleting was part of “a struggle for justice for the sake of liberation” of his former countrymen.However Seoul’s unification ministry, which handles relations with North Korea, has expressed “deep regret” over Mr Park’s activism.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean. Not Pam.“Is Dad a James Bond fan by any chance ” cooed Britt on the website Cameo. “I’m here to fulfil your wildest desires.”Wow – you’ve got one old dad going now, Britt!You couldn’t get me a signed photo of Ana de Armas, could you AND they’re off!” cried Lizzie Cundy. No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After the toughest restrictions in peacetime history, we are now able to make le easier for people to see more of their friends and families and help businesses get back on their feet and get back to work. But the virus has not gone away, there will be flare upsToday we can say our long national hibernation is beginning to come to our end and le is ing to our streets and our shops.The bustle is starting to come back and a new but cautious optimism is palpable.Pubs, restaurants,and cinemas are all able to reopen in England. People will be able to spend time - including going to a restaurant - with one other household at a time. The PM has slashed the  metre rule, telling people to stay  metre away as long as they take other precautions including face coverings. The Prime Minister said all of the four nations of the UK were moving in the same direction - eventhey were doing it at dferent times. He said: The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland hold responsibility for their own lockdown restrictions    and they will respond to the united view of the Chief Medical Officers at their own pace, based on their own judgment.  But all parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction and we will continue to work together to ensure that everyone in our country gets the support they need.In a major update today, Boris announced:But Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly stressed the need to take a slow approach to easing the lockdown. In Scotland, people are allowed to meet up in groups of eight people outdoors and in private gardens. But those groups shouldnt consist of more than two households.Ms Sturgeon announced last week they would be allowed to go inside one anothers homes to use the toilet - weeks after the PM said people in England could do the same thing. She has also said people who are in single-adult households can form a support bubble with another household. But outside of those support bubbles, people cannot go into one anothers homes. She has also said she could push the date pubs are allowed to open because of fears they could be virus hotspots. Non-essential retail in Scotland will be allowed to reopen at the end of this week, after those in England started welcome people back in on June . All Scots have been told to stay local to their area, but the First Minister said she hopes to reopen tourism by July . One of Ms Sturgeons top scientic advisers has suggested the current  metre rule could be changed in Scotland.National Clinical Director Jason Leitch told BBC this morning: “I don’t think we are going to be physically distanced forever. We are going to learn to live with this infectious disease, like we live with tuberculosis and flu. I think physical distancing will change. I am just not entirely sure when.”In Wales, people also have to follow stricter rules than across the border in England.People can meet outside - but not with more than one household. The Welsh Government has also put in guidance telling people to stay local - but new rules allow them to travel outside the five-mile radius of their home to check up on relativeson compassionate grounds. That can include visiting loved ones in care homesthe homes give permission. Schools in Wales have been told to prepare to reopen to pupils from all years from  June. People have to maintain a  metre social distancing rule with people outside their household at all times in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that stay-local rules will stay in place until at least July . He said: I really understand thatyou are just the other side of a border, you will feel that this is rough justice, and other people are being able to do things that you cant.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some hair salons have said they will be opening at midnight on July  to clear a backlog of  months, with one London hairdresser preparing to deal with a queue of , people desperate for a trim.Hellen Ward from Richard Ward Hair and spa in London said: It will take a while, partly because we have to work out what they have done to their hair during lockdown to work out how long a booking will take.Ms Ward said she expected to see a few bad DIY haircuts from people who had attempted to trim their own hair. The new  metre rule means Ms Ward can have  chairs in her salon instead of . Co-founder of Salon Sloane in London Belle Cannan said: Itwill help because we are a small salon and only have eight positions.Going from two metres to one metre makes it much more of a viable business because you can accommodate more clients, and of course everyone is desperate to come in, especially in the first week to get their hair done.Ms Cannan, whose clients include Victorias Secret models and former Spice Girl Melanie C, said the changes would allow her salon to increase its capacity from % to %.She said staff will wear protective visors and will be required to wipe down chairs and equipment before and after every customer.Hairdressers in Northern Ireland will be able to reopen on July , while the Welsh Government is expected to review an official opening date on July .In a major update today, Boris announced:Another salon - The Chair in Canterbury, Kent, revealed it will open from midnight to pm on July  to get a headstart on a flood of appointments.

All hairdressers will be required to wear full-face plastic visors to reduce the risk of infection. There will also be strict rules about disinfecting equipment.Customers will only be allowed in by appointment and there will be a limit on numbers. Officials are also weighing up whether to allow beauty salons and nail bars to open on July .

It would have been in the paper, there would have been big talk,” Ms Smith said. Grant, who died in , is alleged to have been drinking alcohol on the night of the crash. His  acquittal attracted no major media attention.Grant was acquitted of culpable driving causing death with his lawyers arguing that Mona was behind the wheel when the car crashed.Investigators did not test for Monas fingerprints on the steering wheel. In March this year, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller sent a letter to Attorney-General Mark Speakman stating that two independent inquiries found the police handling to be “adequate”.Mr Fuller said that because Grant is now dead, an inquest into the girls deaths “will adduce new or additional information”.Monas sister Fiona Smith said the police commissioners letters angered her.   She said: “I didnt like what I read in the letters. I dont agree with it and neither does [Monas mother]. Its like theyre ducking and weaving and no one wants to take responsibility.Ms Smiths lawyers have called on the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions to reassess its response.  “What was important was the evidence, accepted by the magistrate, that Cindy was dead when she was found by two independent witnesses, and that an alleged ­offencetook place after that,” solicitor George Newhouse from the National Justice Project said.The -year-old’s mother and Bourke indigenous elder Dawn Smith said the Director of Public Prosecutions decision to drop a sexual offence charge against Grant was “disappointing”.In  a charge against Grant to “offer indignity to a dead human body” was dropped just days out from his District Court Trial.Cindy’s family were not aware of the decision which is reportedly one of the reasons he avoided time in jail. The interference with a corpse charge was later dropped because the coroner was unable to determine the exact time that Cindy died and may have been alive while she was assaulted. Grant never faced any jail time before dying in . Last year the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions apologised for failing to inform the family of the withdrawal of charges but maintained it made the correct legal decision.  “I have not been able to identy any error in the ultimate decision that was made or this ­offices consideration of the relevant legal issues,” NSW Public Prosecutions, Huw Baker SC, told the family in a letter from last November.     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping. What you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm.

But when the coronavirus crisis struck, the two of them were plunged into compulsory lockdown on the beautul -acre isle off the Pembrokeshire coast. With only seabirds for company, the situation has left them even more isolated than usual. Sylwia, who is using her spare time to learn the ukulele, says: “Every few weeks we take our boat to collect our online supermarket order from friends, and we alternate cooking duties. “You need to be OK with being in isolation, and not being able to just pop to the shops. You have to plan ahead and be able to enjoy the changes in the weather.”  In normal times, Skomer attracts up to  visitors a day, drawn by the chance to see the island’s wildle - but coronavirus cut this off virtually overnight, and the Wildle Trusts was faced with having to withdraw the wardens. However, thanks to a grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund – part of a wider £m National Lottery allocation to help good causes affected by the pandemic’s impact – Nathan and Sylwia can continue protecting Skomer’s unique bird habitats.  National Lottery players have raised £m which will support good causes through the coronavirus. We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the global pandemic. But thanks to you, essential funding is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and the good causes most impacted by coronavirus. Click here to learn more about how you are helping - or visit national-lottery news While living on the island, Nathan initially came down with symptoms of the coronavirus and had to self-isolate for two weeks, then the pair struggled to get food deliveries But now they’re embracing the situation. Their work involves collecting data on breeding seabirds, including puffins and Manx shearwaters, and helping to protect them from other species – humans among them. “The island is really fragile,” says Nathan. “Puffins and shearwaters nest in burrows, so the ground is like a honeycomb. It’s important that people stay on the paths.”  Both are missing their families on the mainland, though. Nathan is also craving ice cream, while Sylwia pines for fresh strawberries. Meanwhile they, and two other wardens, have been sharing their work online via video blogs. And despite the crisis, the pair are counting their blessings.“We know how lucky we are to have a job on a remote island,” says Nathan. “We appreciate all the support from The National Lottery and the people who play it.” “It’s a very special place to work in and it’s definitely a privilege,” Sylwia adds Next we hear from another duo who have been separated from their loved ones in lockdown in Slough and find out how theyaposve been making the most of it too... Pensioners transform lounge into yoga studio  Like many loving grandparents, Rajinder and Usha Mehta have found being separated from their family in lockdown a challenge. But the couple have made the most of their time by turning their lounge into a yoga and dance studio, thanks to online classes run by a local National Lottery-funded community group. Rajinder, , and Usha, , live in Slough. While they’ve at least been able to see their son and two-year-old youngest granddaughter from a distance, they have also managed to stay close to their wide circle of friends through shared virtual exercise classes, WhatsApp groups, regular phone calls and even cooking challenges. The couple have been active members of the National Lottery-funded Apna Virsa voluntary community organisation for four years. It was co-founded by friends Seema Kamboj and Bobbi Johal in , with the aim of bringing together members of the vibrant South Asian community in the Slough area. Since then it has grown to have hundreds of members, and works in close partnership with other community groups, running yoga, pilates, wellbeing and bhangra dance classes, alongside community meet-ups and other services catering for a broad age range and uniting people from many dferent cultures. “Social isolation is a big issue, particularly among older members of the community, and early on we also recognised a need around peopleaposs health,” says Seema. “We’ve always consulted with the local community about the kind of services they want, and the classes we run have proved really popular.  “When lockdown hit, we knew we had to keep bringing people together, so we ran with the challenge and moved our classes online. It’s been amazingly successful, and our reach has risen from a maximum of  people in a class pre-lockdown, to as many as , views for one of our Facebook Live dance sessions. We even had the charity Shelter ask us to share our social media tips!” Apna Virsa was awarded National Lottery funding for its Wellbeing Matters project, launched in March , and some of that money has now supported it going virtual. “People have been sharing videos and photos, we’ve had weekly highlights on Facebook and a recipe of the week shared via WhatsApp,” says Seema. “It’s all these little things in lockdown that keep people positive and motivated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown changes everything you","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdown changes: Everything you can and cant do in England from July Boris Johnson has today given the green light for cinemas, galleries, museums, pubs, restaurants, bars, hotels, hairdressers and barbers to reopen from July  - while overnight stays with friends will be allowed.

Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can open bang on Saturday  July - despite fears itaposs too soon to unlock the nation, especially all at once. Two households will also be able to meet indoors and even stay overnight - as long as they maintain social distancing. And the two-metre social distancing rule will be cut down to a one metre plus rule, with people able to be closerthey sit side-by-side or wear a mask. The death toll of people with coronavirus in the UK today passed , and stands at ,. And scientists warn the risk of catching Covid- is ten times higher at m away than m away. Yet Boris Johnson told his Cabinet the changes were crucial to rescue the economy, which has plunged into recession thanks to the pandemic. He told Parliament: Our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end.But the PM also warnedthe virus surges too soon, the nation will be forced back into lockdown potentially region by region. Todayaposs changes come after the PM held a crunch meeting with his two top scientic advisors last night. The trio will appear later today at the pm press conference to offer more explanation. Later we are expecting detailed guidance on exactly what pubs, hotels and other venues will have to look like when they reopen. But key venues including hostels, soft play areas, gyms, swimming pools and nightclubs all remain shut. So what exactly has the Prime Minister announced so far and how will it affect you  Hereaposs everything you need to know. Things you can do from July  Venues that CAN reopen in England from July  All these venues can reopen in England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Cinemas Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos.You can finally visit friends and family indoors - but you canapost hug  People in England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight from July  - but they can’t hug. For the first time since March, indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules - aren’t being expanded, for now. But new rules will allow two households in England to meet indoors. This applies to all indoor gatherings, be they in private homes or in places like pubs. When you are indoors, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house.  There is no limit on the size of either of the households which can meet. And unlike with bubbles, ’exclusivity’ is not required. So you can have one friend round for a meal one weekend and another friend round another weekend. But there’s a big catch - these households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they meet, That means following the m or ‘m plus’ guidance, and also following other advice such as regular hand washing. You can meet more people outdoors  There will be a slight change to the rules for people meeting outdoors from July . Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing. This will continue, but there will also now be another option. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - will now also be allowed to meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. The two-metre rule will be cut  Changes will be made to the -metre rule in England from July . Where it’s not possible to stay  metres apart, people will instead be advised to keep to a social distance of “one metre plus”. This means staying one metre apart - plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. On public transport it means people stay one metre away but with a face covering. In other spaces it will likely mean having screens between tables, making sure people face away from each other, putting in hand washing facilities, minimising amount of time spent with people from dferent households., and being outdoors where possible. Government sources claim having such mitigations in place at one metre away can have a “broadly equivalent impact” on transmission as staying two metres apart. But it comes despite grave warnings of the danger of moving people closer together. Scientists say the risk of catching coronavirus from someone is  to  times higher at one metre away compared to two metres away. Yet now fewer people have coronavirus in society overall, the overall risk of catching it is lower. And Tory MPs and the pub trade have piled pressure on Boris Johnson to cut the distance to save the economy. Crucially, the review was led by No and while it took advice from scientists, they had no powers of veto. Economists also contributed to the review.  Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens can all reopen in England from July  - both indoor and outdoors. But thereaposs a catch -youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. But landlords won’t be expected to police what household customers belong to, or check ID of everyone coming in. Guidance for pubs will be published later today. You can get a haircut - but canapost get your nails done  Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to reopen in England from July  with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. It means millions of Brits can finally get a haircut after more than three months of having their locks chopped at home. But nail salons, which involve people sitting face to face, will remain shut for the foreseeable. You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels  Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses can all reopen to paying guests in England from July . Again, they must follow Covid-secure guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites will be able to reopen in England from July . This would include showers and washing-up blocks. There will be Covid-secure guidelines to minimise the spread of the virus. But hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet. This is dferent to Wales which is keeping both campsites and hostels shut. You can go to visit cinemas, galleries and museums  The government has now officially set the date of Saturday  July for cinemas, galleries and museums to reopen in England. Guidance will be published shortly on how to keep them safe - including one-way systems, spaced queuing, increased ventilation, and pre-booked tickets. A No source said: We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these stepsit is necessary to stop the virus running out of control.  Today comes hot on the heels of last nightaposs announcement that shielding will be eased for .million vulnerable people in England. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end on August , prompting alarm. Thereaposs also anger at the failure to have a legal safeguard against people being forced back to work. Things you still canapost do from July  Venues that CANaposT reopen in England from July  Government sources said “it’s not felt that at this moment in time it’s possible” for those venues to reopen. Task forces will be set up to try to get these venues open in a safe way. Nightclubs Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Spas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Water parks Indoor fitness and dance studios Gyms Conference centres, other than for people who already work there. You canapost go to the gym  Government sources said gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden later insisted: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. You canapost send your child to school  Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Full plans for September are due to be announced next week. You canapost see a live theatre show  Theatres and concert halls can reopen in England from July  - with a catch. They can only reopen on the basis it’s not a live performance. Instead theatres and concert halls can screen past performances. Government sources said theatres have an issue with ensuring the actors themselves can move around the stage in a safe way. You canapost sing in church Worship will be allowed - but not full singing services due to the risk of spreading the virus. There will be further guidance about singing. You can get married, but not have a proper reception  Wedding services with up to  people will be allowed from July . But trips to indoor hospitality venues should still only be with one other household - in other words, the rules make wedding receptions almost impossible. This also applies to baptisms and Bar Mitzvahs and other “le cycle events”. The number of people allowed to celebrate a wedding will be increased at some point but it’s not known when or by how much. You canapost play cricket, football or rugby, except with your own household "},{"url":null,"title":"government commits implementing windrush review","story":"NewsGovernment commits to implementing Windrush review recommendations in fullPriti Patel pledged toto the House of Commons to explain what action will beShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN News \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And she said more than £m has been offered in compensation to those affected by the scandal. But her announcement was met with a string of reports from MPs of constituents who still have outstanding cases two years on. Labour criticised the government for being too slow to respond - having managed to compensate just  people so far.Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas Symonds said: “That rate of progress is just too slow given the number of years that have elapsed since this scandal first came to light and already this scheme has been in operation for over a year. Ms Patel refused to apologise for the pace of compensation as the inidual cases are “complicated”, but admitted it had been “far too slow” She pledged toto the Commons with a further statement later in the year, confirming what specic actions would be taken to meet the demands of the report. The Home Secretary told MPs: I was clear when Wendy Williams published her Lessons Learned Review that I would listen and I would act. I have heard what she has said and I will be accepting the recommendations she has made in full. I am committed to ensuring that the Home Office delivers for each part of the community it serves and I will come back to update the House on how we will be implementing the recommendations before the summer recess. It comes after the Home Secretary announced a new working group to right the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation. Ms Patel will chair the new Windrush Cross-Government Working Group with Bishop Derek Webley as part of the Governmentaposs efforts to address the scandal. SNP justice and home affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry called for a root and branch review of the hostile environment policy. She said: Itaposs all very well to agree that Black Lives Matter, but actions speak louder than words and the reality is that many of this Governmentaposs immigration policies continue to have disproportionate impacts on BAME communities andthe Home Secretary does not carry out the root and branch review of the hostile environment policy this will continue.

How could I forget  We’d been ­reminiscing about our fun times at secondary school, gossiping behind books in maths, and laughing until we cried in the canteen. However, we were sidetracked by the startling memory of my intelligent, well-behaved friend getting an excessive punishment for using a Caribbean expression of irritation that, though commonplace to us, was alien to our teacher, and unfairly read as offensive. Remembering this moment of youthful injustice, as chants of “Black Lives Matter” and tales of cross-cultural mishaps fill newspapers and social media, feels incredibly timely. For a number of black British people, school is the first arena where you realise your race will have a direct effect on your le experience. Through the texts taught in English and drama – mostly by white authors, about white characters – to the limited time dedicated to the history of black people, you begin to get the feeling that the stories of your ancestors aren’t worthy of telling, or that characters with names with similar origins to your own are outside of the norm. Unorm and appearance ­policies may discriminate against your natural hair while teachers who don’t ­understand the way you express ­yourself may be too eager to punish.  Four months ago, Ruby Williams won a £, settlement from her East London school after a three-year legal battle – she had been repeatedly sent home because theof her natural afro hair was deemed to be against unorm policy. The Timpson review on school exclusions, released in May , revealed black and mixed students in ­particular have been excluded at disproportionate rates compared to their white peers. And when there are day-to-day cultural crossed wires, as well as discriminative policies which penalise students for being who they are, it is easy to see reasons why. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence to prove many black people feel let down by teachers due to institutionally racist structures. It is not just in the past. A -year-old mixed race student from York who we will call Celine, says secondary school has left her ­disappointed at the way her teachers fail to intervene with racial incidents. “I heard a rumour of an ‘N-word pass’ going around my classmates,” she says, “where anyone who had it would be ‘allowed’ to say the word with no ­consequences. “I’m the only person in the school with black heritage. It was a joke to everyone , but only I was the one who really ­understood the pain, and the history behind it.” Celine reported the matter to mainly white staff. Yet, while the school’s written policy declared no tolerance for offensive language, she was dismayed to find that the culprit was back in class as usual the next day. “I know this student’s character I’m sure it’s just a misunderstanding,” the student-liaison officer explained. “It felt asthe teachers just expected me to get over it, and that they didn’t understand why I was feeling so affected by it,” Celine says. “It makes me feel asconcerns about racial abuse aren’t important.” Figures published in  found just % of state-funded schools’ teachers are from black and other minority ­backgrounds, compared to % of pupils.  This means an extra , teachers from BAME backgrounds are needed to reflect school populations. For some black pupils, negative experiences in school can also stem from staff members’ implicit bias. Entrepreneur Quincy Dash recalls an occasion where, in his Liverpool sixth-form college, a teacher gave him the nickname “Trouble”. Quincy was the only black student in the class. “She’d just met me, and I was even wearing a suit – so why was I ‘Trouble’ to her ” he asks. Trainee solicitor Zoe Browne remembers her experience at school in Islington, North London, in the early s as one where she had to fiercely advocate for herself in order to receive the chance to achieve high grades. One teacher refused to enter her for the Higher GCSE business exam, opting for the Foundation level exam and effectively capping her grade at C , instead of a potential A* .  Zoe explained to the teacher she needed to take the Higher paper to boost her chances of becoming a lawyer. She was told: “People like you don’t become lawyers. You can go on to do your Hair and Beauty BTEC I don’t think A Levels are for you”. This declaration drove Zoe to tears. “Most black students were entered for the Foundation paper teachers didn’t care about us,” she says, certain that race, rather than capability, was the deciding factor. Eventually, her teacher relented, and Zoe achieved a B .  In , then Education Minister Damian Hinds said “far more teachers from ethnic minorities” are needed in schools and to be role models – a sentiment echoed by teachers. I spoke to a teacher, based in South East London, who told the positive effect she had as one of the only black educators at her previous school. “There was such a love and affinity for me because I really saw them, and they saw themselves in me,” she admits. “We all need role models because it instils in you the knowledge of what you can achieve. “Systemic racism means while white people can look on the TV, in ­magazines and in their schools for examples of positive role models, it’s not the same for black students, and it puts them at a disadvantage.” Institutional racism affects teachers too.

Mohamed Derbah said Palmer used the alleged tape in a failed bid to stop a timeshare fraud probe that would land him in jail. The extraordinary allegation can be revealed as police issue a new appeal for information on the fth anniversary of Palmer’s unsolved murder. Derbah, at the centre of Palmer’s Tenere empire for a decade, said his former boss got the tape through underworld contacts. He said: “He launched into a coup d’etat against the British Government, which, although it did not succeed, showed his arrogance and contempt for the law.”  Derbah claimed the video “got into the hands” of people close to the top of Government with a message from Palmer “to leave him alone and close the police investigation”. He added: “It showed Palmer’s determination to avoid... going to prison.” Palmer, , was again facing jail when he was shot by a hitman in his garden in South Weald, Essex, on June , . H e had been told that week he would stand trial in Spain on claims of timeshare fraud, money laundering and firearms offences. There was speculation in the underworld that he was offering to inform on other criminals infor having the charges dropped. Police believe this is the most likely motive for his murder. Lebanese-born Derbah, , became Palmer’s right-hand man after they met in  in Liberia and Sierra Leone where they were involved in the diamond trade.  His extraordinary claims are made in a book called Mohamed Jamil Derbah, The True History of an Entrepreneur, which was published in Spanish. It tells how Palmer – dubbed Goldfinger after smelting gold from the £million Brink’s-Mat robbery in  – asked Derbah to work for him in Tenere as the CEO of his hotel business. In the s Palmer was at the peak of his powers and was worth an estimated £million.Derbah says he was surrounded by his British pals known as “The Family” including Kenneth Noye, who he protected when the thug went on the run for the  road rage murder of Stephen Cameron.  The relationship between Derbah and Palmer began to sour in  and they became locked in a feud over rival timeshare operations in Tenere. Derbah said Palmer was “destroyed by his ambitions” and that he “adored evil” which meant he could not “escape his powerful enemies”. Former Met Detective Chief Inspector Peter Kirkham dismissed as “ridiculous” the idea of Scotland Yard being forced into dropping a probe due to blackmailing of the Government.  He said: “It ain’t going to happen and no one with an ounce of common sense would think that it could.” "},{"url":null,"title":"live lockdown coronavirus updates uk","story":"NewsCoronavirus UPDATES live: Covid- ravages UK meat factories as third factory is hitProfessor Chris Whitty added that there may be a point in the future when a \"particular bit of decisions taken\" may be seen as \"too much of a risk with the benefit of hindsight\"ShareByAbigail OLearyUpdated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video you-need-know-june--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Roo Rawal was dismissed for gross misconduct after a member of the public filmed him urinating in a lay-by after getting caught short while driving his delivery van. But the veteran postie named at least  colleagues who had also peed in public and not been fired, with the tribunal hearing of some who had been nabbed taking a leak in peopleaposs gardens. One postman told the hearing “there was not a post person alive, man or woman, who... had not been caught short...and had to urinate in public.” The murky issue of how postmen respond to calls of nature while doing their rounds was laid bare at an employment tribunal in Watford, Herts. The hearing was told Mr Rawal had worked at the townaposs depot for  years and had also been a Health and Safety officer for the CWU union. In September  his bosses received an emailed complaint from a member of the public to say they were aposcompletely shockedapos to have seen a postman urinating on the side of the road in the town. They had captured the moment on a dashcam video, they said. It was really upsetting seeing someone doing that on the street, especially someone from a big, famous and professional company as Royal Mail, the complaint read. Thataposs a very busy street where even children can see him. We can confirm we are still distressed by this disturbing behaviour and we really hope you will do something about it. When confronted about the incident, Mr Rawal at first said he couldnapost remember it but later admitted that he had got so desperate to pee he couldnapost wait until he got to a nearby supermarket to use the facilities. He was sacked later that year by bosses at Royal Mail for gross misconduct. But the tribunal was told of two specic cases - including one where a postie had weed next to a front door - where the culprits had been caught by customers urinating on their property and had not been fired. Veteran postman Adam Hicks told the hearing it happens aposall the timeapos. Due to the nature of their job and the lack of facilities that there are instances where postman are desperately bursting to go to the toilet, we have no option but to urinate while on duty, he said. Another, Nicholas Williams, told the  he had been personally caught urinating by a customer, but had not been formally disciplined.

But the women became enraged when Mr Sutton took hold of the animalaposs lead in a bid to control it. Mr Roberts said: Chantelle Bennett was shouting at Mr Sutton, ‘Let go of my dog’. She was screaming at him. “She approached with a bottle in her hand and she was indeed trying to hit his partner with the bottle. “Mr Sutton pushed her to the back of the neck and to the floor. “She smashed the bottle of Desperadoes alcohol. Rebecca Tantrum left the address and came towards Mr Sutton with the hammer. “During the incident, Bennett shouted, ‘Go on. Whack him!’ and Tantrum said, ‘I’m going to kill you.’”  CCTV showed Tantrum swinging the hammer at Mr Suttonaposs body and Bennett punching him before the three fall to the floor. Cardf Crown Court heard they grappled before police arrived at the scene in Newport city centre. Bennett and Tantrum, of Newport, admitted actual bodily harm and Tantrum also admitted possessing an offensive weapon and cannabis. Jeffrey Jones, defending, Bennett said: “There was an element of provocation. She was manhandled to the ground.” Rosamund Rutter, for Tantrum, said: “She is appalled by her actions.” But the women were spared jail because of police delays in bringing the case to court. Judge Jeremy Jenkins said he was unable to lock the women up because the attack happened almost a year ago and the women hadnapost been charged sooner. He said: Each of these defendants deserves to go immediately into custody for their violent behaviour.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, leading the University of Oxford vaccine trial, said that when Covid- transmission was high, lockdown was imposed to bring the rate down. But since then rates have dropped, and the trial relies on a sufficient number of volunteers to have been exposed to the virus to see whether a vaccine protects them or not. However,their chances of being in contact with an infected person are low, it will take a long time to demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccine candidate. Prof Gilbert told the House of Lords Science and Technology committee: Of course, what happened was that because it [transmission] actually increased much more rapidly than anybody thought was going to happen, we had the lockdown, which fortunately reduced transmission. Not so fortunate for those of us trying to develop vaccines in the UK, because we now have essentially a very large safety immunogenicity study, running in the UK with little chance, frankly, of determining efficacy. She added that the researchersapos approach was to work with multiple dferent countries in dferent settings to give them the best chance of seeing efficacy in at least one of those countries. The committee heard the Oxford team is already running a trial in Brazil because the numbers of transmissions are much higher than in the UK. As soon as we get a signal of efficacy and can compare that to the level of immunity that weaposre generating, that gives all vaccine developers really helpful information to let them know whether their vaccines are likely to work as well, and whether it will be one dose or two doses, and in older people and in younger people, she said. Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog So the first efficacy signal is going to be really important and as yet we donapost know which country will be generating that. Prof Gilbert and Professor Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial College London trial, said they were optimistic about their vaccine approaches but cautioned that optimism should be balanced against known risk of success. Prof Shattock said vaccine success rates tend to be at about % once you start clinical testing, but added: I think in the UK we are very lucky that we have two [vaccine] candidates that are already in clinical evaluation. We think that probably both of those will work inidually.

Up and down the country people have been standing on markers to ensure they stay cm behind the person ahead, and trying to visualise what two metres looks like when thereaposs no guide to help them. The move, recommended by the UK governmentaposs top scientic advisers, was implemented in March to help slow down the spread of coronavirus. While itaposs possible for people queuing in supermarkets and to enter high street stops, pub landlords and restaurateurs have said the rules would prevent them from making any money when theyaposre allowed to reopen. On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the new one metre plus rule that would help businesses in England, such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels, reopen from early July. What is the one metre plus rule  This new social distancing measurement would mean people can be one metre away from people they donapost live with,they make additional efforts to protect themselves. Efforts to mitigate transmission include avoiding face-to-face seating, reducing the number of people inside, improving ventilation, installing protective screens and additional hand sanitiser. Officials have concluded that following this new guidance would be the same, in terms of public safety, to the existing two-metre rule. These changes will apply to England only. What does it mean for pubs, restaurants and hairdressers  The businesses most affected by the existing rule are set to be told they can reopen as soon as Saturday July .

When the coronavirus lockdown is eased from July , customers may be required to show ID when they order a drink or food, and car parks could be transformed into beer gardens. It will be table service only, tables will be spaced apart or ided by perspex screens, and some pubs will use menus that will be thrown out after each use. Pubs, restaurants and hotels are expected to turn their spaces inside out this summer as they reopen their doors for the first time since late March in a bid to save the hard pressed hospitality sector.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email.     Boris Johnson has set out plans to allow pubs, restaurants, hotels, museums, theme parks and cinemas, among other places, to begin re-opening. The Prime Minister announced the Governmentaposs keenly-awaited review of the two-metre social-distancing rule on Tuesday, confirming it would be cut to one metre plus. The move follows intense pressure from some Tory MPs who have said easing the two-metre requirement is key to re-opening the hospitality sector. Many pubs and restaurants have been operating takeaway and delivery services. But the sector has warned that it would simply not be viable for them to operate as long as the two-metre rule remains in place, and thousands of jobs are at risk. Some scientists have, however, expressed concern the Government is moving too quickly, and that its track-and-trace system to contain any fresh outbreaks is not fully up and running. Here is what pubs could look like when they reopen from July , a day being dubbed Super Saturday. Book before visiting a pub  Punters may have to pre-book a table as pubs try to manage numbers due to social distancing restrictions. Some pubs have said all their tables have already been reserved on opening day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had earlier suggested people may have to register their details online before they visit a pub. It would be part of contacting tracing efforts in case of a fresh Covid- outbreak. Mr Hancock told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: I wouldnapost rule it out, it isnapost a decision weaposve taken yet, but there are other countries in the world that take that approach. PPE Pubs and restaurants will have to adhere to extremely strict rules. Staff are likely to be wearing PPE such as face coverings, plastic face shields or gloves. Ban on ordering at bar  Punters will be banned from ordering at the bar in a bid to prevent crowding and limit contact between customers and staff. Instead, customers will be required to order at their table or through a smartphone app. Show ID when you order Each customer will be required to leave their name and contact details when they arrive. This measure would allow the authorities to carry out contact tracing should a Covid- outbreak occur. It had been suggested pubs and restaurants could ask customers to show ID to prevent them from leaving a fake name.  The industry hit out at that idea, citing privacy concerns and saying it would put unfair pressure on pubs because there is no similar requirement for retail shops. Pubs could be patrolled There was a suggestion at the weekend that pubs could be patrolled to make sure social distancing rules are being followed. By the time pubs reopen, the two-metre rule will likely be slashed to one metre or one metre plus. No standing outdoors  There could be a ban on standing while enjoying a pint with friends outside some pubs. In Westminster, central London, the council is planning to transform places such as Chinatown and Soho into a continental-style outdoor dining area in a bid to keep restaurants and bars afloat. The plans include a ban on standing and drinking outside. Beer gardens in car parks Ministers are drawing up plans allowing pub car parks and hotel grounds to be converted into temporary beer gardens this summer, thereported. Legislation to be introduced as early as Thursday will include changes to licensing laws to allow pubs, restaurants and hotels to turn their spaces inside out this summer.  It is hoped it will lead to a surge in al fresco dining and drinking. A source told the newspaper: At the moment, you [pubs and restaurants] have to specy in the plan for your licence where you are selling and serving alcohol. Beer gardens tend to be licensed already but car parks arenapost. You could have little courtyards that would be normally used for storage, car parks or land that you donapost normally license. A lot of hotels will have huge gardens but wonapost have an outdoor licence. Extended hours or one-off events Changes to the law would make it easier for pubs, restaurants and hotels to hold one-off events or extend the hours and activities permitted under their licence, thereported. More applications for road and street closures would also be granted, the report added. Social distancing  Punters will be required to maintain social distancing and pubs will undertake several measures to make it happen. Tables will be placed far apart and some pubs could install perspex screens. Some pubs could use disposable menus that are binned after a single use. Others could use a blackboard or a digital form. Restaurants can no longer lay tables in advance. Strict sanitising measures will be in place. Customer limits Due to the social distancing requirements, there will be a limit on how many customers are allowed. It could mean one in, one out policies or having to book a slot to help manage numbers. Some pubs could also use one-way systems for entering and exiting premises. Book a toilet break A Manchester tech firm has developed an app called Sort-It, which pubs and restaurants can use to force customers to book a trip to the toilet. It can also be used to order food and drink from the table.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgers was described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

Itrsquos not just in the countryside that they have become a large part of our lives, a source of ersion, fascination and even, or so I have felt, of company. Stepping outside in the morning is like entering the Usher Hall during warm-up, a discordant and energetic orchestra of flutes, pipes and trumpets. As I brush my teeth, I sometimes see Wilf, the blackbird with the silver ankle ring, by the chimney, letting the wind ruffle his feathers. He has a very keen look, and when our eyes meet, you feel you have been noted. By evening, his spot is taken by a pair of turtle doves which perch side by side on the TV aerial, well camouflaged against the dusky sky.Alan saw Wilf enjoying a bath in a puddle the other day, near his HQ, in the centre of the village. On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

His immediate task  The further easing of the lockdown in England without causing a surge in new cases.Ahead of the main act announcing something this week, Downing Street sent a warm-up man in the shape of Englandrsquos Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. On the dove-ish side of the lockdown easing debate, he was perhaps better placed than some to reassure the public that it would be safe to get back out there into pubs, restaurants, and schools.Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday was first to run the rule over the numbers with Mr Hancock. By presenter Sophy Ridgersquos reckoning, the contact tracers were only reaching two people a week.: Revolutionary vision for post-Covid ScotlandFar from being a sign of failure, said the Minister, this was a good thing. It showed there was spare capacity in the system, and that was because the number of new cases was falling.So to the much hyped app, meant to be the jewel at the centre of what the PM promised would be a ldquoworld-beating system of track and trace. With the failure of the Isle of Wight trial and still no date as to when the software will appear, the app has become a Bennettian ldquochip in the sugar, a sign of standards not being met and promises unfulfilled.Asked when the app would be ready, Mr Hancock said he was not going to put a date on it . ldquoIrsquom highly confident it will happen, said the Minister. By the time he reached The Andrew Marr Show this had become ldquoWersquoll get there with the app.Nick Robinson was standing in for Andrew Marr, whose father has died. The Today presenter was among those who deputised for the Scot after his stroke in . Robinson would have found the format much the same: start with the papers, end with a Minister, and pause in the middle for something lighter, in this case interviews with Kristen Scott Thomas, who stars in one of the Talking Heads, ldquoThe Hand of God, and Nicholas Hytner, who directs three of them.One major change Robinson could not have predicted are the by now regular slots on Marr for experts. Both Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UKrsquos National Statistician, and Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stressed that coronavirus had not gone away and there was no room for complacency.Professor Piot, described in his introduction as something of a star in the fight against viruses ndash the ldquoMick Jagger of microbes someone had called him ndash said he would be okay with a relaxation of the two metre rule as long as masks were worn in public places. He also called the quarantining of people entering the UK ldquouseless and urged the UK Government to appoint a Covid- tsar at Cabinet level.: Former FMslates blended learningIn all his answers he was as clear as day, unlike Mr Hancock who had to do the usual thankless ministerial task of talking about a subject while not giving anything away before the official announcement.In lieu of detail Mr Hancock had come bearing a new word: ldquomitigations. Besides mask wearing this appeared to include adopting the New Zealand system of asking people for contact information when they go to a pub or restaurant. Expect ldquosign here for a pint headlines in England.Robinson was not going to let Mr Hancock go without bringing up the Ministerrsquos breach of the social distancing rules, as caught on camera last week when he patted a colleague on the back in the Commons. ldquoIt was just totally natural, said Mr Hancock. ldquoThis shows how dficult social distancing is. All I can do is say Irsquom incredibly sorry for this momentary breach. Itrsquos because Irsquom human. Wersquore all human.

Nor was he keen to share his thoughts on extending the furlough in Scotland save for telling the Scottish Government to be ldquomore ambitious on reviving the economy.ldquoAll yoursquore doing is telling us things we already know, said Brewer.

It was her proud claim that not one of her children left without being able to read and write. Coincidentally, it seemed that the majority of them wanted to learn, teachers and parents were respected and discipline was applied rigorously, despite the widespread poverty.I find it dficult to understand why, in our modern system of free education, more and more children seem to prefer to roam the streets, rather than apply themselves to learning the basic Rs. Interestingly, the children of immigrants seem to appreciate this more than our home-grown lot.I wonder why this would be Carol MacDonald, Troon.POLITICIANS and high-ranking civil servants behind the decision for \"blended\" schooling, aka part-time school, are largely cushioned from the consequences of their decisions: they dont have to choose between working and educating their children at home because they have jobs where they can be flexible about hours, can afford for their partners not to work full-time, can afford private tutors or to send their children to private schools whichthey are not offering full-time schooling in August will still be offering much more than state schools.But it isnt just the children of politicians and high-ranking civil servants who are protected from the consequences of their decisions about lockdown.

Does anybody knowthis theory is correct Elizabeth Mueller, Glasgow G.I HAVE for some years now realised the Ayrshire tattie problem and have resorted to growing my own.First, I threw two bags of sand on my Carse of Gowrie garden to give it an identity crisis and make it think it was on the Girvan shore, I then planted Epicure seed potatoes.What I am now enjoying, this week, tastes much as I remember from my childhood in Wigtownshire.Ethel Fitzgerald, Longforgan.Living with the beastsAFTER  years living on Skye, my view of a couple of the things referred to as becirctes noires by R Russell Smithndash midges and cleggs ndash changed drastically from when I first moved, to live surrounded by them.Walking to the shore below my home and often up onto the dun, gave great pleasure as I saw otters, hares, eagles, larks, eider ducks, voles, indeed all manner of creatures. I felt delighted whenever I saw them, had their company. Especially the moths, owls and snipe in the still nights.Gnat-bites, tick-bites and clegg-bites  I had thousands of them , but they are all part of evolution, the normal world, they have their niches as do humans and I learned to thole them. It is actually cruel noisy humans who are my becirctes noires, who often harm or scare away the other quieter creatures. We should learn to be silent and still at times, then otters and other animals would not be afraid to be near to us.Thelma Edwards, Kelso.Character referenceTHERE was a hidden bonus in your Those were the days feature on Monday .

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If itrsquos signicantly busier than we expect, wersquove got to be ready for that too.

The auld yins used the on-course site while the large overflow parking space easily accommodated the youngsters.Hand sanitising gel dispensers were installed and made available outside the clubhouse which like all others in the land is closed for business for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, although our clubhouse generates a decent amount of money from sales of teas, coffees, confectioneries but most importantly club logo-ed items of clothing we will not suffer quite as much as the larger clubs who maintain essential bars and restaurants.On the actual playing surfaces greenkeepers were required to make provision for golfers to be able to #hole# their golf balls without requiring to touch either the cup, the flag or the pin.Creativity came to the fore and what would our fellow dream up for our edication and delight #

Not kings or queens but rather those who weren#t the heirs to vast riches.Those whose only inheritance was that which they tried to carve out of a political system that railed against them.It is our inheritance as Republicans to end the oppression immortalised in these street names and statues.It is our duty to end colonialism, to end the normalisation of imperialism and, consequently, the political and economic system that maintains it.Belfast Most ReadBelfast home designed by Mater Hospital architect goes on market for £.mMurdered Glenn Quinn#s final call for help: UDA victim phoned brother in dying momentsBelfast streets #renamed# as part of republican campaignCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death as First Minister Foster hints at social distancing changeBobby Storey: Hated by the RUC, Sinn Fein figure was the hardest of IRA hardmen,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But, for now, all that has stopped.Fans of the local game have been left scratching their heads wondering what to do with their Saturday afternoons since the game came to a halt in March due to Covid-, never mind trying to wrap their minds around the proposals to bring back the action. Whether the club you love often basks in the glory of lting the Gibson or Irish Cups, or you trod home thinking what might have been, the Irish League is like no other in terms of the friendships forged on those Saturday afternoons.Certainly, some of the best memories this reporter has made in his  years is sharing Glenavon#s Irish Cup wins in ,  and  with his family. Who knowsthe Irish Cup will finish at all this season, but fans will not be able to share that special cup-winning feeling with the players, their friends and their families.Four Irish League fans who miss their weekend football fix spoke to the Belfast , looking back at those Saturday afternoons that feel so long ago and discussed what they are doing now to try and fill that void.Cltonville supporter Brian Smyth , Glentoran man David Kerr , Newry City fanatic Laura Hillenand Lurgan Blues fan Michael Scottwere all in agreement - it is not just the football, but the social aspect of our local game that has been missed over the last three months.Brian, a Green Party councillor in Belfast, described following his beloved Reds as an outlet and misses the unique quirks of the Irish League.If you#re invested in it, it#s family, he said. Your family is a bit of a melt sometimes, but that#s what the Irish League is, it#s your family.You miss it. You miss the characters and there is a social aspect to the Irish League. We don#t go there for sexy football. Sexy football comes along once in a generation for most teams, like Cltonville from  to  with Liam Boyce and Joe Gormley.You go along because it#s an extension of your family and you#re invested in it and you love it.I#ve been keeping myself busy with my council stuff, but I miss football. I#m a Manchester United man as well and a mate of mine said that the matches are back, but football isn#t, as the fans aren#t there.Michael was forced to watch old football fixtures on TV and YouTube at the beginning of lockdown.Like all those dedicated to following their team home and away every Saturday afternoon Michael, who is the editor of the Ulster Gazette in Armagh, has been totally knocked out of his weekend routine. I found that really, really hard. I missed that routine of getting up on a Saturday, going to the match, seeing my mates, have the craic, maybe stay on for a wee while afterwards and then come home, he said.I#ve been going out for a walk on Saturday afternoons, and like everybody  I ended up painting the fence. There was wee jobs in the house you end up doing.I miss meeting up with my mates. Saturday would be the day I would see a lot of people that I hang about with.You do miss that and obviously going to match might lead to staying on and getting a couple of pints or going round to a mate#s house for a pizza or a bite to eat. My routine on a Saturday now is basically get up and sit in a dferent room to the one I work in.Meanwhile, David#s Saturday afternoons at The Oval consisted of working with Glentoran#s media team, but all that has changed since Covid- struck.Focusing on nostalgic periods in the Glens# history during lockdown, David has been trying to bring a bit of Irish League football back into people#s lives through the club#s social media channels.You don#t have that usual routine of getting up, seeing what your mates and family are doing and heading to the ground, he explained.It#s the wee things you miss. I drive down and see that green mecca of mine that#s The Oval, so you miss that. You miss the smells, the taste of the burger and maybe getting a drink after the game.I think whether you#re a fan of Warrenpoint, Institute, Linfield, Glenavon, Cltonville or whoever, you all still have that same social side and I think that#s a massive part that everybody is missing and can#t wait to get back to.My job is trying to bring people closer to the club and Irish League football, so I guess I miss going out and speaking to people to create content.David added that no matter what your day job is, everyone who attends the game is the same when the referee blows the whistle at pm.Newry City#s Press officer Laura has even started supporting Hertha Berlin with their blue and white striped kit after the Bundesliga was the first major league toto screens.Her weekly routine consisted of attending committee meetings on Mondays, watching the players train on Tuesday, the under- games on Friday and seeing the first team play in the Championship on a Saturday.Going from that to nothing at all has been particularly tough.I would go to the matches with my sister and my daddy, she said. We all support Newry, so you#re getting to spend time with your family as well. My mummy is sick of the sight of us.Supporting local football is a great way to be part of the community and make friends.A large amount of our support would be the older generation and aren#t into social media, so without face-to-face contact they have no link to the club, so I#m sure as hard as it is for me, it#s harder for them.During this break we have launched a #KeepYourHeadUp campaign, getting videos from people from all over the sporting community - even a referee - to promote positive mental health and to keep your head up until we are back together again. Hopefully that#s sooner rather than later.Irish League football can generate a lot of negativity, mainly from those who don#t watch the local game, be it through the perceived quality of football or attendances, but Brian feels that is what makes our league.You even miss the games where there#s just  fans or less, he added. You can hear everything and the stuff coming out of people, which can be slightly outrageous, but it#s in your head for the rest of the week and it gets you through.I#m missing the routine, I#m missing the familiarity and I#m missing the social aspect. I think my we would prefer me going to watch a match.It is now up to the powers that be to get the ball rolling again, whenever that may be...

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

From  July, people who are shielding will be able to meet up to sixpeople outside the home, as long as social distancing is strictly observed. In addition, people who are shielding and living alone will be able to form a support bubble from July  with one other household. These easements are based on the continuing reduction in the rate of community transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland. Further details will be provided in writing to people who are shielding. This letter will also set out plans to put shielding on hold from  July. googletag.cmd.push Minister Swann said:“I have no doubt that shielding has played a key role in saving many lives. It has undoubtedly been extremely dficult for those who are shielding. I have listened with great sympathy to what people have told us about feeling isolated and how they have missed their loved ones. “I know these easements that take effect on  July will be welcome news to many as we move towards the pause in shielding from the end of July. “However, I am also very conscious that there will be some who are apprehensive about this change. I would therefore, once again, repeat my call to everyone to continue to observe social distancing and to be considerate of the fact that the people you meet may have been shielding for many weeks.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister added that people who are shielding must strictly follow public health advice on social distancing and hand washing. “While the risk of being infected has reduced, the virus still constitutes a serious threat to those who are shielding should they get it. “It is important to remember that because of your underlying condition, Covid- will remain a threat to you. At the same time, it is accepted that shielding has been really challenging and that being stuck indoors indefinitely is bad for mental and physical health. What we all have to do in these dficult times is try to strike the right balance. “This is about minimising any risk as much as possible, being aware that all contacts with the outside world must be managed really carefully. “Keep your distance, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, avoid touching hard surfacesyou are out. Wherever possible, avoid enclosed spaces where social distancing is hard to maintain – such as public transport and shops.” The easements in shielding guidance from  July were agreed at today’s Executive meeting. This includes meeting up to six people outside the home providing social distancing is strictly observed. People who are shielding alone can form a support bubble with one other household. Social distancing is not required with this other household. This will allow people to visit, stay over and spend more time with the second household. The second household can be of any size. Both households should not be part of more than one bubble and should continue to socially distance outside the bubble.

The RQIA – Northern Ireland’s health and social care regulator – was directed by the Department in March to reduce the frequency of its statutory inspection activity and cease its non-statutory inspection activity and review programme. This temporary measure was introduced to minimise the risk of health and social care professionals and other visitors spreading infection within care homes. Similar restrictions were introduced in GB and the Republic of Ireland. With community transmission of Covid- now signicantly reduced, the Department has been able to rescind the March direction. googletag.cmd.push With the rebuilding of health and social care services under way following the first wave of the Covid- pandemic, the RQIA will be able to increase its activity across all areas of work. It is important that this increased activity remains as safe and as flexible as possible. Returning to pre-pandemic inspection levels will not be immediately possible. Whilst RQIA’s planned inspection programme was temporarily paused, RQIA’s inspectors – including registered nurses, social workers and pharmacists – continued to regulate services and respond to risks and concerns. It reports that since the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, it conducted around  on-site inspections at care homes and domiciliary care services. It has also taken enforcement action against five services during this time. googletag.cmd.push In recognition of the threat from Coronavirus to older and vulnerable people, the Department of Health also “repurposed” RQIA from March to provide enhanced support to care homes and domiciliary care services. In response, the regulator established a Service Support Team.This has involved RQIA inspectors and senior staff providing detailed advice and direction to care homes and domiciliary care services in managing their services during the pandemic period.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Following a request from the Irish Central Border Area Network , the NIAO report will also look at the process used by BT for upgrading its own infrastructure. Mid Ulster District Councillor Sean McPeake said it was a positive development. “I have been supportive of the group’s request for an NIAO report to ensure future transparency around the lack of competition for Broadband infrastructure in the North,” he said. “The report is being currently compiled and crucially includes areas such as the process used by BT for upgrading their own infrastructure. googletag.cmd.push “I am confident that any positive recommendations which emulate from the report will be taken on board by Dept of Economy prior to the awarding of Project Stratum delivery contracts. “This is crucially required for the equitable roll-out of such a major broadband scheme that will have such major implications for future generations of rural people.” poundm of funding has been secured for Project Stratum, which aims to improve broadband connectivity at approximately , premises. There has been some criticism of theof time it will take to complete the improvements, with no upgrade work planned before the delivery of the project. googletag.cmd.push “Full delivery could take another - years, which does not address present needs,” said Cllr McPeake. “Rural areas such as Mid-Ulster need to have immediate interventions in broadband improvements to remain economically competitive and meet the needs of local homeowners. “Broadband availability has become a service utility which is equally essential as water, electricity or any telecommunications. “In recent months I have been inundated from constituents who cannot access sufficient broadband speeds for home-working, home-schooling or basic socialising. “Small to medium sized businesses are also struggling to achieve adequate speeds to operate their businesses in rural areas.” The Carntogher councillor has asked residents to detail their experiences in order to help with the evidence gathering process. “An integral part of the NIAO reporting evidence gathering process is having anecdotal evidence of the challenges of home working or home schooling during the ongoing public health crisis. “I would encourage anyone who is experiencing dficulties with Broadband provision during the COVID- Pandemic to email their experiences toinfo@icban.

Pretty Single brought togethersix gorgeous single women who agreed to be stripped of their make-up before going on a series of blind dates. googletag.cmd.push  Patricia won the public over on the show with her bubbly personality and natural good looks and although she didnt manage to find love she says she has found friends for le. I still chat to my final two fellas on the show but its on a friendship basis, she said. I did go on a second and thirddate with Martin the barber, but I realised we are more like friends. I talk to the girls every single day though. Theres notmany times you get a group of girls togetherand everyone justgets on so well. Everybody is buying each othercards and presents on their birthdays- its lovely. googletag.cmd.push Since taking part in the show, Patricia has embraced a more natural look. I think Ive found lovely new friends and Ive found myself too, she said. I havent worn make-up in three weeks. I wouldnthave gone out the door before without running a make-up brushover my face. Itwas just the norm, like brushing my teeth. So its been very liberating. Earlier this month, Patriciafulfilled her lelong dream of launching her own hair care products, which are named Glam after her salon in Waterloo Street. It features two luxurious ranges SOS and Peyton, named after her  -year-old daughter. I started hairdressing at  and after Peyton was born working and being successfulwas all for her, she explained. I wanted her to be proud. Patricia was able to use lockdown to put the finishing touches to the range and she is delighted with the finished products. Getting to make the products was so educational but there was so much work involved in it, she admitted. Im so thankful that I had that time to properly work on it because I never thought it would be that stressful. I was nervous about it, but I have learnt to trust in myself. My clients trust that when I bring out a product I will have trialled it and tested it on myself and I have been doing hairdressing so long that I know what works.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were many:ldquoMay you always walk in sunshineSlumber warm when night winds blowMay you always live with laughterFor a smile becomes you soThis article was first published on the CricketEurope website as part of a series paying tribute to those who have made signicant contributions to Irish cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Traffic calming measures are needed at Castlewellan road  ","story":"TWO local Sinn Fein representatives have voiced their concern over speeding traffic on a Castlewellan road.MLA Emma Rogan and Cllr Roacuteisiacuten Howell say residents in the Burrenwood Road area have contacted them over the speed of some of the vehicles.However, they are both disappointed with the responsive their queries received from the Department of Infrastructure.Cllr Howell said that while the road met the criteria for traffic calming measures to be introduced and had been earmarked as a priority, the Department was unable to carry out the work at present.She remarked: ldquoWhile both myself and the local community welcome that Burrenwood Road has been recognised as a priority, it is extremely frustrating that due to an oversubscribed waiting list the work will not be carried out.ldquoItrsquos very annoying for us to hear the road now meets criteria but wonrsquot be completed due to it not sitting high enough on a waiting list.Cllr Howell added: ldquoThis is a disappointing response and I understand the frustration of residents.Ms Rogan said she would be contacting the Infrastructure minister to ascertain when the work will be carried out.She added: ldquoThe safety of pedestrians especially young children must be paramount..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Virtual meeting to support businesses affected by virus  ","story":"PLANS have been unveiled for a virtual meeting to help businesses across the district which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor are organising a so-called lsquotown hallrsquo event designed to offer solutions for business operations post Covid-.The event mdash which takes place next Wednesday evening on Zoom at pm ndash will feature expert advice from a number of leading figures from the business world.They include Glyn Roberts of Retail Northern Ireland and Colin Neill of Hospitality NI, who will be joined by Tourism NIrsquos chief executive, John McGrillen.Mr McGrath and Cllr Trainor want as many businesses as possible to join the June  video conference event and ask the questions that matter to them.The Assemblyman believes that itrsquos incumbent on politicians, Northern Ireland Executive ministers and MPs to fight for businesses and help develop strategies that will benefit them post-coronavirus.ldquoNext weekrsquos virtual meeting is deigned to provide these businesses with key advice so that when they all reopen, they will continue providing the first class service they have been offering, in some instances, for decades, said Mr McGrath.ldquoI have been working with our local council SDLP team in establishing a video conference call with expert figures from this sector.Mr McGrath said next weekrsquos event will outline his partyrsquos plans for how it will work with local business as everyone prepares to exit lockdown.He added: ldquoI would encourage as many businesses as possible to get in touch and wersquoll get you connected with this quickly evolving network of local business support and advice.Cllr Trainor said while the financial support offered by the NI Executive to many businesses to help them cope with the challenges of coronavirus was welcome, his party was keen to explore what would happen post Covid- and what support would be required.He added: As a result of the initial shock and upheaval caused by the pandemic, businesses have lost a great deal and some have had to shut up shop entirely.ldquoThere is much fear and concern over what will happen to the businesses that are still operating, in particular, those in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11491149.jpg","title":"government plan give drivers   switch electric car","story":"How will it work What would the scheme achieve This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

Thatrsquos why we took the decision to bring back all of the beer from the on-trade. vw,vw,px, px\"Aidan Crowe, director of operations at the St Jamesrsquos Gate brewery He added: ldquoBasically what we do is we take all the keg beer back and we decant it and we disperse the product through a number of environmentally sustainable routes.ldquoThe vast majority of the beer goes to willow and Christmas tree plantations, itrsquos used as nutrients in those farms.ldquoWersquove also erted some product through to anaerobic digesters, where it produces a bio-gas.ldquoActually, wersquore quite optimistic that, in the long term, that bio-gas can be a suitable fuel source for us to use here in the brewery.ldquoAnd then wersquove also erted some of the product for composting.ldquoSo itrsquos an unprecedented problem for us to have and we wanted to ensure that in terms of how we manage that and manage the beer it was environmentally sustainable, because thatrsquos so critically important, not just for our business, but obviously for the country as a whole as well. vw,vw,px, px\"Brewing team member Steve Gilson checks on the progress of a tank of Guinness at the St Jamesrsquos Gate brewery Asked how many litres had been ed, Mr Crowe said: ldquoYoursquod probably make me cryI started to add it all up, but itrsquos hundreds of thousands of kegs and wersquove still got some products to decant and wersquove still got some markets that havenrsquot finished ing their beer to us. So a lot of beer and a lot of kegs.The main brew house at St Jamesrsquos Gate produces . million hectolitresa year.That amounts to  pints a second all year round.Ordinarily, St Jamesrsquos brews . million pints of Guinness every day and . million pints of other beer and stout.But all that was scaled back in the last two weeks of March and first week of April.ldquoOur biggest job really over that period of time was just managing what was an unprecedented downturn, said Mr Crowe.ldquoProbably going back to , actually, is the last time we had such a dramatic short-term change.ldquoNow, thankfully, wersquore on the other side of that, wersquore ramping up very, very strongly through the months of June and July. vw,vw,px, px\"Kegs of Guinness stacked ready for distribution at the St Jamesrsquos Gate brewery St Jamesrsquos Gatersquos three largest markets are Great Britain, Ireland and North America but overall it distributes to  countries worldwide.All stout, beer and ale produced at the height of lockdown was used only for canned products.So while the kegging operation at St Jamesrsquos Gate ground to a near halt, canning and bottle operations in Belfast and Runcorn actually stepped up production, to meet the added demand from the off-sales trade.Mr Crowe said the biggest challenge the brewery now faces is the uncertainty about what demand will look like in the first few months of eased restrictions.ldquoWersquove got to be prepared for dferent eventualities, he said.ldquoIf itrsquos slower than we expect, wersquove got to be ready for that. If itrsquos signicantly busier than we expect, wersquove got to be ready for that too.

Craigavon Borough Council’s Ulster Unionist grouping will meet today to discuss a range of matters including the name of a new £ million leisurecentre.By The NewsroomMonday, nd June , : pm\"\"A perspective of the new South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon.The meeting of the UUP council group is, the Local Democracry Reporting Service understands, due to take place at pm, just over two hours before Council’s monthly meeting at which the DUP will present a controversial proposal to name the South Lake Leisure Centre ‘Centinary Leisure Centre’.The proposal looks certain to ide the chamber and due to the make up of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, the Ulster Unionist Party’s vote will be crucial to its success or failure.SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson has called on the UUP to vote against it and described the move as “nothing more than a political stunt”.“The proposal will be taken by the Catholic Nationalist community as another insult by the DUP group on Council as it continues to try and drag us back to the ‘Ballygobackwards’ days of Craigavon Council,” said Councillor Nelson.“It is a slap in the face to nationalist people and I would urge the Ulster Unionist Party to stand up and be counted.”The Alliance Party has also come out in opposition to the proposal, with party group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson concerned such a move would require an equality impact assessment.“Any change at this late stage would mean further delay to the opening of the centre and additional cost to ratepayers as an Equality Impact Assessment would have to be satisfied, signage replaced at a potential cost of more than £k and planning implications would have to be considered,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We may even find ourselves in a position where residents are left without leisure provision altogether for an extended period.”He continued: “The centenary of Northern Ireland is a signicant event in our shared history, and of course it is right that we mark it in a thoughtful, inclusive and informative way.“Now, more than ever, people want to see their councillors showing leadership, working together and focused on the ongoing pandemic.“Engaging in political point-scoring or afaux fight over the name of a leisure centre ismerely a distraction from that.”Speaking last week, DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said of the proposal: “Our country celebrates a great milestone on May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom.“Given the current economic situation, we, as a party, discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary, so we will propose that the Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.”A decision on the proposal will be taken at tonight’s full meeting of Armagh City, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council.Sinn Fein was asked for comment.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most

Road users are advised to allow extra time for their journey and to follow the alternative routes which will be clearly signed on the approaches to the closure.Completion of the work by  July is dependent on weather conditions being favourable.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1592493837675.jpg--health_minister_issues_shielding_advice.jpg?159249383700","title":"health minister issues shielding advice ","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acccdbabcfcafdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecbcabbafcdce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
