[{"url":null,"title":"Storm early jabs young","story":"Share this articleMr Hancock said there were now 2,323 confirmed cases of the Indian variant in the UK – with the total having doubled in a week. Some 483 were in Bolton, Blackburn and nearby Darwen, but 86 local authorities have now reported five or more cases.Bolton has seen 19 people hospitalised with B1617.2, while Blackburn has eight patients with the strain. NHS data suggests the variant has not had a damaging effect on older residents, who are more likely to be vaccinated.Professor Adam Finn of the JCVI said he understood calls to inoculate younger age groups, but stressed there were still uncertainties over how well the vaccines interrupt transmission. Furthermore, given the lag between receiving a first dose and when its protection kicks in, he warned that changes made now would make little difference in the next fortnight.\u0027We do need to think strategically about what we do... over the next two weeks right around the country, in order to minimise the chances of this new variant causing a very major third wave,\u0027 he told Sky News.Government adviser Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, or Nervtag, said we should vaccinate people as \u0027fast as possible\u0027, including under-18s. He told the BBC that if supply was limited, it should not be taken away from more vulnerable people, but added: \u0027In Bolton, it looks like the cases are growing, particularly in those under the age of 45 – in other words, those who have not been vaccinated.\u0027It does look like we need to roll out the vaccines as fast as possible, and to extend down into the younger age groups who are being infected by this new variant, even those under the age of 18 and in the age range of people still at school.\u0027No 10 said the vaccine supply \u0027remains limited, as it has throughout this process\u0027, but added: \u0027There are no specific supply issues.\u0027Of the 56,992,075 jabs given in the UK as of Sunday, 36,704,672 were first doses – a rise of 131,318 on the previous day. There were 20,287,403 second doses, up by 183,745.The OxfordAstraZeneca jab could be between 10 and 15 per cent less effective against the new strain, it was reported last night.ITV\u0027s political editor Robert Peston claimed preliminary data from Oxford researchers showed the jab did not combat the Indian variant as well as Pfizer\u0027s or Moderna\u0027s."},{"url":null,"title":"Ex Navy officer says UFO technology 100 1 000 years ahead United States","story":"Retired US Navy Chief explains tech witnessed in UFO aircraft sighting - CNN Video"},{"url":null,"title":"The Bezos Jeff Bezos Amazon thinking buying MGM movie studio James Bond","story":"Share this articleAmazon Pondering Deal to Buy MGM — The InformationAmazon spent $11 billion on video and music content last year"},{"url":null,"title":"Starmer Sir Keir talks documentary life charge Labour","story":"Share this article It also showed his director of communications, Seumas Milne, accusing Labour staffers of leaking Mr Corbyn\u0027s briefing notes for Prime Minister\u0027s Questions to the Tories. It was filmed by Vice News and covered local elections last month, preparations for Commons performances and the reaction to the early stages of the anti-Semitism scandal that rocked the Labour Party and eventually led to his suspension from the party last year.Sir Keir last night faced his MPs in the wake of the party\u0027s disappointing election results.

While Vodafone swung back to the black last year, reporting profits of €536m compared to a loss of €455m in 2019, the result was at the lowest end of the company’s guidance and disappointed City expectations. “People being less ‘mobile’ in general is bad news for mobile telecoms groups like Vodafone,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Investors were also unhappy at an increase in annual capital expenditure, up from €7.85m to €8bn, which will hit its free cash flow.  Nick Read, Vodafone chief executive, said the investment in 5G and broadband infrastructure would pay off over the longer term. “The world has changed,” said Nick Read, Chief executive at Vodafone.  The 97k increase in payrolls is also a seasonally adjusted figure, to give a better picture of the labour market]. This chart from ING also shows the recovery in admin and support payrolls: The number of adults seeking work fell to 1.6 million in the three months to March, compared with 1.7 million in the three months to February, the Office for National Statistics said. According to the latest snapshot, the number of employees on company payrolls rose for the fifth consecutive month, but remained 772,000 below pre-pandemic levels, in a sign of the progress still to be made. The biggest falls in employment came in the hospitality sector among those under 25, and among those living in London. Early indicators show the number of job vacancies continued to rise into April as non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality reopened in England and Wales, with most industries displaying growth, most notably in the accommodation and food service sectors. However, the number of roles on offer remains below pre-pandemic levels, with arts, entertainment and recreation, and the hospitality sector worst affected. Here’s the full story. The rebound in job adverts in some of the hardest-hit sectors suggests the increase in the jobless rate may be fairly short-lived, he adds: Of course, this is all dependent on the path of the pandemic, and whether the UK is able to exit the crisis - or if new variants force new restrictions to be imposed. George Eustice, the environment secretary, has confirmed this morning that local lockdowns might be needed if the situation were to deteriorate in some areas. Our UK Covid liveblog has more details: But Resolution also warn that there’s an employment gap of over 4 million jobs to fill. That’s made up of the fall in payrolled employees (down 772,000) and self-employed workers (270,000) since February 2020, along with the estimated 3.1 million workers still on furlough. Hannah Slaughter, economist at the Resolution Foundation, explains: It highlights how younger people have been particularly affected by the pandemic, with fewer opportunities for work during the lockdown (with bars and restaurants shuttered until last month, and only serving inside since yesterday). Over the last quarter there was a decrease in the employment and unemployment rates for young people, particularly amongst 16- to 17-year-olds, the ONS says: Eleanor Harrison OBE, chief executive at youth charity Impetus, says the government must extend its support for young people:  The number of people out of work for at least a year rose to 381,236 in January-March, up from 299,109 a year ago. The number of people unemployed for between 6 and 12 months has risen too, and more sharply, to over 375,314, from over 205,523 in Q1 2020. This rise in longer-term unemployment shows the long-term damage caused by the pandemic, explains Institute for Employment Studies director Tony Wilson: Overall, the number of people classed as unemployed fell by 121,000 in January-March (from 1.744m to 1.623m). The employment total rose by around 83,000 (the first increase since the coronavirus crisis began).There were around 153,000 redundancies in the first quarter of 2021, down sharply on the 343,000 recorded in October-December. That pulls the redundancy rate down to its lowest in eight months: Redundancies hit record levels last autumn, as struggling firms cut staff before the government extended its furlough scheme in a late u-turn...however, that’s partly because the pandemic hit lower-paid workers harder. As more lost their jobs, or were furloughed, a ‘compositional effect’ pushed up average pay levels. The ONS reports that most industries advertised more jobs, with accommodation and food service activities more active (in preparation for the relaxing of restrictions in April, and again yesterday). It estimates there were 657,000 job vacancies in February-April. That’s the highest since the first quarter of 2020, just before the first lockdown. And in April alone, vacancies rose near to their pre-pandemic levels (according to ONS experimental data, and online jobs site Adzuna). The ONS estimates that 97,000 more people were in payrolled employment last month, compared with March. That’s the fifth monthly increase in a row. However, company payrolls are still 772,000 below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, with young people - and those in the hospitality sector - worst hit by the job losses. Britain’s unemployment rate has fallen, in a sign that the labour market may be recovering as the economy emerges from the Covid-19 lockdown. But, unemployment is still 0.8 percentage points higher than in December-February 2020, reflecting the economic damage caused by Covid-19. Total hours worked also fell, due to the pandemic restrictions. The ONS says there are ‘signs of recovery’. More details and reaction to follow.....

He says some people had been more vaccine hesitant than others. But the numbers were going up across all groups, he said. He said he would encourage everyone to get vaccinated. Asked how he would respond to people who say unlocking should not be delayed because some people are not willing to get vaccinated, he said the government was continuing to monitor the data and that it would continue to keep people informed. But Sky’s economics and data editor, Ed Conway, has been looking at the government’s own figures for the positivity rates for people arriving in the UK from those three countries in late March and early April, and they show that what Hancock said was wrong. People arriving from Pakistan were not three times as likely to test positive as people arriving from India. And people arriving from Bangladesh were actually less likely to test positive, he says. Conway explains in his story: The Department of Health has not yet explained this discrepancy, but we may get some sort of response from the Downing Street lobby briefing. According to PA Media, the latest figures mean 152,919 deaths have now occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. PA says the highest number of deaths to occur on a single day was 1,477 on 19 January. During the first wave of the virus, the daily death toll peaked at 1,461 deaths on 8 April 2020.This morning Zubaida Haque, the former deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality thinktank, and a member of Independent Sage, the independent expert group that makes Covid policy recommendations, claimed vaccine hesitancy was being used as a “red herring” by the government. She told Good Morning Britain: Haque said people should get vaccinated. But she said that it would take another two months before all adults were vaccinated, that the government had to set the right policy now, and that this week’s easing of lockdown restrictions should have been delayed. She also said that it was a mistake to blame people for vaccine hesitancy. She said: The FT says that ultimately the issue will have to be decided by Boris Johnson - and that neither the Truss camp nor the Eustice camp know which side he favours. Head also said it was important for people to understand how transmissible the Indian variant was.  But Head also said that she was “confident” that the vaccines were still effective against the Indian variant because most of the new cases in the town were in people aged under 40. “We have seen a small uptick in our inpatient numbers at the hospital, but nothing that makes me feel like we are not seeing a vaccine that is effective,” she said. As PA Media reports, Bedford’s Covid rate jumped from 61.2 cases in the week up to 6 May to 123.5 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 13 May. It is only behind Bolton in Greater Manchester, which continues to have the highest rate in England, with 811 new cases recorded in the seven days to 13 May. The figures have been calculated by PA news based on Public Health England data published on May 17 on the government’s coronavirus dashboard. This morning Qureshi’s argument has been endorsed Prof Kevin Fenton, the London regional director for Public Health England. He told the Today programme: George Eustice, the environment secretary, was speaking for the government on the morning news programmes, and he confirmed that local lockdowns might be needed if the situation were to deteriorate in some areas. He told Times Radio: Here is the agenda for the day. 12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Penny Mordaunt, the Cabinet Office minister, responds to a Labour urgent question about enforcement of the ministerial code. 2pm: Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee. 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon is due to be reconfirmed in the Scottish parliament as Scotland’s first minister. 4pm: Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, gives evidence to the Lords European affairs committee.

Photograph: Gerard McCarthyWhile wellbeing is the new buzzword in the school curriculum, many educators feel the key to positive mental health is something which has been with us all along.“I would see nature as being the real mindful education,” says Dr Paddy Madden, Heritage in School specialist, former primary school teacher and college of education lecturer.“Whether you’re are listening to birds, smelling the flowers or gardening you are in the now and whatever big worry was weighing down on you dissipates, being in nature melts down the worries.”Madden says teachers play a key role in creating opportunities for children to notice nature. “Forget about the objectives, forget about the assessment, just get them to notice. Noticing nature a few times during the week has a huge effect on their mental wellbeing.”To this end, we’ve collected some of the best nature-based resources available to schools which may help you to see that sometimes the grass is greener in your own school garden.Engage with Nature engagewithnature.ieThis website offers resources for teachers and children that help promote a sustainable environment, while also encouraging positive climate action and improving personal wellbeing.It contains month-by-month instructions for schools wishing to create a school garden. There are explanatory videos and downloadable materials for teachers including how to make a cultivation bed, measure a tree or make a scarecrow.The website also provides hands-on activities for children to do at home with a parent or . Activities range from how to grow seedlings to growing carrots in a dustbin. Each activity is paired with a video explainer.Niall Hatch of Birdwatch Ireland has been visiting schools and delivering workshops for nearly 15 years.“When I go to schools, they tend to know a lot more about the wildlife of sub-Saharan Africa or the Amazon rainforest than they do about the wildlife of their own county and I think that that is a real shame,” says Hatch. “They tend to think of nature as something very far away, something you only experience as a special treat.”Hatch says it is important that children learn about local wildlife so they can see how it relates to their own lives. “People won’t want to protect the things that they don’t understand.”The Birdwatch Ireland website has a series of downloadable lesson plans and teaching materials for schools. It also offers talks to schools where possible and hopes to provide more workshops for teachers in the future.“We have learned that while there is certainly a benefit to going in and giving a talk to schools, what is better, sometimes, is to educate the educators so that nature isn’t seen as a half hour break once a year but is something that goes through the ethos of the whole school,” says Hatch.“A lot of research has been done into what has been termed ‘nature-deficit disorder’,” he adds. “There are strong mental-health benefits from immersion in nature. Especially with Covid and all that is going on, immersion on nature can really help.”This international initiative aims to foster an interest in nature and the conservation of migratory birds in children. They can post their first sightings of birds such as the swift and the cuckoo to the website.“We are asking people to help us track migratory birds mainly so that we can work out what the average date would be each year for the arrival of these species, not necessarily what the earliest one is but when the bulk of them are coming because that tells us a lot about climate change,” says Hatch.The website, designed to appeal to children, contains bird fact-files along with images and species related migration information.The children can also watch videos and live streams via Bird TV and the Spring Alive YouTube page.The children will find tips on how to build a nest box, how to feed the birds when there is a food shortage and advice on how to become a good birdwatcher.Zoologist Mairéad Stack is running a series on webinars for third to sixth class primary school students for the month of May.“I am going to be showing them how to make some nature crafts and talking to them about what they can do for wildlife because quite often they are watching videos about the Amazon but in Ireland we have wildlife and we have wildlife around your school,” says Stack. Children will learn how to identify tracks left by local wildlife such as foxes.The webinars will also help students identify what they can do in their own garden. “Can you build a little log pile in the corner of your garden which might be used by hedgehogs to snuggle in underneath or put up two different kinds of bird feeders, one that a robin might like and one that a goldfinch might like?” says Stack. “Really simple stuff but really good practical actions for wildlife.”Webinars run every Thursday in May at 9:30am.This website has a section for schools containing downloadable materials on pollination. The Junior Pollinator Plan explains what pollination is, why it is important and what schools can do to help. The school section of the website has short videos and fun animations for the students to watch.There are a series of 10 lesson plans. Each lesson has learning objectives and all necessary information compiled for teachers to use. They come with suggested activities based on class level and ability.“The All Ireland Pollinator Plan has done a magnificent job of providing resources to schools and communities,” says Stack. “It has made massive difference in terms of providing resources to teachers, literally giving them the information which has been lacking up until now.”The nature tableThe nature table that once held pride of place in every primary school has been uprooted in recent years – but many are reintroducing it back into its educational habitat.“I learned my nature in primary school through a nature table,” says Madden. “It was interactive, we brought in stuff every day, the teacher spent half an hour each day on what we found.”Madden says this empowered them as young learners because they were leading the learning.“We loved that time of day and that is what got me into nature and that what was landed me into my career.”Madden says the table should be interactive and reflect the seasons and should be changed weekly.This solutions-focused climate action programme aims to not only provide students with practical hands-on tasks that enable them to be proactive in their approach to climate action but it also aims to reduce the anxiety many students feel around climate change.“Fear does not kindle creativity, guilt does not inspire new ideas, and anxiety does not drive action. We need to give our students a sense of hope, a feeling of ownership, and the promise of immediate tangible results. We want to give students the tools to help rewrite their future, and the future of the planet,” says Vicki Brown, chief executive of Cool Planet Experience.The Rewrite Climate programme, currently aimed at transition-year students, has 12 climate change lessons on topics such as transport, energy, sustainable fashion and food.The school grounds“We are very fortunate in our school that we have a beautiful school garden and a green-fingered caretaker, the beauty of the on-site garden being its accessibility,” says Niamh Egan, primary school teacher at St Canice’s boys school in Finglas, Dublin.Teachers have been using the garden area for social skills lessons as well as promoting nurturing and co-operative behaviours.“The digging, planting and watering have great benefits for students’ fine and gross motor skills. Children have a natural affinity to nature and a school garden, or even a few raised beds, can really create a fantastic learning environment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Solar, wind and nuclear are building blocks towards target, says International Energy AgencyMike Hayes: Companies who embrace low carbon technologies will be the winnersThe Luggala Estate extends to more than 1,800 hectares and is one of Ireland\u0026rsquos most spectacular upland landscapes"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus 360 new cases reported as varadkar says august the earliest date for holidays abroad","story":"Mandatory hotel quarantine will also be with us in some form for some time to come, Mr Varadkar has said. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins There have been a further 360 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the State, the Department of Health has said. On Monday morning, there were 110 Covid positive patients in hospital, of whom 42 were in intensive care. The Department has not notified any further deaths of patients who tested positive for the virus since Friday, the same day that it emerged the department and HSE had been the target of a cyberattack.Elsewhere Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said it will be “August at the earliest” before non-essential international travel can take place again. “It’s against the law at moment to leave Ireland for non-essential reasons, but we will have to change that law at some point,” Mr Varadkar said at the virtual launch of Cllr James Geoghegan’s campaign as Fine Gael’s Dublin Bay South byelection candidate.He said 60 per cent of adults here have yet to be vaccinated and there are some new variants which “we’re concerned about”, meaning any reopening will be gradual and done in steps.“I think realistically it’s likely to be towards the end of the summer, August at the earliest, before we’re saying to people it’s ok to engage in non-essential international travel,” Mr Varadkar said.Mandatory hotel quarantine will also be with us in some form for some time to come, he said, as other countries’ vaccination rollouts lag behind ours, but there will be room to open travel between certain countries.“It is my fervent ambition that we will be able to restore the common travel area with Britain very soon, so people can travel without restrictions... we will be able to restore that at some stage this summer or Autumn.The EU Green Cert on travel is still in development and should be ready by the middle of June, he said, with countries then having six weeks to adopt it for use.The Tánaiste’s comments come as the National Immunisation Advisory Committee has confirmed the age limit for the AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccines is being reduced from 50 to 40 years, with people aged in their 40s being given a choice.Niac, which made recommendations to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan over the weekend, considered the administration of the two vaccines to people in their forties “with some conditions attached,” he said.Dr Holohan is understood to have endorsed Niac’s recommendation in his recommendation to Government. The HSE has now been asked how to operationalise the proposals.Sources said that implementing the advice will be “tricky” as it is not clear whether the information on risks can be given through existing frameworks and structures in the vaccination programme, or if they will need to be modified. Other aspects, such as whether the conditions attached complicate plans to roll out the vaccine through community pharmacies, also need to be examined.The recommended conditions would include ensuring people have full information about any potential risks and ensuring the two vaccines could be administered to younger people at a quicker pace than the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said.People who decline to accept AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson will be offered mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) as supplies come available."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

The survey also found that employees prefer remote working more than managers and team leaders.The study, carried out by NUI Galway, revealed that among those who could work remotely, 95 per cent were in favour of working from home on an ongoing basis. A total of 53 per cent said they would like to work remotely several times a week, 32 per cent said they would like to work fully remotely and one in ten said they would like to work from home several times a month. This is the second such survey of its kind, and the number of people who said they would like to work fully remotely has increased substantially from the first national survey conducted in April 2020, rising from 12 per cent to 32 per cent.The number of people wishing to engage in some form of remote working also increased compared to last year’s survey, up from 83 per cent to 95 per cent. The study also revealed that close to one in 10 people have already relocated or moved house, as working from home gave them more options.Almost one in five of respondents said they would consider relocating based on their experience of remote working since Covid-19. A further 9 per cent said they had already moved. The most popular relocation destinations were in the West (Galway, Mayo, Roscommon), the South-west (Cork and Kerry) and the Border region (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo).Fourteen per cent said they may consider moving, while just over half (53 per cent) said they would not consider relocating.According to the survey, the top three advantages of working remotely given by respondents were: greater flexibility, the belief that ‘life is made easier’, and an increase in productivity. However, more than half of respondents said that they work more hours when they work remotely.The study also revealed that managers felt differently to their employees when it came to remote working. Forty four per cent of managers said it was more difficult to manage their team remotely, and 12 per cent of managers believe that remote working negatively impacted their team’s productivity.Forty seven per cent of managers said they found no difference between managing their team remotely compared to onsite.In relation to worker productivity, 44 per cent of team managers believed that remote working positively impacts the productivity of their team, and the same proportion (44 per cent) believe that remote working makes no difference to the team’s productivity.Three-quarters of the organisations that were surveyed had not decided how their teams will work once the pandemic ends. Of the 25 per cent who had decided, 78 per cent will work to a hybrid model. The study also found that 45 per cent of team managers believed they did not get the training required to manage their team remotely.The survey was led by the Whitaker Institute at NUI Galway and the Western Development Commission, and it is the second annual national remote working survey in Ireland. The survey gathered responses from more than 6,400 employees and more than 2,100 managers.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nama close to approving sale of dublin apartments to uk based fund","story":"The Casino development in Malahide, Co Dublin. Photograph: The CasinoThe State’s National Asset Management Agency (Nama) is close to signing off on the bulk sale of 69 apartments in Malahide, Co Dublin, to a UK-based investment fund.A deal has been reached in principle to sell the apartments at The Casino development in Malahide village to SeaPoint Capital, a serial block-buyer of apartments for the rental market.Some 34 apartments in the complex were sold to private buyers for an average price of €433,000 over the past 2½ years. Nama is selling the remaining unsold apartments in bulk. SeaPoint is the preferred bidder. The apartments are part of the properties owned by Gerry Gannon, one of the most prolific property developers of the boom-time era, whose loans were sold to Nama. The average market value of the remaining properties in the Malahide development is between €400,000 and €450,000, valuing the deal at up to €31 million.SeaPoint’s Dublin-based chief executive Kieran Gilmartin said he wasn’t in a position to comment.A spokesman for Nama also declined to comment. The State agency, set up in the wake of the financial crash, is legally obliged to secure the best price for properties in the recovery of loans.The Labour spokeswoman on housing, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, said proposals being considered by Cabinet today to ringfence a percentage of newly built homes for first-time buyers should be extended to encourage more apartments to be sold to owner-occupiers. She called on Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien to introduce stamp duty changes to make it less financially attractive for investment funds to buy apartments here, warning of an “oligopoly” in the rental market.“The Minister should ask Nama to step in and not to sign off on a sale like this,” she said.Attracted into the market by high rents, SeaPoint has been buying up large numbers of apartments in recent years, including in Dublin city centre, Blanchardstown and Tallaght.

Photograph: SeongJoon ChoBloomberg.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said he is hopeful that the economy “can return to something close to normality by late summer”.In an opening statement to the Oireachtas committee on enterprise and employment ahead of an appearance on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said the Government’s National Economic Recovery Plan - due to be completed within the next fortnight - would outline “targeted assistance for sectors which will continue to be most adversely affected by the pandemic”.He said this would set out the next steps for emergency pandemic interventions such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and reaffirm the Government’s commitment to avoiding a cliff-edge ending for the supports.However, Mr Varadkar also warns that the payments, which have cost billions to date, “cannot continue indefinitely”.Mr Varadkar, the Minister for Enterprise, said the plan would set out the Government’s ambition “not just to return to the pre-pandemic Ireland, but to build a better ‘normal’ - a more inclusive society that is equipped to meet head on the twin challenges of digital and green”.The Fine Gael leader said the official advice remained that employees should work from home where possible. VentilationHe said he had last week published updated guidance on ventilation and on rapid antigen testing with an aim of reducing “the spread of Covid in the workplace and help people get back to work and businesses to open and stay open”.“It gives clear information on how to use antigen testing appropriately in the workplace. It sets out that these tests should be used as an additional health and safety measure and not as a substitute for any other precautions.”Mr Varadkar said employers should also consider how they can improve ventilation in workplaces. “Even simple actions like airing rooms or keeping a window open can make a difference,” he said. “Although we intend to vaccinate the vast majority of the adult population by the end of June, the reality is some people can’t or won’t take one. Vaccination is and will remain voluntary so it’s important that employers have guidance on how to manage any unvaccinated workers.”Separately Mr Varadkar told the committee that “appropriate training, competence, on-going de-briefing and supervision within a well-established safe and healthy system of work” should be available to content moderators who seek to prevent the wider distribution of explicit and harmful content online.Concerns He said in February he had met a group of content moderators and their representatives and afterwards had written to Facebook “setting out the concerns raised at the meeting”.“All employers, no matter what sector they are in, have a duty of care towards employees to ensure that a safe working environment is created. This includes the management of workplace stressors or psycho-social hazards,” he said.He said appropriate training must be provided and employers must carry out a risk assessment with a particular focus on potential hazards in relation to content moderation work.

That is exactly how it should be. As an organisation funded by compulsory licence fee, the BBC must not allow its employees to “speak in their own voice” on controversial subjects. If they wish to speak out, that is perfectly understandable, but they must follow the logic of their position and leave the BBC. It is as simple as that. The fact that Mr Marr feels this frustration is a small sign that perhaps, under the new director-general, Tim Davie, the corporation is paying more than lip service to its key founding principle.As for Mr Marr, if he feels so unhappy, he should join us columnists in the Wild West world of opinion. It is much more fun than the Beeb and he would be a glittering addition to our number.The BBC still has a long way to go, however, along the road back to impartiality. Its coverage of the latest Israel-Palestinian confrontation and the anti-Israel protests in London at the weekend present a case in point. Here there is no overt opinion-mongering as, say, that of Emily Maitlis against Dominic Cummings. Instead, there is a way of framing the issue: Israel is in the dock and Palestinian violence is treated as almost incidental. The BBC’s Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, retweeted the headline of an article which read, “Racism, hate and violence are Jewish values too”. Bowen added: “Every Jew, and every gentile should read this.”During the weekend protests, a small convoy of cars carrying Palestinian flags was filmed driving through St John’s Wood in London. Their crew shouted obscene anti-Semitic abuse through a loudhailer, demanding that Jewish girls be raped.The BBC reported this, after it had been condemned by the Prime Minister. The reporting was calm which, even in such horrible cases, it should be. Imagine how different it would have been, though, if the men with the loudhailers had been white fascists, let alone if they had been shouting similar slogans against Muslim women. All hell would have broken loose. The BBC would have led its news with the incident, and thrown detachment to the winds. The BBC never explains what Hamas, Israel’s antagonist, believes. The Hamas Charter is explicitly anti-Semitic. It speaks of the “Nazism” of the Jews and says “the Day of Judgment will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them) until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: 0 Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!”Firing rockets from Gaza, which it controls, Hamas is working as hard as it can to kill Jews, telling Muslims that killing is their religious duty. Our media should explain that the foul-mouthed anti-Semites in St John’s Wood are not weird outliers: they are doing pretty much what their leaders tell them.People are a bit puzzled about what “levelling up” is. Given the desire of voters in places like Hartlepool for it to happen, urgent answers are needed.I think I have hit on one. Abolish the insistence on a university degree for any job in the public service, perhaps for any job at all. The professions will say they need people with well-trained minds to become doctors, barristers, investment bankers and top-grade civil servants. They do. But what makes them think they will necessarily find more such minds emerging from our bloated university system than from graduates of the “University of Life”, whom they could train themselves?Nowadays, policing and nursing are graduate professions, with the result that they disdain the bits the public most value and make entry from poorer areas harder. Even those wandering the richest “olive groves of academe” are not necessarily the better for it. Three years of anti-Brexit prejudice and “decolonising” curricula at Russell Group universities (plus debts of £30,000) may instil lasting bitterness and render alumni unfit for useful employment. Of course, people should go to university if they want to. But why should jobs be specially reserved for them?The Government is planning appropriate recognition for iniduals who have performed heroically in the Covid crisis once the “war” is over. That is right, but there is a case for collective recognition too.Consider the volunteers without whom the mass vaccination centres could not operate. As well as visiting for my own jabs, I have attended three other times with family or neighbours who need assistance, and witnessed the benefits. We, the public, have been put at ease by friendly volunteers (of most ages and both sexes) who register everyone and radiate the sense that they are doing a happy thing. They give a reassuringly local feeling to the place and let the doctors concentrate on the medical work unimpeded. As one GP puts it to me: “Apart from being helpful, they’re invisible.” He means that as high praise.The general good effect is what matters. Thousands – round us, roughly 20 per centre per day – are prepared to turn up unpaid, often in bad weather and with some small risk of infection, helping people who may be frail, frightened or confused.

Each time the Government needs to scare the public into submission, a new mutation pops up and chastens anyone considering reclaiming their pre-lockdown life.Last week, Boris Johnson warned that the Indian variant could mean some hard choices which might see the full release of lockdown pushed back beyond June 21.Undoubtedly, cases of this latest mutated virus are on the rise. It is now the dominant strain in some areas. Yet there is currently no evidence to suggest any of the variants will evade the vaccine programme, or that a new rise in cases will lead to an increase in hospital admissions or deaths.This pattern has now been playing out for several months, and curiously emerged just as the public was starting to seriously question apocalyptic modelling predictions stating that deaths would rise to 4,000 a day.It began in mid-December, when Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, told the Commons that more than 1,000 cases of the Kent variant had been found in 60 local authorities, largely in the south of England. It coincided with a spike in cases, with the variant quickly taking over from the Chinese wild-type which caused the first wave, leading Mr Johnson to cancel Christmas for many. By January, there was a countrywide lockdown. On Jan 4, the Prime Minister addressed the nation, warning that the variant was between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible.A few weeks later, on Jan 22, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said the Kent variant could be up to 30 per cent more deadly and suggested it may kill 13 or 14 of every 1,000 men over the age of 60 who caught it, compared to 10 in 1,000 of the old variant.  Dire warnings from Public Health England around that time suggested the variant had caused us to soar past the peak of the first wave. Yet the second wave always seemed worse because it occurred during the winter, when many people would ordinarily be expected to die. In fact, despite this terrifying new deadly variant, second wave levels never reached the excess deaths of the first wave. It later emerged the Kent variant was no more deadly, and that the vaccines worked very well against it. King\u0027s College estimated it was probably about 35 per cent more infectious – far lower than the public was originally told.Cases peaked in Britain on Jan 4, a day before lockdown was imposed. But as the vaccine programme picked up pace and infections, admissions and deaths started to fall substantially, suddenly the public was informed about a new variant threat.On Jan 25, Mr Hancock announced that dozens of cases of the South African variant had been found on British soil, and the strain was now classed as a variant of concern.In the weeks running up to the Government announcing its roadmap out of lockdown on Feb 22, press conferences were heavily dominated by concerns over variants and people were told that staying at home and following social distancing was the best way to tackle their emergence.When the roadmap was announced, the Government added variants into its test of whether restrictions could be lifted, saying the release could only go ahead if our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of concern. Being spooked by a variant was now grounds to withhold freedom.The week before schools and care homes were due back on March 9, Mr Hancock announced a third worrying variant, this time from Manaus in Brazil, which was thought to reinfect those who had already had Covid.So it was with a familiar sense of deja vu that the announcement of the latest release of restrictions on May 17 was accompanied by foreboding about the Indian variant. Again, we had warnings that it could be far more transmissible than even the Kent strain. It is now clear that neither the South African nor Brazilian variants ever achieved a large foothold in Britain, being consistently out-competed by the less deadly Kent strain.And there is currently no evidence to suggest the Indian variant is more lethal. In fact, Prof Sharon Peacock, of the University of Cambridge and Cog-UK which is monitoring variants for the Government, believes the current variant is outcompeting two other more dangerous versions from India. The vaccines have so far stood up to every variant thrown at them. The death rate for the Indian variant is far below the Kent variant, hospital admissions are not rising and the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. This is despite one of the coldest springs for decades, which has forced people indoors.Cases largely appear to be rising in areas of vaccine hesitancy, suggesting people who are avoiding the jab are placing themselves and their communities at risk. This weekend, Mr Hancock suggested the majority of people in hospital with the variant had refused the vaccine.Can the rest of the county really be expected to forgo freedom because others have decided to not take the protection offered? More recently, there has clearly been a tension in the Government between the optimistic tone of the Health Secretary, who is confident that his vaccine rollout can save the day, and the Prime Minister and scientists, who seem oddly fatalistic that the jabs may fail. If they do, we are out of options. Variant booster jabs will not be ready for many months, and the country cannot stay in lockdown indefinitely.We will only be able to test out hard-won vaccine resilience by unlocking. Nearly 70 per cent of the adult population of Britain has had at least one vaccine dose, meaning we are now safer than at any time through the pandemic.  We should not still be cowering behind restrictions and the threat of variants. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"holidays europe covid vaccine passport","story":"British holidaymakers are on Wednesday set to be given the green light by the EU to use vaccine passports to enter Europe.EU ambassadors are expected to sign off a plan allowing fully-vaccinated Britons to fly to Europe without having to have a Covid test or quarantine.It came as the bosses of BA and Heathrow issued a joint plea to the Government to publish an advance list of its green countries for the summer to enable families to plan holidays.Currently, all European countries bar green-listed Portugal and Gibraltar are rated amber by the Government, requiring travellers to quarantine and take two PCR tests on their return.  The EU plan would see member states adopt uniform entry requirements, giving fully-vaccinated holidaymakers from low-risk countries such as the UK unrestricted entry to Spain, France, Italy and other popular destinations.It would, however, create a system that would see the rest of the bloc accept passengers based on vaccination status while the UK confers no such status on those who have had the jab and instead requires testing or quarantine for all returning holidaymakers.On Monday, thousands of Britons flew to Portugal on holiday as the Government\u0027s travel ban was lifted under step three of its roadmap out of lockdown.Other holidaymakers defied government warnings that they should not travel to amber countries by flying to destinations such as Greece despite having to quarantine on their return.Sean Doyle, the chief executive of BA, and John Holland-Kaye, his Heathrow counterpart, warned that Britain\u0027s restricted green list meant it risked missing out on the opening of travel across Europe despite the success of its vaccination programme.They said many European nations including Spain, Greece, Cyprus, France and Malta were making tremendous progress in bringing down infection rates and boosting vaccination levels.We are calling on the Government to help people to plan ahead by publishing a list of countries expected to be on the \u0027green list\u0027 for the summer so that passengers are not faced with high prices and limited choices for last-minute bookings, said Mr Holland-Kaye.That\u0027s happened to many people travelling to Portugal today. Let\u0027s give hard-working Brits the chance to get their towels on the sun lounger.On Wednesday, the UK is expected to be included on an expanded EU green list permitting holiday travel from non-EU countries with Covid infection rates below 100 cases per 100,000 of the population rather than the current 25 per 100,000.EU ambassadors will meet to agree a European Commission proposal calling for travel restrictions on non-EU countries with high vaccination rates to be lifted. If the ambassadors reach agreement as expected, the decision will be formally adopted at the EU trade ministers council on Thursday.The bloc\u0027s green list is currently limited to seven of the lowest-risk countries including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore – but the UK, with 44 cases per 100,000 people, and the US, at 35 per 100,000, are now expected to make the cut.Member states will also be recommended to set up digital portals that will enable Britons to use the NHS app as a vaccine passport as the EU develops a similar green certificate for citizens. Those who are not vaccinated will have to present a negative Covid test or evidence of immunity.Portugal and Greece have already jumped the gun by opening to British holidaymakers, but the EU-wide move is designed to kickstart the summer holiday season for the whole continent and agree a united position.On Monday, the Government faced a backlash from Tory MPs and travel bosses  over its tough approach, particularly to amber countries. Last week, Boris Johnson warned that the current 12 countries and territories on the green list would not expand very rapidly when the list is reviewed in three weeks.Matt Hancock reiterated that holidaymakers should avoid travel to amber countries other than for exceptional reasons, even though it is legal to do so under the traffic light system.But Huw Merriman, the Tory chairman of the Commons transport committee, accused the Health Secretary of effectively turning the \u0027amber list\u0027 into the \u0027red list\u0027 and added: What is the point in me having my passport any more?Mr Doyle said he was surprised by Mr Hancock\u0027s excessive warning, while Johan Lundgren, the easyJet chief executive, said the latest data suggested most of Europe could actually already from right now go on to that \u0027green list\u0027 of categories.Paul Charles, the chief executive of The PC Agency, who led a Save our Summer campaign, said: The Europeans are just more optimistic than the UK. They realise how critical travel and tourism is to their economies so they are moving at great speed to introduce a more seamless approach to travel for the summer season.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid tier local lockdown plans","story":"NewsPubs and shops could shut as local lockdown plans drawn up amid Indian iant fearsThe Indian iant could force a comeback for Tier  stay-at-home rules in certain areas - with grants of up to £, for businesses hitmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video good-morning-britain-doctor-warns-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:GItQHTc,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Ministers are looking at a comeback for isive local lockdowns in England as areas like Bolton and Bedford battle the B... strain. According to The Times and Politico, there are three options for what happens on June , when it had been hoped all legal restrictions would end. Either it will go ahead as planned, or there will be local restrictions in some areas, or some June  easings will be delayed for the whole country. Regions could be thrown into a ‘Tier ’ system with pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops closed and a stay-at-home order, The Times reports. Businesses in areas slapped with restrictions would be able to claim grants of up to £, through their local council.  Alternatively, some or all of the changes slated for June  - including nightclubs reopening and an end to social distancing - could be delayed nationally. In this case, grants could be made available for the worst-hit sectors such as nightclubs and mass events like festivals, The Times said. One aide told ITV’s Robert Peston: ”It is clear some social distancing will have to be retained, not everything weaposve set out for  June is likely to happen”.  It comes after both Downing Street and Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out local lockdowns or a June  delay. The Indian iant is more transmissible, with more than , cases now detected in more than  council areas - up , in just four days. While it is not yet known to resist the vaccines, it is spreading fast - including among communities who had a low vaccine uptake.  Quizzed today on the reports, Cabinet minister George Eustice did not rule out the prospect of local restrictions in some areas after June . He told Sky News: ”That would be an option and we cannot rule anything out, obviously, at this stage. But our preferred outcome is that we really double down and get the vaccination rates up in those areas that are seeing these problems.” Mr Eustice told Times Radio intensive surveillance was being used in areas with high case rates but local restrictions remained a possibility. If we do have a deterioration in some of these areas then of course we canapost rule out that we would put in place certain local lockdowns, he added.  At the moment we are doing a lot of intensive surveillance in those areas, with surge testing to identy it and deal with it.England had three tiers with dferent rules for gatherings and pubs last year. But eventually Boris Johnson plunged the country into a month-long November lockdown anyway.When England emerged it struggled through a month on a new four-tier system before having to go into lockdown again. Bedfordaposs director of public health said she was really worried about the Indian iant after the area saw  confirmed cases. Vicky Head told BBC Breakfast she had seen “a really massive rise in cases”, adding: About three or four weeks ago we were having three or four cases a day. We are now up to  times that.  Saying “pretty much all” Bedford’s cases are the new iant, she added: “Thataposs one of the really striking things about the iant, is just how transmissible it is. If someone goes to school and tests positive, we are then seeing their whole family test positive. Any delay to the June  date, either nationally or regionally, would be a major blow for the already stricken hospitality sector. Businesses have warned they are only just able to break even again after being allowed to reopen indoors yesterday but with reduced capacity. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It is going to take at least three years for businesses toto pre-pandemic levels in terms of getting rid of loans, the debt, the rent arrears and the VAT holidays. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,viafouraComments:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mediaGridDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,smallerFloatParkVideo:true,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,emxDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,bundledCss:,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,tcfVersion:,codesplit:,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,ampQuantcastCMPEnabled:true,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,delayAdsUntilConsented:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,prebid.sendAllBids:true,loginRadius:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,prebid.sendHBKeys:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,enableUserProfile:true,improvedigitalDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,smartAdServerDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,verizonDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,jwplayer.float.mode.always:true,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableCallToActionBar:true,noticationTrayEnabled:true,richaudienceDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,apiCommentCountEnabled:true,swipeNavigation:true,fundingChoicesEnabled:true,customAdExperience:true,adFixedTopSlot:true,viafouraSectionUuid:----edc,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,prebidAds:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,video.jwplayer.rame.playerId:yozc,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,ixDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,commentCountEnabled:true,lotameMantisDisabled:,video.imaVersion:.,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,delayVideoAdsUntilConsented:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\" Even with yesterdayaposs easing of some restrictions businesses were operating at % as they had to provide a range of safety measures including one-way systems and table service.

Dr Zubaida Haque, a member of independent Sage, told Good Morning Britain that the Government should have stalled the lting of restrictions on Monday - which allowed hugging, indoor gatherings of up to six people, and overnight stays.

People hugging, mixing and laughing together is a welcome sign following months of barriers and we must thank the NHS for a wonderful mass vaccination programme. But the spread of a iant first detected in India is worrying, an avoidable danger intensied by another foolish mistake by a Prime Minister who delayed safeguarding our nation. When a big proportion of hospital cases in parts of North West England are patients who for whatever reason weren’t vaccinated when jabs are available, the link between personal protection and inoculation is clear. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Every one of us has a responsibility to be jabbed for our own sake and our families, neighbours, workmates and communities. Because those who put themselves and others at risk by refusing a jab without a good, evidence-based reason may pay a high price. End slaughter Every decent person in the world wants an end to the slaughter of Palestinians and Israelis in the protracted Middle East dispute and the same decent folk will condemn hatred in our own country. The shocking anti-Semitic attacks recorded in London, and any anti-Muslim abuse, are appalling and must be shown zero tolerance by the police and courts.  There is no excuse for vile racism which harms community relations and, it should be pointed out, harms the causes of those spewing the prejudice. We need to bring people together.

Boris Johnson and health experts have urged people to exercise caution amid concerns about the spread of the Indian iant. Although ministers believe the vaccines will be effective against the highly transmissible Indian iant of concern, there are worries about the impact of its spread on those who have refused to have a jab or not yet been offered one.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeDoctors made the decision not to resuscitate a man shortly before his death without consulting him or his relatives. The Do Not Resuscitateorder was placed on Brian Boultonaposs file the week before he died at the Royal Gwent Hospital on Wednesday September , . The form states that Brian, , has no known next of kin, despite his partner of  years Celia Jones having regularly visited him for hours on end at the Newport hospital in south Wales. Celia only learned of the DNR eight months after the death of Brian, who also had a brother. Following revelations that such orders were placed on Covid patients without the familyaposs approval, the -year-old has decided to bring Brianaposs story to light. What happened was so devastating and shocking, Celia told The Mirror. The DNR was totally secret. It was a catalogue of errors, bad communication and worse.  Before he fell ill with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in , Brian had been a fit man and played tennis to a competitive level. A year before he died he began suffering from the breathing condition, but made a full recovery for ten months before his ribs became painful. He had a CT scan in August  which revealed oesophageal cancer that had spread to lymph nodes. Had it been spotted it should have triggered an urgent cancer referral, an ombudsman later found, but it wasnapost and no referral was made. He was dead a month later, Celia said. They missed a tumour the size of a tennis ball. In the years following his death Celia has fought to uncover the circumstances surrounding Brianaposs death, including medication he was given on the day. Two hours before Brian died he received a dose fluphenazine in what an ombudsman concluded was a potential medical error. Experts cited in the same report concluded that the anti-psychotic drug, which lowers breathing rates, did not cause his death.  Dr Mark Burgin, a member of MEWA Medical and Forensic Expert Witness Services employed by Celia to look into the death, reached a dferent conclusion. None of these ‘experts’ appear to have considered that Fluphenazinea sedative and could have caused decreased respiration , he wrote. It is plausible that the death would have occurred over the next few weeks but is not likely based upon the evidence to have occurred on that day. Celia is also devastated that she was not able to be at her partneraposs bedside when he died, having received a call warning her he was dying ten minutes before he did. Nursing records show that his deterioration had been obvious to medics an hour before this. Months after Brianaposs death an ombudsman found issues with how the DNR order was placed on his file.  The record of the assessment of capacity within the clinical notes that informed the urgent DoLSauthorisation was extremely brief, the ombudsman wrote. Additionally, there was no care plan attached to the authorisation. As the health board did not carry out the full assessment of Mr Zaposscapacity at the earliest opportunity and did not involve those closest to him or appoint an IMCA, Mr Z did not have an independent voice in these very import and signicant decisions. On a DNACPR form filled in by a medic it states Brian does not have capacity to make decisions about CPR and that we have no record of next of kin or power of attorneys. Celia has struggled to come to terms with the fact the order was issued without her consultation. They have to discuss it with family or the patient, she said. I have never in my le, I was a nurse, I have never seen such poor care in my le. At the time I was absolutely stunned. I donapost think Iaposve had time to grieve.Celia is speaking about Brianaposs death after it came to light that hundreds of Covid patients had been issued with DNRs without them or their loved ones being told. The DNR orders – which mean that le-saving resuscitation will not be attempted – were put in place for  care home residents during the Covid- crisis. But the Care Campaign for the Vulnerable says the number, revealed in a Care Quality Commission report, is just the tip of the iceberg. A spokeswoman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said: “We have offered our apologies to Ms Jones and we are very sorry for those elements of her late partner’s care which fell below the expected standard, despite the best efforts of our staff.Our thoughts remain with his family and friends.We have already fully co-operated with a Public Services Ombudsman for Wales’ Office inquiry and provided information to aid their independent investigation.We accepted the recommendations outlined in the Ombudsman’s report, a number of which we have already addressed in response to the original complaint from Ms Jones in .As a Health Board, we are fully committed to learning and making improvements to the care that we provide, including improving the experience for patients and their families.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNewport CorporationHospitals"},{"url":null,"title":"fans joke mum 22 sue","story":"NewsFans joke mum-of- Sue Radford is planning another baby after huge jacuzzi postBritains biggest family the Radfords posted an image to their hundreds of thousand of Instagram followers of a large jacuzzi bath they were considering buyingmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsNoel and Sue Radford live in Lancashire with  of their  children \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Julie Forward, , had several phone consultation with her GP during lockdown and was repeatedly prescribed antacid remedies. But the pain in her left side continued to get worse and she kept trying for a face-to-face appointment, reports HullLive. She then finally saw a hospital consultant for a surgical biopsy after several months of persistence - who found a ruptured bowel. Julie was told the problem had been caused by a cancerous mass pressing down, and she had the beginnings of sepsis. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  She was eventually diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and immediately started on chemotherapy. It was  weeks before Julie, who ran a holiday park before her illness, left the hospital after her consultation. She said: I first started feeling poorly last summer. I noticed I was getting weak and couldnapost do the things that I normally did. I used to go running with my dog but I suddenly couldnapost run with him anymore as I was in pain under my left bust. I thought to myself aposIaposm struggling to walk here and I used to runapos. I also couldnapost lay down on my left side, so I started trying to see the doctor. She had several telephone appointments and said she made countless more attempts to see her GP at Clton Medical Centre in Hull. I kept getting told to take Buscopan and Gaviscon and peppermint tablets, Julie said. After months without investigations, where she was only prescribed indigestion remedies, Julie was finally booked to have an endoscope procedure in January this year after a stool sample showed traces of blood and a blood test found she was anaemic. But the camera investigation did not show anything untoward. She said nothing further was done to investigate the blood in her stool or the cause of her anaemia. By this time Julie grew so weak she was hardly able to walk.  She attended an appointment at Hull Royal Infirmary in February this year, in an unrelated matter because of existing polyps, and while she was at the appointment, she asked the sonographer carrying out the ultrasound to look at her left side, where she had the pain. I could tell from her face sheaposd seen something, said Julie, from Hull. She then received an appointment to see a specialist later that month to have a surgical biopsy. But, the night before she was due to go, she took a turn for the worse and was laid on her bed shaking from head to toe. I felt like I was dying, she said. But I didnapost want to call an ambulance as I knew I was going to hospital the next day. When she arrived at hospital the following day she said the the consultant took one look at her and said she wouldnapost be going home that night. When she was opened up in theatre that night, surgeons found a mass which had grown and put pressure on the small bowel, which had then ruptured, and sepsis was already setting in. It was a good job I had that appointment. I had to have my bowel repaired, she said. I woke up the next day and had two drains coming out of my stomach. The doctors told my husband thatit ruptured again they wouldnapost be able to bring me back round. I was nil by mouth for six weeks. I was told I might not make it. It wasnapost the lymphoma that nearly killed me, it was my bowel rupturing. My surgeon said he didnapost think I was going to make it. You donapost last long with a ruptured bowel. Julie was discharged  weeks later.

She said she has now dropped from ten stone to seven stone nine pounds, the chemo made her lose her hair, and she is still unable to eat properly as a result of the bowel repair. She says she feels lucky to be alive, but she is also heartbroken at the toll the illness has taken on her and husband Dean. My husband at one stage told the doctor apossheaposs dyingapos and heaposs been through hell seeing me like this, she said. I used to be as fit as a fiddle. I used to run three times a week. Now, I donapost know how Iaposm going to be from one day to the next, and everything is an effort. Julie, who has two children and three grandchildren, has now had five rounds of chemotherapy and has one final round left, before she will be scanned to seeshe can be given the all-clear. She said she doesnapost intend to sue her doctor, and she credits the NHS surgeon with saving her le, but she said she wishes that she had undergone more thorough testing at an earlier stage. She said: It could have all been avoided. I was curled up in a chair for weeks and weeks. I just wonderour lives will ever go back to what they were. It has had a massive impact on me mentally. We just feel like it has completely changed our lives. A spokesperson for NHS Hull Clinical Commissioning Group said: We are sorry to hear about Ms Mercer’sexperience of care. The Clinical Commissioning Group is keen to help investigate this on her behalf and we have already flagged it with her practice for their attention.

It comes after the Duke of Sussex criticised his father last week, saying Charles suffered during his childhood, and “treated me the way he was treated”. Speaking about his upbringing as a royal, Harry told Dax Shepard his father passed on genetic pain and talked about how he wants to break that cycle. It is a far cry from the relationship the dad and son appeared to have when they chatted on BBC Radio aposs Today show back in . During that broadcast, Harry enthused: We could talk about this for hours and hours, which we always do, but not with a microphone in front of us.  I totally see it and I totally understand it because of all these years and conversations weaposve been having. I do end up picking your brains more now than I ever have done. The Prince of Wales referred to his son as dear boy, adding: Well darling boy it makes me very proud to think you understand. On his aposArmchair Expertapos podcast Harry appeared to have changed his tune. He said: When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, Iaposm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on.  Itaposs a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway, so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say aposyou know what, that happened to me, Iaposm going to make sure that doesnapost happen to youapos. Harry said that, as he grew older, he realised Charles was raising him in the same way he had been raised himself, and he wanted to change that for his own children. In a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year, the Duke of Sussex said there was a aposlot of hurtapos between him and his father. Their relationship reportedly soured to the extent Prince Charles had stopped taking his sonaposs calls following Harry and Meghanaposs decision to step away from royal duties.  Speaking to aposCharles  Harry: Father and Son Dividedapos producers, royal author Tom Quinn said: There is no doubt the gulf between Harry and Charles had widened considerably. I mean I thinkthey are not careful it will be very dficult to bridge that ide in future I canapost see how they can do it. Grant Harrold, ex-butler to Prince Charles, William and Harry also told the documentary: The damage is done. And that makes me sad because the relationship that I knew which was a loving, caring, fun relationship can never be like that again.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal FamilyParenting"},{"url":null,"title":"indian variant hotspot seeing whole","story":"NewsWhole families suffer from Indian iant after one child gets Covid at schoolVicky Head, the director of public health in Bedford, has said she is \"really worried\" about the local increases in cases, which has seen the borough surge to have the second-highest rate in EnglandmirrorShareCommentsByLuke PowellJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsA marshal on patrol in Covid-hit Bedford \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The director of public health in Bedford has said she is really worried about the local increases in cases.Vicky Head said infections in the borough had jumped from three or four a day to up to  times that figure over the past month. Bedford has the second-highest rate of coronavirus in England, with  new cases recorded in the seven days to May .Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Ms Head said there had been  confirmed cases of the Indian iant recorded locally. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.  And she warned that the new strain was highly transmissible. Ms Head said: What we know is what weaposve been seeing locally, which is a really massive rise in cases. About three or four weeks ago we were having three or four cases a day. We are now up to  times that.She added: What we think now is that pretty much all of our cases are likely to be the iant from India.Ms Head said a surge in Covid- testing was being planned for parts of the borough to identy those who have the virus, but are not showing symptoms, and to ensure they self-isolate.Askedshe was worried about the spread of the iant, Ms Head said: I am really worried about it.  Everyone needs to understand just how transmissible this iant is. Thataposs one of the really striking things about the iant, is just how transmissible it is. If someone goes to school and tests positive, we are then seeing their whole family test positive.Bedfordaposs Covid- rate jumped from . cases in the week up to May  to . per , people in the seven days to May . It is only behind Bolton in Greater Manchester, which continues to have the highest rate in England, with  new cases recorded in the seven days to May .The figures have been calculated by the PA news agency based on Public Health England data published on May  on the Governmentaposs coronavirus dashboard. Ms Head said she remained confident in the vaccine programme as most of the new cases in Bedford were recorded in those aged under . She added: We have seen a small uptick in our inpatient numbers at the hospital, but nothing that makes me feel like we are not seeing a vaccine that is effective.But the fast-spreading Indian iant has arrived as restrictions are being eased, and when the number of infections may have increased anyway, a scientist said on Tuesday. Steven Riley, a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: The timing of the iant is bad in some ways because it is happening as we are trying to open up and taking a signicant step in relaxation. It is good in other ways because we are at very low levels of infections, cases and hospitalisations. This is the point in the road map where we would have expected perhaps an increase in infections anyway. I think that most people would be expecting an increase, it is just the degree of the increase. Prof Riley said people need to get vaccinated in case there is another wave of infection and that so far the evidence is that the vaccine is still effective against this strain of the virus. Laboratory studies are under way that will give more information and time is needed to observe the virus in the population, he added.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHospitalsCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"it turns out im really","story":"AdvertorialIt turns out I’m really good at it - man turns health challenges into sport and TV successHow actor Ekow Otoo went from a teenager facing a debilitating condition to a lead role in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV admirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialThanks to CGI, Ekow is transported into the middle of a Viking invasion in The National Lottery adImagine being a ft in, -year-old man and finding two pizzas too heavy to carry, but not knowing why. That was what happened to Ekow Otoo – an actor, spoken-word poet and model. “My legs had been giving me problems for years I was suffering a relapse and felt too weak to cook, so I’d ordered a takeaway. I remember being pinned to the wall when I took the pizzas from the delivery guy – they were too heavy to walk with,” says Ghanian-born Londoner Ekow, now . Ekow, who now knows he has multiple sclerosis , started experiencing issues aged . “I tried to get out of my bed one morning and my legs wouldn’t follow. After a nap they were fine again, but next time I played basketball I couldn’t run – my knees would buckle and I couldn’t get any speed.” A GP put the issue down to Ekow shooting up six inches in just one year. “They just thought I’d grown too quickly and my muscles were catching up.” MS is an inflammatory disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. Slowly the disease affected Ekow to the point he had to give up sport entirely. “I couldn’t even walk two roads without resting on walls.” At university Ekow struggled to get information from his brain to the page. “I think they thought I was lazy,” he says. “I didn’t connect the problem with my legs, though.”  Help and advice In February , Ekow went to bed with a chest infection. “When I woke I felt funny, sat down and couldn’t stand up again. I ended up in hospital with a doctor standing over my bed, saying: ‘This is MS.’ I remember thinking, ‘Wow, there’s a name for it.’ “It was such a relief to have a definitive diagnosis. I knew it wasn’t all in my head.” When he was first given his wheelchair, Ekow was, “overcome with peace”: “I thought it was going to be a massive struggle, but I sat in the chair and pushed for the first time, and it was like all the stress melted away. “It turns out I’m really good at it. I can travel faster than I used to, without worrying I’ll fall over, look strange or have to stop.” Since his diagnosis, Ekow has relied heavily on The National Lottery-supported MS Society which proved a vital source of information and help when he needed it. He has also benefited from sports, including wheelchair racing – mentored by Paralympian Vanessa Wallace – and adapted rowing with another National Lottery-supported organisation, British Rowing. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week* “Getting back into sport was the first step in finding my confidence as a wheelchair user. I just loved it – I took part in a development programme with British Rowing for a year and, in , won a para-rowing gold in the British Championships.” Ekow has even excelled at acting, and was recently picked to play the lead role in a stunning new National Lottery TV advert, which sees him performing dramatic stunts in his wheelchair.  Thanks to some clever CGI, viewers watch as he is transported from a street corner into the middle of a Viking invasion, before tearing through a museum and then taking off above the city skyline. At one point Ekow is even flung into the air as he travels through a skate park. All the situations in the advert show the kind of fantastic projects those who play The National Lottery are helping to fund – from community sports to keeping our beaches clean and safe, bringing history to le in museums and helping people explore the great outdoors.By playing The National Lottery, you raise £M for good causes every week*.

I’d rather wait to seevaccines really are safe. What’s wrong with that  Covid- vaccines were tested extensively before they went into general use.  Subsequent data from their widespread use in the UK and other countries in many millions of people show that all the vaccines are very safe and that serious side effects are very rare. If you delay getting vaccinated, you are at risk of getting infected and also put at the risk the people you are in contact with. Other people need a vaccine more than me. Isn’t it OK to let others have theirs first   People are prioritised for vaccination based on factors such as age and medical history. When you receive your invitation to be vaccinated, you are not disadvantaging anyone . Aren’t people dying from blood clots because of the vaccine  Reports of serious blood clots are very rare, with typically only a few cases per million doses of vaccine administered.  I don’t trust the Government, so why should I trust a vaccine they tell us to have  Covid- vaccines were tested rigorously before they were used in the general population. No short cuts were taken in this testing. The safety of the vaccines continues to be assessed continually.  The odds of me dying from Covid are so low I’d rather take the risk of not being vaccinated. Many people who survived a Covid- infection have been left with long-term complications such as heart and lung damage.  Vaccination reduces the risks of you suffering a serious illness, and also helps protect your elderly relatives and older work colleagues. Haven’t lots of people died after having their first Covid shot  Reports of people dying after their first Covid- vaccine are very rare. In most cases, death was due to natural causes and not linked to their vaccination. Can the Covid vaccine affect fertility  No, Covid- vaccines do not affect fertility. This vaccine was developed in record time. I’m worried they cut corners to get it out in such a rush. Vaccines were developed and tested in record time because of advances in medical technology in recent years and because bureaucratic obstacles to setting up research trials were minimised. No corners were cut in the development and testing processes. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. I’ve already had Covid so I don’t think I need a vaccine. Won’t I already have immunity  Natural immunity to Covid- can wear off and people can sometimes suffer a second infection. A vaccine boosts your immune response and gives you additional protection. Natural immunity to Covid- can wear off and people can sometimes suffer a second infection.

His tortured relationship with the role he was born into, from the bemused little boy who attended his first day at school in front of the press, to the lovable rogue who was happy to muck about for the cameras, has seen him face many struggles throughout the years. To many, it came as no surprise that he wanted out from The Firm. He’d long spoken to trusted friends about how he dreamed of walking away, perhaps not quite in the manner in which he eventually did so which continues to cause so much anguish for his family.  Over the last few months the wantaway Prince has taken to airing a series of grievances to favoured journalists and chat show hosts, while seemingly unaware his family can still hear him. Now the contradictions appear to be flowing thick and fast. Just days after comparing his le to The Truman Show film or akin to living in a zoo, he’s prepared to use his mother’s legacy to further his personal profile on the global stage. Quite how his family will feel, who he’s still not managed to secure a channel of communication with yet, only time will tell. Perhaps, some may argue, he is quite entitled to use his experiences to further his mental health crusade, as well as his new found profession as a film producer - Netflix have paid him a £million for the privilege after all. But purely examining his willingness to use his opening line to Oprah on the damage caused by derogatory mental health terms, while in the same breath this week labelling his adopted country’s First Amendment, the right to free speech, as “bonkers”, Harry may find the path to righteousness can be a bumpy one.

Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland became the latest nations to ease restrictions on foreign visitors who have had both doses. Vaccinated travellers will be able to enter the countries without having to do a PCR test or go into quarantine. Germany said yesterday it is even allowing people from higher risk amber nations and all will be exempt from having to self-isolate on arrival, while those requiring a test to enter will be given one for free. Spain and the Netherlands, meanwhile, are allowing anyone from countries with low infection rates and they donapost even have to prove vaccination status. The former is considering a  or  per , case rate threshold, while the later has set theirs at , which would include the UK. Switzerland is also dropping quarantine for jabbed people from safe countries.Have your holiday plans been affected by Covid  Let us know at webnews@mirror In contrast, Britain requires anyone from just  green-listed countries to take a test on or before the second day of arrival, eventheyaposve been vaccinated. Those include Portugal, Israel, Gibraltar and Iceland. It comes after Portugal announced Brits would be allowed to enter the country from Monday when the borders re-open following hours of uncertainty. Anyone coming to the UK from an amber listed country, which includes Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Holland, as well as France and Greece, must quarantine for  days and have two PCR tests after two and then eight days.  As such, the UK has been criticised for being too cautious, despite the threat being posed by the Indian iant. Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said tougher rules meant not only are Brits going to be beaten to the sun loungers by the Germans, Dutch and Swiss but this will leave them picking up a bigger bill for their holiday, coupled with an onerous, expensive and unnecessary testing regime for low-risk countries. We donapost want Britons to be left behind in the race to the sun when the huge success of our vaccination programme does mean travel can safely reopen, he added.  Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, said: The UK will rapidly fall behind the rest of Europe unless it looks again at its overly cautious approach to international travel. There is no reason why our green list canapost be expanded to include the US and the most popular European hotspots, or for the UK not to follow the EUaposs lead in exempting vaccinated travellers from restrictions. There are fears that the B.. strain will hinder the UKaposs pandemic recovery and could lead to the final lting of restrictions on June  being postponed. As experts say vaccines have saved , lives, a surge in cases in Bolton threatens to scupper progress.

Chris Gould, , and her twin sister Sam were left feeling invalidated after police said they would not be prosecuting in the wake of their abuse allegations, their parents said. An inquest last month heard that Sam Gould took her le in September , aged just . On Monday an inquest opened into the death of her twin sister, Chris, which heard that the -year-oldaposs body was found beside railway tracks near Teversham, Cambridgeshire, just four months later in January . Chris had previously disclosed that both she and her sister had been seriously sexually abused from a young age and into their teens, the hearing was told. No-one was ever charged despite a criminal investigation into the alleged abuse and the decision left both girls feeling aposinvalidated,apos the inquestat Huntingdon Town Hall, Cambridgeshire heard.Samaposs inquest last month heard that she had been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder which was related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood. The girlsapos parents Jane Cannon and Ian Gould told an inquest into Chrisaposs death they were not in any doubt the abuse happened – and that it was the root of Chris’ mental health problems. The parents, from Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, also said Chris found it incredibly dficult to spend time at the family home in the months after losing her twin. Mr Gould said: This was an extremely tragic situation in which Chris had decided to take her own le and go and be with her twin sister. Like anyone who has a sibling would understand, they were the best of friends and the worst of enemies - often at the same time. They were fiercely loyal to each other. They were the greatest supporters of one another when either was distressed. They could support each other in ways that no-one  could. The inquest heard that Chris first disclosed the alleged sexual abuse in June  - but that it had started from around . By the time the twins were around  years old, they had both begun to seriously struggle with their mental health, their mum said.Chris in particular was experiencing eating dficulties, self-harm, and having suicidal thoughts, Mrs Cannon told the hearing.She refused to talk about it, but we made her go to the school therapist, which she hated. The court heard Chris made her first suicide attempt in May  by attempting to take an overdose. It was also discovered she had been self-harming, which her mother later believed was relevant to her alleged abuse, she claims. Mrs Cannon said Chris was referred to the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services , where she was seen by a mental health practitioner. Chris disclosed the alleged sexual abuse on June ,  - and her mother said she was electively mute for a period of time afterwards. The inquest heard that Chris was put on anti-depressants in October , which lasted for a period of five months.But her mother said her behaviour deteriorated during this time, and she suffered from panic attacks. Another blow came for the family in December  - when they were told the police would not be prosecuting Chris and Sam’s alleged abuser. Mrs Cannon said said: You can imagine at that point the whole family had been on tenterhooks, wondering what would happen with the police inquiry, waiting and chasing for news - only to then find out that. It had a big impact on Chris - she felt invalidated and not believed. The inquest heard there was another serious event where Chris had attempted to take her own le at school - but had then changed her mind, the coroner said. This led to Chris being admitted as an informal patient at mental health clinic The Darwin Centre in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire. Chris remained as a flexible patient on the ward at The Darwin Centre until her death - particularly after losing her twin sister, when she struggled to spend time at her family home. On the evening Chris died she was let outside the ward for a cigarette - which was not allowed on the premises of the clinic due to an NHS smoking ban. The inquest heard Chris left the ward shortly after .pm - and at .pm, staff were aware she had not ed. Shortly after .pm, her boyfriend went to search down by the train tracks near Cherry Hinton - where he saw police and realised what had happened. Chris’ parents said their daughter had liked to walk along this route, and had written eloquently about it in her diary. The inquest heard Chris had grown increasingly frustrated with her inconsistent diagnosis in the months leading up to her death. The coroner heard that, at a meeting in December , Chris had said to one of her doctors: The trouble is, no-one knows whataposs wrong with me. Do I have borderline personality disorder or not  Her mother told the inquest: The random changes to her diagnosis had not gone unnoticed by Chris. She was getting as exasperated as we were by these inconsistent diagnoses. The inquest is ongoing and expected to continue until next week.If you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available   on  .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnNHSEducationSchoolsMental healthPanic attacksCrimePrescriptionsTwinsInquests"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather brits braced hail","story":"NewsUK weather: Brits braced for hail and thunder as forecasters warn torrential rain on wayWith more relentless downpours to come the washout spring of  could see the wettest May on record, beating  when .mm of rain fell across the UK.mirrorShareCommentsByTed HennesseyWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsThe month could become the wettest on record \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Itaposs in stark contrast to last yearaposs blistering sunshine that saw both the sunniest spring and driest May since records began. Met Office forecaster, Sarah Kent, said that changing climates make changeable conditions and weather extremes more likely. But she said it was too early to predictthis month will be the wettest May on record. Ms Kent said: Over the next few days, large parts of the UK will see showery conditions with occasional torrential downpours, thunderstorms and even hail. Drivers should be very careful as quite a bit of rainfall could lead to some problems on the roads. Iaposd say itaposs going to be very unsettled, as some areas will see some sunshine, and be relatively warm, while itaposll be chilly for those who see torrential rain. Parts of the country could see weather warnings imposed before heavy downpours and unseasonable gales move in from Thursday, the Met Office said. Those who are planning outdoor gatherings this week as coronavirus restrictions ease are being advised to think again due to signicant, windy weather as the result of a low pressure system over the UK.Temperatures in London and southern England will reach highs of C , while the mercury in Wales, Scotland and northern Ireland will hit C . However, a deep area of low pressure will hurtle in from the west on Thursday. Ms Kent added: Wednesday will be the most favourable day of the week, but will be a quiet lull before a potent low pressure system arrives from the Atlantic bringing with it unseasonably strong winds and severe gales.  Parts of the country could see weather warnings come in, as the winds and showers will hit large swathes of the country, particularly in western areas. Anyone planning outdoor gatherings should certainly keep an eye out for signicant, windy weather and be sure to monitor the Met Office website for any warnings. Five-day UK weather forecast Today: Starting mostly dry with sunny spells, but showers already in the southwest, developing more widely again, becoming heavy with risk of hail and thunder. Cloudy with rain or drizzle in the far north edging south into mainland Scotland. Tonight: Showers easing for many areas with clear spells developing, although further showers, some heavy in the south. Cloudier in the far north with rain at times. Wednesday: Heavy showers in south, developing again in other areas through the morning, but drier with more sunshine in southwest UK for the afternoon. Rain in central Scotland turning more showery. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Remaining very unsettled with some wet and very windy weather for many on Thursday and Friday, gales possible in the south.

Katie Grouse, , says she has lost money and missed out on eligibility for a government scheme helping people into homes due to the delay. She said her hopes of settling at the Harron Homesapos Oaklands Heath development in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, have been dashed.After deciding to buy a new home, she put down a deposit last August, sold and moved out of her old home, and exchanged contracts on a £, Harron home last December, Katie told Yorkshire Live.Have you got a housing story  Email webnews@mirror But just weeks into the new year her plans were in tatters after Harron Homes admitted it wasnapost going to be able to build her house in time for the Help To Buydeadline this February. Despite the government scheme being extended by at first one month and then three further months due to the pandemic, Harron Homes still said it would be unable to finish the home and that the sale was off. But Katie claims she has since found out her home has been sold to another customer at a much higher price. The IT consultant claims the luxury homes firm has left her about £, out of pocket in unexpected removal fees, storage fees, expenses and lost benefits of the HTB scheme. And she says its failure to deliver has denied her a chance of benefiting from the HTB scheme in the future as the criteria has now changed. She said: Iaposve been in a really dark place about it all and Iaposve had to seek counselling because of all the stress. Iaposve given them every opportunity to come back to me with some sort of compensation, or just to say sorry, and theyaposve ignored me. Iaposm now left out of a home - the way theyaposve treated me is absolutely ridiculous. Theyaposve had months and months to build that home.  They never should have exchanged contracts with me as there were only nine weeks to go before the initial deadline at that point, and Iaposm told it takes  weeks to build. Theyaposve blamed everything from Covid to having no brickies, but theyaposve been making good progress on their site at Fixby. Katie said she had been told by one executive she would be given a £, aposgoodwill gestureapos but she said sheaposd not even had her £ deposit ed, despite them selling the plot to someone . It was my dream home, she added. It was something I was very excited about. I know Covid has presented some challenges but theyaposve managed to build other houses but not mine. Iaposve had cost on cost over this but Iaposm never going to get another opportunity of financial assistance on another house and now Iaposve also missed out on the stamp duty freeze window. My le is now ruined by what this company have done and the fact that they have gone back on their word to provide some assistance or a small amount of compensation to cover my losses, it’s just disgusting. A spokesperson for Harron Homes Yorkshire said: We have experienced increased build timescales in the same way most other developers have during the pandemic, competing for resources and the effects on the supply chain. “Our Oaklands Heath development has a number of larger house types and in combination with a more challenging topography made it harder to predict completion time frames. “The government recognised the dficulties developers were experiencing and did extend the Help to Buy deadline to reduce the number of customers affected. Unfortunately we were unable to meet the revised deadline for Ms Grouse to take advantage of the Help to Buy scheme. We have allowed Ms Grouse to rescind her contract without penalty and we have given a refund of deposit monies.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHousing"},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth biggest baby","story":"NewsMum gives birth to biggest baby and people joke hes already paying taxesA mum took to TikTok to share the weight of her son in a video that has racked up a staggering five million views - and people joked that he looked like a full-grown manmirrorShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video mum-gives-birth-biggest-baby-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:NyxHfvp,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Sharing the story on Reddit, the twin said: I first started dating my now ex-girlfriend when we were both , however, we made the decision to break up before heading off to college when we were .I decided to go a few hours away while she decided to stay local. Also, note that my girlfriend was very close with my family so this was hard on my family as well.When ing home from my first year of college, my brother surprised me with the news that he had been dating a girl for over six months now.The only problem - it was my ex-girlfriend.  The twin said he was angry at his brother, but together they salvaged their relationship by agreeing that the three would never mingle together. He continued: I was obviously p****d and my brother understood but made it clear he had no intention of breaking up with her.Eventually we came to the agreement that we would continue our relationshiphe never mentioned her to me or made us interact - he happily agreed to these terms.However, recently my brother surprised me with the news that the two of them are now engaged, and he wants me to be his best man.I told him absolutely not.He and I had agreed from the beginning that I would not have to attend any event where my ex would be there.My whole family is calling me selfish and telling me I can suck it up for one night. But I just don’t feel comfortable being the best man at my ex’s wedding. The man sparked debate by sharing his story online, as although most people agreed he wasnapost in the wrong many thought the situation was very delicate. One user posted: I think dating your siblingaposs ex is a scummy thing to do. I think you handle the entire situation well, better than most people would, with the agreement you both came up with. I’m actually shocked your brother thought you’d say yes  Like that generally baffles me, why on earth would you be the best man at your brothers and ex-girlfriends wedding. And another user posted: I donapost knowyouaposre in the wrong, butyouaposre going to spend the rest of your le religiously avoiding the person your twin is married to because you dated her in high school, thataposs gonna make le pretty weird.Might be a good time to move forward for your sake and theirs.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRelationshipsViral"},{"url":null,"title":"doctors battling major covid surge","story":"NewsDoctors battling major Covid surge in India detect several new potential symptomsIndia is currently being ravaged by a second wave of Covid, with doctors in Bengaluru, in Karnataka state, believing they may have found several new signs of infection, possibly brought about due to mutated strainsmirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY News suits look after a COVID- coronavirus patient at the Intensive Care Unit of the Sharda Hospital, in Greater Noida\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _INDIA-HEALTH-VIRUS-HOSPITAL.jpg\"Doctors battling a devastating surge of cases in India believe they may have found new symptoms \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The most recognised signs to look out for are a persistent cough, high temperature and a loss of taste and smell.Some sufferers have also reported fatigue, headaches and diarrhoea, and a string of other symptoms have also emerged during the pandemic.And doctors in Bengaluru, in Indiaaposs Karnataka state, now believe an extremely dry mouth could be a new tell-tale sign of infection. Meanwhile irritation and an itching or vague sensation of pain in the tongue, or less commonly mouth ulcers, could also point towards the virus. Dr GB Sattur treated a man, aged , who had extreme dryness of the mouth and conjunctivitis when being admitted to hospital, he told local media.Have you experienced any of the symptoms Dr Sattur has pinpointed  Let us know at webnews@mirror I had read that conjunctivitis can be one of the symptoms of Covid. Though he didn’t have a fever, he said that he was tired, the doctor added, with the man later testing positive for Covid. Dr Sattur advised anyone who has symptoms to do with the mouth, as well as severe general weakness, to go for a test. He speculated that the new symptoms may be due to the mutated strains, including those first identied in India, Brazil and South Africa.  “Doctors should keep an eye on tongue complaints and not ignore them, Dr Sattur said. The government must do more genome sequencing to understand the iants better.” A similar symptom referred to as aposCovid tongueapos has previously been described in the UK.Gabriel Scally, a public health physician and president of epidemiology and public health at Royal Society of Medicine, told The Sun: Symptoms in the mouth have been described for some time in association with Covid-.” Dr Satturaposs warnings come as lockdown lts in England to allow people to mix indoors, with pubs, restaurants and cafes finally reopening. Pubs are back open and welcoming indoor diners and drinkers for the first time since November. People can also resume hugging, according to the government roadmap, with people also allowed to head to the cinema and theatre as well.  Boris Johnson said last week the final stages of lockdown easing on June  could be delayed as the Indian iant continues to spread throughout Britain.Sage scientists are reported to fear the mutation could be up to  percent more transmissible than current strains present in the country.

Suzy Eshkuntana woke up alone in Gaza’s largest medical facility after being rescued from the rubble left by the attack that tragically killed her mum and four siblings, it was revealed on Monday. She was then reunited in Sha hospital with her father, Riyad, who was also being treated for his wounds. He immediately begged his daughter’s forgiveness for having been unable to free her himself. Riyad told her: “Forgive me You screamed to me to come to you, but I couldn’t come.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  It came as families in Gaza were on Monday counting the cost of the most devastating onslaught so far. Waves of Israeli attacks took the death toll to at least , with  children known to be among the dead. Some , people have so far been injured in the Palestinian territory. As many as ten Israelis have been killed and  wounded as the Jewish state has came under rocket attacks.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had already vowed the campaign against Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants based in Gaza will continue with “full force,” adding it “would take time to finish.” And as many as  Israeli jets bombed  targets in just  minutes on Monday. Among those killed in the devastating barrage was a top Islamic Jihad leader, Hussam Abu Harbeed. Israel claims that a record , rockets had been fired into its own towns and cities from Gaza in the past week.  In a statement confirming it had killed Harbeed, the Israeli military said he “was behind several anti-tank missile terror attacks against Israeli civilians.” Chiefs said that those attacks included one on the first day of the current round of fighting, which they said had injured a civilian in Israel. Harbeed had been a commander with Islamic Jihad for  years, it said. Downing Street said it was seeking answers from Israel about other attacks which destroyed a building housing the Associated Press and other media outlets in Gaza. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman said: “We are deeply concerned by UN reports that more than  schools and  homes as well as medical facilities and media offices have been destroyed or seriously damaged.”The aerial bombardment began after Hamas rockets were fired at the cities of Beersheba and Ashkelon. One of those missiles slammed into a synagogue hours before evening services for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, local emergency services said.  No injuries were reported following the incident. Israeli aircraft then launched their own raids, with the Israel Defence Forces saying nine residences belonging to high-ranking Hamas commanders had been hit. It was claimed some of the homes were being used to store weapons caches.  Gaza’s people say the horror they are experiencing is worse than ever. Samir al-Khatib, an emergency worker, said: “I have not seen this level of destruction through my  years of work. “Not even in the  war.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBenjamin NetanyahuBoris JohnsonUnited NationsHamasIslamic JihadPoliticsMiddle EastMiddle East"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/10/19987174_36658259-1-590x372.jpg ","title":"charlie adam reveals dundee used tynecastle trauma as motivation to spur them to within touching distance of play off promotion","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee used the humiliating - opening day thumping at Hearts as motivation to get them to within touching distance of the Premiership.Club captain Charlie Adam made his league debut for his boyhood club that night at Tynecastle but, despite scoring a superb goal, couldn’t prevent a crushing defeat by the eventual league champions.However, he has revealed his pride in the team at Dens Park after putting a “sticky” patch behind them earlier in the season to move to within two matches of promotion.They will face Kilmarnock in the two-legged final over the next week after seeing off Raith Rovers in the semi with a - aggregate victory.“I am just really proud of where we have come from,” he said.“We had a sticky part at the start of the season and used that first-day defeat to Hearts to try and motivate us to get into this position.“We are two games away from the Premiership and it is going to be exciting.”He added: “To get through these next two games is going to take some hard graft, a bit of luck and some quality.“If we turn up on our day then we will give ourselves a chance.“There is a lot at stake. It has been a long time since the club was in the Premiership.“Look at the Premiership next season, there are a lot of good clubs and there will be big games.“Rangers have won the league by  points but they are going to need to improve again.“Celtic and Aberdeen will be under new management, Jack Ross has done well at Hibs and across the road there is another derby for us.“But this final is going to be tough.“We have to use the experience from Wednesday and Saturday that no matter what score it is it is never over.“In the end, it was a battling performance.“We are delighted to be in the final.”They booked that final place with a - aggregate victory over Raith Rovers in the semi-final.An impressive - victory at Stark’s Park in the first leg was followed by that “battling performance” at Dens Park on Saturday night.Though that finished in a - defeat and ended their nine-match unbeaten run in the league, Adam says the good mood around Dundee won’t be affected.“Defeat only resets you a wee bit” he said.“We will be playing a good team but we are also a good team.“We have been in good form.“You don’t want to get beat but it happens.“We will look over it and we will be prepared and ready to go Thursday and Monday.”Of Saturday night#s game, he added: “It is easy to say now that it was won after the first-leg.“We were excellent in the first game and in the second leg we never got going but we still created enough to win the game.“It was a dficult result. We were - up and suddenly they got one and there was a bit of pressure.“The run of form we went on to get to second place was great.“We are going into the play-off games confident.“If we turn up in the two games then we will be in the Premiership.“We are excited and looking forward to it.”The big pressure is often thought to be on the Premiership side in these play-off finals.However, Adam rejects that and insists there will be more than enough expectation on Dundee as they look to end their time in the second tier.“There is a pressure on us,# he said.“We are a big club and there is a pressure on us to get back to the Premiership. | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed CEIsUMmg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“The pressure and onus and expectation as a football club to get back to the Premiership is there.“We are excited about it and the boys in our dressing-room will relish that challenge.“We have a good group of players. There is pressure on both teams and we will be confident.” Dundee analysis: Dee hearts aflutter but Dark Blues have earned their shot at a Premiership \" title\"#Dundee analysis: Dee hearts aflutter but Dark Blues have earned their shot at a Premiership #

However, that risks being underminedthose same families are going to have their support cut by an uncaring UK Government.“Just as the Scottish Child Payment has lted children out of poverty, this rumoured cut would plunge children back into hardship. It needs to be ruled out once and for all and that will only happen with the uplt being made permanent.”A spokesman for the UK Government said ministers were #committed# to helping those on Universal Credit and providing support to job seekers.He added: “We are committed to supporting families who are most in need, spending billions more on welfare, protecting jobs through furlough and helping people find new work through our Plan for Jobs.#We also introduced our £ million Covid Local Support Grant to help children and families stay warm and well-fed throughout the pandemic.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/vaccine-rollout-140521-e1621007541735-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

at Curl Aberdeen.Mouat said: “We started pretty fast and managed to get a good lead, - after four ends.“From there it felt like we were controlling the game and got on top of the ice so it was a great start.“It is nice to be in an environment where we know what Aberdeen is going to be like.“Obviously it is a shame that we cannot have any crowd here because it would be amazing to have family and friends watching.“Maybe another opportunity for that will come our way down the line, but for now we are happy to be here and happy to be playing.”Dodds was pleased to make her debut in the tournament.She and Mouat won the Scottish title last year, but the pandemic meant the World Mixed Championships didn’t take place in .Dodds said: “I feel like it was a long time coming, so I was a bit nervous going into the first game.“But once you have had practice and you have thrown your first stone at the first end you kind of settle in quite easily.“So it was a good to get going and we are glad to get that first win on the board.”Dodds and Mouat started strongly picking up doubles in ends two and three to establish a - lead, with a single in the next adding to the advantage.In the fth end Italy struck back and picked up two shots, but a double from the Scots in the next was enough to secure victory with Italy only picking up one in end seven before throwing in the towel.As well as trying to win a World Championship medal Dodds and Mouat are hoping to secure a spot for Great Britain in the mixed doubles event at next year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing.To do that they need to finish in the top seven this week.Elsewhere at Curl Aberdeen the Czech Republic beat Australia -, Canada beat Spain -, Germany prevailed - against Hungary and Korea won - against Russia.On Tuesday Scotland face Australia at am and Spain at pm in their next two Group A games.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 23 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le. As the founders of the NHS said: #From the cradle to the grave#.Hiding in plain sight in this report, in the small print, is this statement: #Politicians, health care professionals and the public must all be involvedour primary care system is to survive.# As Oprah Winfrey would put it, #WHAT # If this is what is at stake, why have we not heard more about it  Why was it enough to contact so few people among our erse population Why has health management locally cast our group out in the cold We are open to all and represent a wide cross section of community interests. And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers. It is literally a fight for the lives of ourselves and generations after us.We need all the support we can get."},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray castle set to reopen for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"new crop of msps welcomed","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room.

Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence.

Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We decided this is something we can do safely, while also making the community smile, just like the previous flock did, eight whole years ago.#Please get in touchyou would like further details.#To find out how to get involved with the latest #flamingo flocking# campaign, email Agnes Stewart on Ags@yahoo, telephone   or contact the @CGSGambia Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"district news may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The one on the shore has been there for more than a year, but the caravan on the high road has been left there as no-one overlooks that spot.#A spokesperson for Argyll and Bute Council said: #We remove anything on council property andany of the areas identied are private land it is the responsibility of the owner or occupier to act.#We will make sure they are notied, work with them to have items removed and do what we can to identy the offender.#The fixed penalty notice for fly tipping is £. If it is not paid, prosecution could result in a fine of up to £,. We all have to play a part in keeping our communities free of rubbish by using the many waste and recycling centres we have in Argyll and Bute.#We are committed to ensuring public spaces in Argyll and Bute are maintained to a high standard and ask that any fly-tipping is reported to us either online at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk or by calling  .#ISLAY:Plans to convert a byre into living accommodation on Islay have been given the go-ahead by council chiefs.The proposals by Simon Coughlin for the site at Brookfield House in Portnahaven were submitted to Argyll and Bute Council in February.And with no objections received from the public, council planning officers have granted planning permission.An officer said in a holding report that the plans involved converting the barn into a one bedroom, one and a half storey annexe to the main house.They said: #The westerly elevation will have full height glazing doors to the main habitable rooms. The land to the west is within the settlement boundary but has no housing allocation.#It is therefore not deemed there will be neighbouring amenity issues regarding the proposal.#The northerly elevation will have gable height glazing to the living room and the mezzanine void space. The bedroom en-suite and office is served by rooflights.#There will be a porch to the west for utility reasons which will have a sloping roof to the eaves. The main roof is to be traditional slate with the walls re-using the stone. There is a single door on the easterly elevation and a chimney for the stove on that roof elevation.#A condition will be attached to any approval regarding the materials to be used. The design maintains the vernacular of the former byre and is deemed to be sympathetic to the main house and its setting as a listed building.#The officer added: #According to Scottish Water, there is no public waste water infrastructure within the vicinity of this proposed development and therefore advise the applicant to investigate private treatment options. The proposal can be fed from the Port Charlotte water works.#The council#s roads department highlights that the use of the existing private access to main road is acceptable.#The proposal is deemed to be an acceptable repurposing of an appropriate vacant building within an existing community and using existing infrastructure. It is also consistent with the council#s aim to reverse static or falling populations in a smaller rural community.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"new inspector looks learns and loves argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I#m taking everything and everyone at face value.#Though fresh to the job and area,  Inspector Collins won#t be charging in with his new broom.#I#m wary of coming in and trying to revolutionise everything,# he said.#There#s no way I know more than the folk who have worked here for #X# amount of years.#But that#s not to say that I won#t have ideas and plans going forward. Any plans I do have, though, will need to be linked to what I#m hearing from local people, both residents and police officers.#As he looks, listens and learns, he emphasised the importance of the bond between the police and local communities.#That working partnership is important,# he said. #They need us, but we need the community as well.#I come from a community policing background, and I do care about what I do # in a tight community people will soon knowI don#t care.#I want our officers to be out there and visible, and in order for me to fix things I need the community to tell me what the problems are.#Coming into the job during a pandemic, Inspector Collins sees the police role as supporting people as lockdown restrictions begin to ease.#As traffic begins to pick up and there are more people around I believe we should be there to look after people in the community and help them to adjust to lots of folk coming in.#For visitors, we need to adopt an education stance because those leaving litter behind, lighting fires and the rest of it are often doing it from a standpoint of ignorance.#I want people to come and visit Argyll and enjoy it, but more importantly the people who live here have to be foremost in everything we do.#The geography of Argyll is on a dferent scale to that seen in Lanarkshire, and the inspector admitted he was adjusting to this aspect of rural policing. With fewer police stations and big areas to cover, he says that partnership is key.#I#d love to be able to click my fingers and open more police offices, but that#s not the world we live in. It#s about working smarter and in partnership with others.#He continued: #I#ve spent some time getting out and about and I#m still getting used to the size of the area, but it#s gorgeous.#Though still travelling back to Hamilton at weekends to his we and two-year-old daughter, the plan is to move the whole family to Argyll in time.Inspector Collins concluded: #I#m looking forward to getting my we and daughter across here, because I think they#ll fall in love with Argyll just as I have.#"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ranging in age from one to five years old, the children and their teddies walked, ran and danced from the ferry terminal to the former paddling pool, where they received special medals and certicates and enjoyed a picnic. On Monday, they were joined by Lyle at the finish line.Visit gofundme f inclusive-swing-for-campbeltown-playpark to contribute to the fundraiser."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These campaigns testy not to an instinct for the #survival of the fittest# but to an inbuilt recognition that justice should be done.This should not be surprising. Our Creator is a God of justice made in his image, we reflect his character. He takes particular care to demand that minorities and vulnerable people receive, not just equality, but special respect and privilege and that justice should be upheld.Psalm : reads: #The Lord watches over the sojourners [racial minority], He upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked, he brings to ruin.# Justice is good.However, BLM and #Me Too aren#t sufficient to right society#s wrongs. Why  Because while pointing to the guilt of others, they fail to recognise we#re all guilty. We#ve all failed to love our neighbours as ourselves, we#ve all marginalised and discriminated against those not like us, even the protestor, even the victim perhaps not based on colour, but certainly on class, status or some other dference.This is where the Bible paints the full picture, justice is right, but reconciliation happens only through forgiveness. The Lord who leads in justice and who will judge all guilt, also leads in forgiveness. In the cross of Jesus, he absorbed the price of justice. He took the initiative. #While we were still sinners, Christ died for us#.The gt of God#s forgiveness is on offer. When we receive it and recognise all we#ve been forgiven, then forgiveness flows out to others and reconciliation begins."},{"url":null,"title":"cinema preparing to roll out the red carpet for reopening","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Then, something caught his eye.He ran to Izzy: ldquoAunty, aunty, look what I found!He was holding a scarf.ldquoIt was hanging on a tree over there, he said.It was a short neck scarf, with Celtic interlacing design it looked new and unworn, possibly even handmade.ldquoI really love it aunty, can I keep it Izzy pursed her lips in thought.ldquoI dunno, Finn, someone may have dropped it and another person found it and placed it on the tree to keep it safe. Perhaps one of those walkers earlier. Maybe they will come back and look for it Finn wasnrsquot even half listening. He put the scarf on and rushed to the loch side to look at his reflection.ldquoIt would be safer round my neck surely  he called out.As he arranged the scarf, a folded piece of paper fell to the ground and landed by Finnrsquos feet. He picked it up, unfolded it and ran to Izzy, very excited.ldquoLook, the scarf is for me! he exclaimed.A worried look came over Izzyrsquos face as Finn handed her the piece of paper. There were beautully drawn Celtic designs, with images of what looked like faeries hiding in a wood.There was also a sleeping dragon curled round a heart shape in which there was handwriting: ldquoIf you have found me, and you like me, then Irsquom yours. Keep me safe, until itrsquos time to give me away.Izzy looked at Finn, nodded and smiled. ldquoSo it seems.ldquoI will never give this away! he insisted. He looked around at the trees and ed the gaze to his aunt.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, aunty, maybe fairies do exist after all, at least here we are in the Highlands after all.He thought for a moment. ldquoOr maybe itrsquos just someone kind who likes to give presents.Finn headed back to the tree where hersquod found the scarf. He arranged twigs and broken bits of heather on the ground next to the tree and beckoned his aunt to come see.She looked down at what hersquod done. She didnrsquot immediately see it, but then realised that the twigs and heather formed letters.He carefully read it: ldquoThank you.ldquoThatrsquos lovely Finn, whoever left the scarf will see this and be very happy, Irsquom sure of it.Izzy looked up to the sky. The predicted rain was going to hold off.ldquoFinn, she said hesitantly, ldquowould you be up for a bit of an adventure ldquoYou mean a walk, donrsquot you ldquoKind of, aye, but this is to a place I have never been before, although Irsquove often seen it from a distance.ldquoHow far  asked Finn.Izzy pointed: ldquoJust there, where those old trees are. Itrsquos a small remnant of the old Caledonian forest, Irsquove often wanted to visit it but have never had the opportunity. Itrsquos not so far, but it might be a bit dficult to reach, Irsquove never explored it before.Finn wasnrsquot sure.Izzy helped him decide: ldquoIt might have a connection to the original Merlin.That sold it to him.ldquoWell, I have my boots, he smiled, ldquocan I lead the way So they set off in the direction of Coille Coire Chuic, a small remnant of the ancient Caledonian forest. Izzy let Finn decide on the route and as they neared the wood they arrived at the River Cononish. There was no obvious and safe way to cross, but Izzy was sure there was a small bridge downriver.The route got increasingly boggy and Izzy suspected Finn may want to give up, but instead he took the role of leader seriously and carefully planned each step, identying dryer patches and helping his aunt. They made slow progress, but with much hilarity as they balanced on small tufts of dry land surrounded by bog myrtle.Finn paused and listened. The noise of a waterfall could be heard ahead and he aimed for it. Izzy lagged behind to take in the beauty of the heather, which carpeted the ground with a blaze of purple and pink. The old Scots pines on the other side of the river looked magnicent, framed by the mountains beyond.She caught up with Finn, who was sitting on a rock watching the waterfall. It cascaded into a hidden pool, where the water twirled and bubbled asin a giant cauldron. Scots pine trees stood guard on the edge of it, one growing precariously from the overhanging rocks, its trunk curving upwards so its higher branches reached the sunlight. A gnarled rowan with vivid berries grew from the rocks on the other side, while on the opposite bank birch trees clung onto the steep side of the river, bent over like weeping willows.Finn wanted to sit awhile and so Izzy took it as an opportunity to make a brew for them both. He was beginning to understand that using her small camping stove was an important ritual for his aunt: the hissing sound, the waiting, the trail of steam, the anticipation it made a warm feeling, turned a wild place into home.They sipped tea together and shared well-earned snacks. Finn waited, expecting his aunt to tell a story. Finally, she did.ldquoSee that giant boulder over there, Finn, it was dropped by the giants who sculpted this land many years ago.ldquoLike with Samsonrsquos stone we saw Izzy nodded.Finn raised a cynical eyebrow and half a smile.ldquoHuge giants, Finn, a race called the Fomorians. The legend says they emerged from the sea long ago ndash grotesque troll-like creatures, incredibly powerful and cruel. Two of them made Rannoch Moor their home and they terrorised the people for miles around, destroying homes and taking livestock.ldquoNobody knew what to do, even the bravest and best warriors were defeated by them, ripped apart without mercy. Then a young lad about your age had his home destroyed by one of the giants, and in his grief he decided to rid the land of them.ldquoBut how could he do thateven the best warriors couldnrsquot Izzy gave him a wry smile, which he knew meant that was a good question and that she was just about to answer it.ldquoThe lad was wise. He had noticed how the two giants argued with each other about who was the stronger.ldquoSo he got them to fight each other ldquoKind of, he persuaded them to have a competition to see who could throw a stone furthest. They began hurling bigger and bigger stones, then they tore chunks of rock off the mountain sides. Soon the land was littered with boulders, and after three days the two giants were utterly exhausted.ldquoThen the young lad told one of the giants he had won, for he knew this would cause a fight. And so it did.ldquoThe giants fought each other with fury, using up what energy they had left. Finally, one gave the other a fatal blow, but it was the last thing he did, as he collapsed with total exhaustion.ldquoThey had killed each other ldquoYes, smiled Izzy, filling her cup with more tea and raising it. ldquoThatrsquos why the land around here is littered with all these huge stones.ldquoI know giants are mythological, aunty.Izzy sipped some tea.ldquoDepends what kind of giants you mean.Finn looked at the boulder.ldquoThe next tale is the gt of the sun, continued Izzy.ldquoAfter the death of the giants the land was bathed in sunshine, bringing new le.It became a green world, grass and plants grew, then trees arrived. The ancestors of this tree were first to arrive, she pointed to the nearby silver birch.ldquoOthers followed: the rowan, the aspen, alder and even oak. But it was these trees which made the forest canopy: Scots pines, also called Caledonian pines, an old name given to them by the Romans. Arenrsquot they a beautul tree Finn peered at the Scots pines around them.ldquoCreatures filled the forest with their songs, their roars, their grunting and howling the birds, bears, wolves, elk, deer and boar. Seven thousand years ago, where we sit we would have been amidst the Caledonian forest in its prime. Those trees over there are the descendants of that forest. If you sit with them and feel their presence, they will tell you their stories.Finn chuckled at his aunt, then explained why. ldquoYou are like Yoda! He defensively held up his hands to explain: ldquoNot the way you look, I mean the way you speak about things.Finn was a Star Wars fan. He had all three films on video at home and knew much of the dialogue by heart. He spoke to Izzy, mimicking Yodarsquos voice: ldquoSearch the force, le creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. Finn gently pinched Izzy on the shoulder, saying: ldquoNot this crude matter. You must feel the force around you, the tree, the rock, everywhere.Izzy laughed out loud, feeling rather flattered to be compared to one of Finnrsquos screen heroes. She thanked him for the compliment.Finn looked over at the old Scots pines on the other side of the river. He knew his aunt wanted to reach them and they were tantalisingly close, yet the river was too dangerous to cross.ldquoLetrsquos find a way to get there, he ventured.They packed up and followed the river, eventually finding a place to cross. They sat amidst the flowering heather under the canopy of old trees, near a clearing so a light breeze kept the midges at bay. As promised, Izzy spun legends of Merlin, but also other tales connected to the ancient forest: of Lailoken, the Picts and St Columba, and the sad tale of the last wolf. Finn added tales of his own, about Jedi Knights and what he could remember of the story of Tam Linn. The forest was both their theatre and audience. But there was a sense of melancholy in this wood, for something was missing: it was bereft of young trees. The old pines were missing their children.The walk back was much quicker and they arrived back at the car tired, but with a sense of achievement. It felt asthey had been in a dferent world.ldquoCan we camp tonight aunty  asked Finn. ldquoAnd have a campfire like the first night ldquoLetrsquos see how the weather holds and how we feel later, she replied, keeping options open.Food was now a priority and Izzy was keen to get away from the busyness of Tyndrum. Soon they were on their way, heading for Loch Tulla, where she planned to make their tea. She knew Ewen would already be at the Bridge of Orchy.

that the proposals would free up two additional local police officers for the county.However, concerns were raised by councillors about the additional journey time it would take for officers to transport people in custody to the Edinburgh station.Suzie Mertes, from Police Scotlandrsquos Criminal Justice Services ision, said that the number of people being taken into custody in Scotland had halved from , to , in recent timesand changes were being made as part of an annual review.She told the committee that providing custody services at St Leonardrsquos would be better for prisoners who might be vulnerable as more support services were available and would benefit local officers who were currently drafted in to ldquobackfill for custody officers when they were on leave.It was not made clear whether the decision to take custody officers away from Dalkeith would see opening hours of the station reduced or changed.However, Ms Mertes stressed that the custody facilities would not close completely and would be available for major events in the area or times when it was felt they were needed.And she said that current custody staff based at Dalkeith would be given the option to transfer their services to support local policing.She added: ldquoIn terms of Dalkeith, should someone need to be brought in for an interview it will be open.ldquoThis is a flexible model that will

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons. Local businesses desperate to rebuild and get customers in their doors.Economic recovery is what matters to so many, yet we are so embroiled in constitutional questions that we lose sight of the ramications the past year has had for so many businesses and iniduals who have lost their jobs and families living below thepoverty line.There is no denying the fact that there is indeed an appetite to reopen the debate around independence, the recent vote shows an almost   split down the middle, but I do not believe it should be up to the media to frame the discussion.There is a huge job ahead for the next Scottish Government to deliver on a national recovery and all opposition politicians and members of the press must be focused on holding them accountable for the measures they are taking to get the country back on its feet.Letrsquos not do Alex Salmondrsquos job for him by inadvertently holding the SNPrsquos feet to the fire over independence but instead hold their feet to the fire over the nationrsquos recovery from the pandemic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Sitting in the Macbobrsquos main auditorium with my sister-in-law I looked around to see two other people in the audience. Four seats filled in a venue that could hold, in pre-socially distanced times, . Such were the times.I didnrsquot really care much for the movie, an overengineered high-concept thing, to be honest. But it was good to be in a cinema again. Especially this cinema. This was where I did most of my student film-going back in the s. In more recent years Irsquove seen films in its smaller, custom-made cinema, but on this night we were in the larger theatre which was where my younger self had sat all those years ago.I spent a lot of time during Tenet thinking about the times Irsquod sat in this room before. The filmrsquos central idea ndash of two dferent time streams travelling in reverse directions and intersecting ndash only encouraged it.I found myself wondering thatI sat there long enough I might catch a glimpse of my younger self, sitting in this same cinema nearly  years before when I was a student, at a Saturday morning matinee of the s sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet, surrounded by kids, sitting beside a girl I was totally smitten with, who, in the timestream that was running forward from that moment, would later become my we.That thought ndash of being back in the same room in  with the person I loved most in the world but who had died in  ndash made the night worthwhile, evenI didnrsquot care much for the movie.In the absence of movie-going over the last year Irsquove been thinking a lot since last September about how cinema was at the heart of our relationship, and how our first days together were spent in the dark.The first time Irsquod ever had a proper talk with Jeanie was about the movies. A late-night conversation in the kitchen about an old screwball murder mystery wersquod both seen that summer called A Night to Remember, starring Loretta Young and Brian Aherne, a chat interrupted when a fellow student came in from a night out spent drinking Pernod and black and hiccupped up his evening all over the table. A few weeks later watching Paul Schraderrsquos Cat People at the Allanpark cinema in Stirling I watched Ed Begley Jr get his arm chewed off by a black leopard. In the film the blood washed across the floor and over Nastassja Kinskirsquos shoes just like the Pernod and Black across the table, I remember thinking.Those first few months with Jeaniewere spent at the movies. Afternoons and evenings all spent in the dark. Some days wersquod make a day of it, travelling through to Falkirk and the ABC cinema in the afternoon and then back to Stirling for an evening showing. We even watched the films now and then.Trashy horror was our favourite, though, thinking back, Irsquom not sure how appropriate The Entity ndash a lurid film in which Barbara Hershey is molested by an invisible demon, unmakeable nowndash really was as a date movie.Itrsquos a pretty normal pattern for a love story, isnrsquot it  Itrsquos what couples did, still do, . In Phantom Empire, his  book about cinema and its impact on us, the cultural commentator Geoffrey OrsquoBrien asks at one point, ldquoWhat did people do, anyway, before there were movies  Well, exactly.Cinema was our idea of fun. It was a pattern set in both our childhoods. Jeanie always told me that she had left the Brownies after she came home to find that her dad and her sister had gone to see Krakatoa, East of Java without her.Irsquod grown up in Northern Ireland watching Disney movies, James Bond films and Zulu at the local fleapit . I remember taking an Action Man pistol with me to see Jaws for reassurance.Irsquod go and see films and then rush back the next night to see them again. Good films, bad films, indferent films. Even the much-maligned  version of King Kong .Years later Irsquod tell its star Jeff Bridges that Irsquod seen it more than once. I think, I said, it might have been because of Jessica Lange. ldquoYeah, he agreed, laughing, ldquoit might have had something to do with her.Cinema was always a desire machine. The sex symbols of the th century were film stars . From Rudolph Valentino to Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean right up to Scarlett Johansson.Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It HotBut it was always about more than sex. The critic Molly Haskell writing in Film Commentrsquos new weekly newsletter the other week quoted Susan Sontag on the post-war embrace of the idea of the movies as art, ldquoborn of a conviction that cinema was an art unlike another: quintessentially modern, distinctively accessible poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral hellip That was still the case in the s and s when we started watching. In time, we fell in love with Chinarsquos Fth Generation filmmakersand the outrageousness of early Almodo.But cinema also offered what it has always offered a dream of escape, of lives unlived of glamour and aspiration at times. And also fear and anxiety and the thrill chill of the dark. A spectacle shared with other people sitting in the dark.Therersquos an electric thrill when a film is good to share it with an audience. The collective rush of it. Sometimes the audience are irritating, of course. Sometimes, they are the only fun. I remember watching some second-rate movie in New York. The rest of the audience were really into it, however, cheering and whooping at every action sequence. They made the movie more entertaining than it really was.And now here we are, after a year without movies, more or less . Therersquos a lot of hot air talked about how the pandemic might be the end of cinema. I donrsquot really buy it. It will take cinemas time to come to terms with the new situation as they are allowed to reopen, but audiences will .Cinema is changing, of course.

All will turn up on streaming services, sooner or later. But to see them in the cinema is still the ultimate viewing experience. Size still matters.The last film I took Jeanie to see, a few weeks before her death, was Crawl, about a Florida hurricane and man-eating alligators. She loved a good scary movie. I am inordinately fond of this film now because it was the last time I got to sit in a cinema and hold her hand.I will never be able to do that again. But I can go and sit in the dark again.

She shouts over the clamour nonplussed - all that noise means action, le ing, businesses reopening.Not that her Borough Market restaurant, Mei Mei, has been dormant through the last year. Opening just a few months before the pandemic completely shuttered bars and restaurants, Haigh quickly pivoted to takeout, meal kits, and feeding the vulnerable and local key workers.Speaking a few days before outdoor dining resumed in England, shes buzzed. \"I cannot wait to share things on plates again Im sick to death of putting everything in takeaway packaging.\"Singapore-born Haigh, , trained as an architect before turning to food via a stint on MasterChef in . She went on to win a Michelin star while at Pidgin in Hackney. Now shes written her first cookbook, Makan, whose title means dinnertime, or lets eat. Haigh calls the book \"a love letter to my family\" and \"our Singaporean heritage\". Its packed with the Singaporean dishes she grew up eating , using seasonal ingredients found in Britain .In the book, she writes: When people move and mix together, food just gets better - and is adamant thats true, \"because food represents community. And without community, theres no food, theres no recipes, theres no knowledge of culture and dishes.\"She says peoples interpretation of Singaporean food is often confined to Singapore noodles, which is nonsense. \"One type of noodles in Singapore  It doesnt exist,\" Haigh scoffs. \"[That is] a fusion of someones idea of Singapore.\"While high streets tend to be brilliantly spiked with restaurants celebrating Indian, Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese food, Singaporean restaurants often just arent in the mix. \"There are many great ones, but just not enough,\" says Haigh, and its that representation thats been missing.Partly its down to the exceptional culinary secret-keeping of Singaporean home cooks. \"Makan represents the culture of my mum,\" explains Haigh. \"She cooks a lot, like a lot of her generation, but they dont really pass on that knowledge because its just their way of showing love, that they do all the cooking.\"Haigh had to doggedly prise the knowledge out of her mum, but youll be glad she did. The recipes in the Nonya Secrets chapter, featuring her spiced chicken noodle soup, Gado Gado peanut salad, Malay hot and sour noodles, in particular are ones \"she would go probably to her grave withshe could I had to beg her to share them with me\".Telling her mum these very personal recipes were to be published in a book \"took some convincing\", but Haigh had a strategy. \"I promised a lot of cooking - and a dedication.\" It was also important to her to be able to make these dishes for her three-year-old son, Riley, so he could share them with his friends. \"Thats the way to get your mother, bribe her by using the grandson as leverage,\" she says wryly. \"I just wanted it to be normalised, so its a cuisine everyone recognises more, and that he can be proud of.\"In a climate where Asian hate is increasingly making headlines, exacerbated by Covid, and attacks on iniduals and businesses are escalating, representation is again crucial. \"Ive had that all my le, right \" says Haigh of anti-Asian racism. \"Im glad that everyones got more of a voice to stand up against it now, because its just not tolerable.\"If you normalise this style of cuisine and this food and people know more about Singaporean culture,\" she continues, \"it [becomes] normal. Its just representation it really does matter.\"Unravelling and then recreating her mothers recipes was a challenge in itself though Haigh had to translate her mums ingredient guestimation and dismantle some of the internal scaffolding of her own classical French training, \"building it back up again, as per how my mum wanted it to be\". She hadnt previously needed those recipes sequestered in her brain. \"Traditionally in my generation, not lots of Singaporeans cook,\" Haigh explains. \"In Singapore, were absolutely spoilt for choice by hawker food. Its more common to go eat somewhere because its so cheap.\"The homesickness involved in not being able to travel or access that delicious, clamorous street food world, was another motivation for Makan, \"to recreate those dishes and recreate those memories\".Ask her what shell do the second she can visit Singapore again, and Haigh is instantly imagining taking a taxi from the airport straight to her customary hawker. \"Ill probably be there with my dad, sitting at our usual table,\" she says. \"Well order all the satays, and a bucket of beer. And probably some barbecue chicken wings - everythings on the barbecue. And they have stingray as well, which is wrapped up in banana leaves and a layer of sambal tumis belacan [a spicy, limey sambal sauce with fermented shrimp paste]. And its just absolutely ine. For me, thats heaven. It hits you in the face, that chilli is so spicy. The chillies in Southeast Asia are just another level of heat.\"The moment dictates the meal: \"For Singaporeans, thats how we choose what we eat and when\". Soyou need something hearty, itd be her Hainanese chicken rice business on\" or a rendang. If under the weather, shed turn to noodle soups, and for celebrations, itd have to be Singapore chilli crab.Whatever the mood though, eating is paramount. Instead of saying Hello as a greeting, Singaporeans are likely to say, Are you hungry , or, Shall we get some food .\"Lets cut out the necessities,\" says Haigh with a laugh. \"Are we going to eat or not \" Andwhoever youre with isnt planning on eating, then \"its basically, Oh, are you gonna watch me eat \"Its that delight - in eating, cooking and trying food - that Haigh hopes to bestow. \"Im a feeder, just like my mum,\" she says. \"I wanted to write Makan so much because I wanted to share that joy.\" And you cant not feel it in every recipe.Makan: Recipes From The Heart Of Singapore by Elizabeth Haigh is published by Bloomsbury Absolute, priced pound.

This would be in tandem with a keen ongoing focus on mental wellbeing.A reasonable timescale then for a phased approach could be testing hybrid models in the autumn, allowing arrangements to evolve naturally, followed by new ways of working being formalised in the new year.Underpinning this will necessarily be assurances on staff safety.

Nevertheless, Irsquom increasingly concerned about the relationship between humans and animals. The unease has been sharpened by recent barbaric footage, released by Animal Equity UK, of piglets allegedly being hammered to death on the concrete floor of an Aberdeenshire farm. Hollywood actor Karen Gillan has shared the footage with her . million followers, first warning them it is ldquovery upsetting. A quick trawl of the internet suggests that similar mistreatment is not unknown at farms and abattoirs up and down the country.The current crop of farming programmes possibly presents a cuddly and sanitised version of modern animal husbandry. The stars of programmes such as This Week on the Farm, Our Yorkshire Farm, This Farming Le and Our Farm in the Dales unquestionably care deeply about their livestock and tend them well. Nevertheless, therersquos a lingering suspicion they are not entirely typical. None of the programmes feature the massive agri-businesses that rely on intensive methods that involve overcrowding and severely restricting the freedom and movement of animals. The programmes offer few,any, insights into the transport of cattle, pigs and lambs or the reality of what happens to them at the slaughter facility. These are sentient creatures that experience pain and fear just as we do. There are those in the industry who tell us the animals are cheerfully unaware of what is about to happen when they are at the abattoir. The obvious question being, how can they be so sure  The animals certainly canrsquot tell us. Foodies and restaurant reviewers paint equally unconvincing pictures of lambs and the like leading full and happy lives gambolling on the sunlit uplands. Aye right. There is a spectrum of philosophical argument about the rights and wrongs of raising and killing animals for meat. At one end are those who contend it violates the animalsrsquo absolute rights and interests. At the other, are those who argue without meat-eating humans, the animals wouldnrsquot be alive in the first place. Which dodges the slight ethical issue of the quality andof that le.Food and travel writer, AA Gill, had no moral scruples about eating meat. He famously declared that he would ldquoeat anything that didnrsquot have a birth certicate, which suggested he would have happily dined on dog or cat meat. In purely philosophical terms, therersquos no dference between eating a sensitive and intelligent pig and eating Rover or Kitty. They probably taste like chicken. If humans donrsquot buy into ethical arguments against meat eating, how about a bit of self-interest  In industrial-scale agriculture, antibiotics are routinely used to prevent the spread of disease amongst closely confined cattle. They are also used to breed larger and more quickly growing animals. Unsurprisingly, there is increasing evidence that over use of antibiotics in farm animals is contributing to their reduced effectiveness in the treatment of human infections. Only last year the World Health Organisationwarned, ldquowe are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.Read more:Old time politics were enriched by the lost art of hecklingOur track record in heeding such warnings is not good. We largely ignored the lessons of the  outbreak of Avian influenza, summed up in Dr Michael Gregerrsquos  book, Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching. The Australian Animal Justice Party estimates that  per cent of infectious diseases are zoonotic, transferring directly from animals and insects to humans. Such transference may well have been linked to outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome . Itrsquos suspected the latter transferred from camels to humans. BSE, the so-called ldquomad cow disease, was linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The WHO has warned, ldquowild animals are the source of % of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses. Professor David Benetar of Cape Town University writing in the NY Times has warned: ldquoSimply put, the coronavirus epidemic is a result of our gross maltreatment of animals.\" There is a similarity between SARS-CoV - and a virus found in pangolin, one of the worldrsquos most illegally trafficked animals. Pangolin were possibly the intermediary or amplier of the virus spreading between bats and humans.Read more:Covid recovery: Forget Eat Out to Help Out, it should be Get Out to Work OutThe WHO commissioned report, ldquoCovid-: Make it the Last Pandemic, has much to say about the ways in which poor communication, inadequate leadership and lack of transparency all contributed to the spread and extent of the coronavirus pandemic. It has disappointingly little to say about tackling the root causes of the pandemic, including human encroachment on the habitats of wild animals and the existence of wet markets in Asia and Africa. Affluent countries are playing Russian Roulette with zoonotic disease. We rely on our relative wealth and science to come up with ldquojust in time vaccines to respond to the threat they pose. Without pre-emptive action itrsquos almost inevitable that one such disease will win the race against vaccine development. In that event it wonrsquot just be the worldrsquos poorest countries that bear the brunt. If complacency isnrsquot to be the death of us, we need to be proactive and more respectful of animals both in the wild and on farms.

Various studies have also found the hug can help reduce blood pressure and heart rate levels. Matt Hertenstein, an experimental psychologist at DePauw University in Indiana, said: \"Oxytocin is a neuropeptide, which basically promotes feelings of devotion, trust and bonding. It really lays the biological foundation and structure for connecting to other people.A hug releases endorphins too Hugs can stimulate a particular set of nerves that trigger the release of endorphins - small molecules that are part of the bodys pain control system and produce an opiate-like analgesic effect. Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Oxford, said: ldquoBecause our feelings of psychological pain are processed in the same brain regions as our feelings of physical painhellipendorphins dampen our psychological pain. Thatrsquos why a hug is comforting when someone is in tears.It goes back to primates Professor Dunbar added of research he conducted: ldquoWe used a form of brain imaging known as positron emission tomographyto show that light stroking of the torso triggers a massive endorphin response in the human brain - just as grooming does in monkeys and apes.Not everyone will be ready, though As the vaccine programme continues its roll-out across the United Kingdom and the lockdown restrictions gradually ease, confidence grows, but not everyone will be feeling ready to jump back out into the world andto the way things were.So, when do you knowa hug is acceptable Dr Wendy Ross, the director of the Center for Autism and Neuroersity at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, told the New York Times a top tip is simply to ask: ldquoSome people like hugs, some donrsquot.

The discussion is an especially hard one to have on these British isles of ours. To say Scotland has \"dferent\" values to England is either heavy with anglophobia, or weighted with inferiority.We donrsquot shy away from assigning dfering values to other nations, though. France and its muscular secularism America and its love of the gun Australia and its scorn for social class. Each example, however, is a stereotype. Not all French are secularist many Americans hate guns there are plenty of Australian snobs.Over the last week, two events on the streets of Glasgow almost demanded that we discuss whether Scotland really does have values which dfer signicantly to the rest of the UK: the protest against immigration deportations in Pollokshields, and the disgraceful scenes of Rangers fans rampaging through the city.Letrsquos deal with Rangers first. Itrsquos easier to address values we donrsquot like. What happened ndash the thuggery, violence, sectarianism, destruction ndash has been condemned across society. Itrsquos indefensible. It disgraced the country. But it happened, and itrsquos happened before. There may only be a few thousands of these people in Scotland, but whether we like it or not, theyrsquore what the world saw at the weekend. They project an image of Scotland. We cannot escape that in the eyes of others wersquore blighted by sectarianism, and the hooliganism and intimidation that always accompany it. To those watching from outside Scotland, what happened in George Square represents\"Scottish values\", just as much as the football hooliganism of the s blighted the reputation of England as a whole on the worldrsquos stage.Read more: Dark forces of sectarianism have come to exploit independence and the UnionThe horrible irony is that we here, inside our own country, know that the vast majority of us reject such behaviour ndash that only a handful of the population behave like this. Yet to an outsider, wersquore all tarnished with it. Just as all Americans are seen,wrongly, as \"gun nuts\", we here in Scotland are being labelled, wrongly, in the eyes of other countries, as a nation where bigotry prospers. Scotlandrsquos shame, indeed.We may define ourselves in opposition to events like these however,we mean that, then we must prove it. To validate that \"value\" ndash the idea that sectarianism has no home here ndash we have to stamp out the little fires of sectarian hatred still burning around this country. Jail is a good fire extinguisher for sectarian thugs. Crippling fines a good fire retardant for those in authority who fail in their duty to society.The events in Pollokshields also tell a dferent story of Scotland, in comparison to the rest of the UK. With sectarianism, we share baggage with Ulster in our broad attitudes to immigration, though, we seem quite alone. Nowhere  in Britain would have been the site of such resistance to the Home Officersquos \"hostile environment\" policy. When one thousand people on the south side of Glasgow compelled Border Force officers to back down and prompted police to release two of their neighbours set for deportation, a clear iding line was established between \"Scottish\" and \"British\" values.What happened last week in Pollokshields was not a one-off. This country has a proud pedigree of showing respect and care for refugees, as long opposition to dawn raids and Dungavel detention centre proves.And here we get to the heart of this apparently dfering value between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Scotland is unique among most nations, itrsquos fair to say, on the issue of immigration. Brexit at its heart was an anti-immigration vote. Brexit didnrsquot appeal in Scotland. We didnrsquot vote to close our borders against outsiders. Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in Europe, was voting for peace and stability rather than expressing a pro-immigration position. A Pollokshields-style event is as unlikely in Ulster as it is in England. In UK terms, Scotland resembles those Democratic \"sanctuary cities\" during the Trump presidency.None of this is to say that there arenrsquot voters concerned about immigration in Scotland, or whorsquod like tighter restrictions. But immigration is ndash at least for the time being ndash a much less pressing political issue here than it is in England. Perhaps thatrsquos a legacy of decades-long dislike of the Tory Party, associated as it is with hardline anti-immigration policies. That antipathy may also account for Scotlandrsquos much more vocal opposition to austerity.Clearly, though, we also enjoy the luxury of opposition without responsibility. Itrsquos much easier to hate a policy when you donrsquot have to pass laws on it. Many Scots long opposed to British immigration policies, who also support the idea of an independent Scotland, have expressed worry at times thatwe ever do split with the UK, we might find our own liberal attitudes to immigration evaporating in some quarters.Immigration feels destined to become part of the constitutional debate. Only the foolish couldnrsquot envisage Project Fear II identying this social dference and exploiting the spectre of mass immigration.Read more: After the death of Mercy, Scots Government should break Westminster immigrationScotland is also at odds with Europe on immigration.

Germany without Angela Merkel may become a cold place for refugees. Italy has set a hard face against those seeking sanctuary.For the time being ndash in limbo as Scotland is, a nation without the powers of a nation ndash we can see that wersquore \"dferent\", although that dference offers both blessings and curses. Sectarianism, whether we like it or not, shows a Scottish face to the world.

Even those free of this tendency, however, may be tempted to mull over what there is to be said for it, since there isnrsquot much abroad abroad, as it were.There is the exciting ldquogreen list of about  countries that the UK government will let us travel to, though thatrsquos no guarantee that the countries themselves will. But the choice is limited. You can go to St Helena, the South Sandwich Islands and the Falklands, but in Europe your options are Iceland, Gibraltar or Portugal.:Boris Johnson is right: the rules donrsquot apply to him, by Andrew McKieNo doubt more places will go on the list as we get towards the summer, but there will still be some people hesitant about the wisdom of piling into a tube of recycled air and wall-to-wall strangers in order to get to some country where, on the EUrsquos record so far, most of the population wonrsquot be vaccinated.The experience of previous rises in coronavirus cases after the Easter and summer holidays last year may also lead some to think that it will be safer to stay in the UK. And the fact that countries that chose to close their borders and keep their economies open, rather than the other way round, seem to have had better results may be one reason why the UK government is slow in reopening travel.Though they will be worried about the airline industry, the authoritiesrsquo chief concern is probably encouraging tourists from other countries to come and spend their money here, rather than worrying too much about whether we can go to Torremolinos or Ayia Napa to spend our money there.Even those of us who are enthusiastic travellers sometimes forget how very recent such journeys are for most people. Many of us have got used to the idea that good weather, major landmarks and decent food are readily available within a couple of hours, often with a plane journey costing less than the anorak yoursquod need to buyyou were going to spend the summer in this country.But itrsquos only in the last  years that this has been an expectation for many people, and only really in the past  or so, since budget airlines became commonplace, that it has been readily affordable for almost everyone. One of my grandfathers, born in the centre of Glasgow, never travelled any further than the Isle of Wight, and Irsquom not sure the other one ever left the country, either.Even when I was growing up in the s, foreign travel was still relatively exotic: I was well into my teens before I went as far as England, and my sole experience of abroad was a single trip to northern France. I was  before I had been on an aeroplane, and my impression is that that wasnrsquot especially unusual in those days.Yet by the time my own children were teenagers, theyrsquod notched up visits to at least a dozen countries, partly because taking them abroad on holiday was usually a good deal cheaper than going somewhere in the UK. Vacations in Cornwall, the Scottish islands, rural Wales or the Norfolk coast now have more social cachet than going to Benidorm, and a price tag to match. While wersquore at it, the word ldquostaycation, which is so ugly it shouldnrsquot exist anyway, can only mean staying in your own house while yoursquore off work going anywhere  in the UK is a holiday, just not a foreign holiday.The fact that the UK attracts nearly  million foreign visitors a yearsuggests therersquos plenty to do here ndash therersquos hardly an international list of top destinations that you ought to visit that doesnrsquot have London in the top three, but the sheer ersity of British landscape and heritage more or less guarantees somewhere interesting to go.If you can afford it. Presumably British rental accommodation, hotels and holiday parks will be even more expensive this year,people canrsquot travel abroad, or are deterred from doing so, either on health grounds or because they may get saddled with an unexpected and expensive quarantine requirementanything changes while theyrsquore away. Itrsquos possible this will be a lasting trend, too.Therersquos growing disapproval, especially among environmentalists, of cheap plane travel ndash in fact, ordinary le having been shut down comprehensively is, it turns out, exactly what some environmentalists want, and quite a number of them have been proclaiming how much better everything is without travel, traffic, cities, restaurants or shops.:Andrew McKie: What can Starmer do to save Labour But it is also true that the growth in travel in recent decades has been happening at a time when there is less and less necessity to do it. You can always bring abroad to you. There are countless books, internet material and television programmes about almost every corner of the globe:you really wanted to, you could probably find out more about Vientiane or Mombasa or Port-au-Prince in a few hours online than you would by going to those places, without any of the cost, discomfort or time involved.The collections of almost all the worldrsquos important museums are available indigital form. The most exotic foods are available in every high street: in the s, olive oil was a specialist ingredient now your corner shop will sell you kaffir lime leaves, plantain or zarsquoatar.Therersquos just one element that canrsquot readily be provided: sun. At this time last year, the strictures of lockdown, still a relative novelty, were offset for a lot of us ndash or at least, those with access to the outdoors ndash by uncharacteristically good weather. May  was the sunniest calendar month on record, with much of the country having an average temperature of F.

The number of vehicles on a personal car lease is now double the amount just two years ago, according to industry body theBVRLA.It is overtaking traditional methods of car purchase, such as HP and PCP. With an HP deal the monthly repayments are usually very high, while PCPs - Personal Contract Purchase offers on new cars - are more complex due to the often-high initial deposit, followed by whether you should buy the car at the end of the term or hand it back because the value in the car has reduced too much or use any equity in the car as a deposit for a new car. Decisions, decisions!Thatrsquosnot the case with car leasing.Itrsquosfar simpler than that.First off, you never actually own the car but lease it - a long term rentalyou like - fora period of time. And that makes the monthly rentals more affordable.Ifyoursquorethe type of person that likes to lsquoownrsquo their car, consider that many drivers thatpurchasetheir car, donrsquot keepitforever. Many opt to tradethe carin for a newoneat some point,so evenlsquopurchasedrsquo cars are only used for a specic period. And of course, the process oftradingin comes withitsown hassles. Leasing removesthe complexityand makes jumping into an all-new car a simpler and more regular experience.The payments you make each month cover the cost of the car calculated on what it cost new and what its value will be at the end of your rental period. But this is what makes leasing so attractive. Youdonrsquothave to worry about the value - the funding company takes all that risk away from you. Allthatrsquosrequired of you is to drive the car for your agreed rental period, enjoy your choice of vehicle during that time, and then hand the car back at the end of your agreement. Is that simple, or what Itrsquosworth pointing out here that by making the lease agreement that simple, you also agree to hand the car back in a reasonable condition that is expected of a car at that age and mileage. You might not actually lsquoownrsquo thevehiclebut you still need to look after it as part of your contract.Butthatrsquosno dferent than looking after a car you might purchase.Second, with car leasing you need to decide how long you wish to drive the car for. The most popular terms which Intelligent Car Leasing has on its website are  months  months or  months.Generally speaking, thelonger the period, the lower the monthly rental payments will be. But you may decide that you want to swap your car more often, so  months would probably be a better choice.Third, you need to decide how many miles you want to drive each year. On the Intelligent Car Leasingsiteyou can simply configure the amount of miles you want to drive in the vehicle search bar, but we offer everything from  miles a year to a mega , miles. If you are uncertain,the friendlyleasingexpertsat Intelligent Car Leasing can help.If it helps, annual mileage is dropping to around  miles a year for personal leasing agreements, according to data from a comparison site, but the changes to lestyle following the pandemic may meanitrsquoslower as more people decide to work from home.Leasing offers many other benefits, such as road tax being included, thereby saving you even more money, anditrsquosworth pointing out that you can spec your preferred vehicle to your exact choosing.Andyoursquore considering an electric vehicle, leasing is byfar the best approachto ensure yoursquore neverstuck with outdated technology.Andthatrsquosit!All you need to understand about car leasing, made simple.

It had been expected by mid-April.While delivering its first quarter financial results, at the end of April, it emerged the company delivered  million doses of the vaccine to the European Union, United Kingdom and other countries in the first three months of the year.The company had said it was continuing to work on its application to USs Food and Drug Administration for emergency-use authorisation noting the ldquosubstantial size of the file\" that will include data from US trials as well all other studies completed so far and real-world data collected from use of the vaccine in other countries.It now looks extremely unlikely that Americans will get the AstraZeneca shot, even though the US had ordered  million doses of the vaccine in a  billion deal.The nation at the end of April was on track to have enough doses for every adult by the end of May with only the three already-authorized vaccines - Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson  Johnson.:Coronavirus vaccine: Under-s to be offered AstraZeneca alternative as latest blood clot data emergesJen Psaki, White House press secretary, said the new doses would go ldquoto help countries battling the pandemic.He added:ldquoWe are waiting for, of course, AstraZeneca, as you know, to go through the approval process of the FDA, but this will put  million doses out into the world by the end of June.\"Among issues that AstraZeneca would have had to address are indications that the vaccine was linked to rare blood clots, particularly in younger people.The India government on Monday said it identied  potential cases of bleeding and blood clotting due to the admnistration of the vaccine.Several countries recommended that the vaccine only be given only to older people because of the link to the rare clots - known as CVSTs .Last month the UKs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , which advises how vaccines should be used, recommended healthy people under  be offered a dferent vaccine.Vaccine experts say the blood clots are very rare and less than the blood clot risks of women taking birth control.They say that for the vast majority of people the benefits of the vaccine vastly outweighs the risks.By the end of April, according to the UK medical regulator, the MHRA,  cases were identied, and  people died.This was out of a total of more than  million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine which has been given in the UK at that time.Some believe AstraZeneca may skip asking the FDA for emergency-use authorisation and instead pursue the more time-intensive application for a full-fledged licence.Meanwhile Mexicos president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said last month that the country expects about another five million AstraZeneca doses from the US.Approximately . million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine was sent to Mexico from the US between late March and April.None of the additional  million doses that was due to be sent to other countries at the end of April had been available to ship immediately.Ten million had been filled into vials, awaiting regulatory safety testing.Another  million were expected to be produced between May and June.When AstraZeneca released data from its US vaccine trial on March , company officials said they expected to apply for FDA authorization in the first half of April.Once the application is filed, an FDA advisory committee will publicly debate the evidence behind the shots before the agency decides whether to allow emergency use.Ruud Dobber, an AstraZeneca executive vice president, said at the time thatthe FDA authorizes the vaccine, the company would deliver  million doses immediately, followed by another  million within the first month.The vaccine was developed by researchers at Oxford University, who licensed the technology to AstraZeneca in an effort to tap into the companyrsquos global manufacturing and distribution capacity. AstraZeneca in turn authorizes other companies to produce the shots around the world.More than .million people worldwide have died of COVID-, including more than , in the US.Mr Biden said in his vaccine announcement: \"Were taking an additional step, to help the world. We know America will never be fully safe until the pandemic thats raging globally is under control. No oceans wide enough. No walls high enough to keep us safe.\"Rampant disease and death in other countries can destabilize them, those countries and pose a risk to us as well. New iants could rise overseas that could put us at greater risk. And we need to help fight the disease around the world to keep us safe here at home and to do the right thing of helping other people. Its the right thing to do. Its the smart thing to do.\"Its the strong thing to do. In March, we shared over  million doses of our AstraZeneca vaccine with Canada and Mexico. At the end of April, we announced that we would provide another  million doses of our AstraZeneca vaccine overseas.\"Remember, this is the vaccine thats not authorized for use in the United States yet. So were going to be sending it to folks once the FDAs reviewed this and said its safe. This is all the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in the United States, all of it, will be sent to other countries.\"The latest data showed that % of American adults had received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose Biden has set a goal of getting % of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July .Many US allies had called on the Biden administration to send more vaccine doses to other countries, noting that the pandemic will not truly come to an end until vaccines are widely available around the world.Mr Biden said last week that almost half of the worldrsquos leaders had contacted his administration asking for help in getting access to more vaccine doses.\"We want to lead the world with our values, with this demonstration of our innovation and genuinity and the fundamental decency of the American people. Just as in World War II, America was the arsenal of democracy.

And we will not use our vaccines to secure favours from other countries. Well work with Kovack, the International organization set up, and other partners to ensure that the vaccines are living in a way that is equitable and that follows the science and the public health data.\"Todays announcement, to share  million doses, is our next step as we ramp up the efforts to respond to COVID- around the world.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-must-remove-john-swinney-education-secretary-say-labour","story":"The party accused Mr Swinney of overseeing \"a litany of failures\" and insistedhe had lost the confidence of staff across all parts of the sector.It said he had failed to close the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils as well as failing to manage the impact of the pandemic.Ms Sturgeon is expected to carry out a wide-ranging reshuffle after she is formally confirmed as First Minister later today.It comes after experienced ministers including former Health Secretary Jeane Freeman and Constitution Secretary Michael Russell stepped down at the Holyrood election.Scottish Labour education spokesman Michael Marra said: \"In five years as Education Secretary John Swinney has accrued a litany of failures to his name.\"Time and time again, he has failed to meet the challenge posed by the pandemic and has now led the pupils of Scotland into yet another exams crisis.\"But John Swinneyrsquos failings began before the pandemic.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby.

We did a huge amount of work including introducing a one-way system, social distancing measures and putting down markers,” said theatre manager Paul Baines. “One of the biggest challenges was getting people in and out safely.“We have to ensure the measures are genuine and effective and they are visible. Visible reassurance is important for customer confidence.“It is a juggling act because you have to balance creating a too clinical atmosphere with offering a unique theatre experience.”The theatre has been awarded the VisitEngland We’re Good to Go industry standard mark, signying that it adheres to government and public health COVID- guidance, also approved by UK Theatre Seat Safety.Alongside familiar COVID- safety measures, Rosie Fraser has introduced a new service called “Silent Treatment”.“We love a good chat but we also understand some people prefer not to,” said Rosie, whose beauty salon opened in .“Clients can see the service as soon as they look at the online booking menu and add it with whatever treatments they are having.“We still carry out a full consultation and then let them just relax.”Also in place are bespoke engraved screens between stations, extra time for cleaning, screening forms for track and trace, PPE and sanitising measures. Rosie emphasises that it is safety with style! Members of the seven-strong team are carrying out rapid COVID- tests at home thanks to the UK Government asymptomatic testing initiative.“We have exciting plans for this year in expanding.

The award-winning seafood restaurant extended its seating, installed outdoor heating and started a delivery service. Since reopening for outdoor dining, it has been doing a brisk trade bolstered by confidence in the vaccine programme. Reopening indoors is scheduled to start on May .“We created a dining room upstairs with a completely dferent feel,” said John, who owns the restaurant with his we Grainne. Safety processes include a digital thermometer mounted at the door which all staff and customers are required to pass before entering. Anyone recording a high temperature is refused admission.Hand sanitisers are also available. Kitchen and front of house staff are required to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Tables and chairs are cleaned rigorously after every diner. The restaurant’s commitment to the safety is also seen in its recognition as COVID- Compliant by Tourism NI.“If I could do cartwheels, I would” is one retail chief’s response to welcoming the public back.“When we saw the first trickle of people coming back last month, it was lovely,” enthused village location manager Meurig Jones. “Portmeirion needs people here.“It’s lovely but it isn’t what it should be without people appreciating it. It’s easier this year in that it was such a new thing when we opened in July.“We had to do a lot of work to train the staff into a new way of working. We’re constantly improving and we’re learning as we go on.”App orders and one-way systems will ensure ongoing safety. Outside seating, pods and marquee are also available. Misting machines, meanwhile, will keep hotels “squeaky clean – safe for staff and guests”.Meurig added: “There’s hand sanitiser outside every shop and we ask people to wear masks indoors, but not outside.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There followed four years of painful negotiation Theresa May was anointed, became a lame duck, and departed as PM to be replaced by Boris Johnson.Johnson saw off Jeremy Corbyn and ‘got Brexit done’ as he said he would, but post-Covid he might yet be done for himself. As rumours rage that in preference to lockdown he said he would tolerate a virus # from which he almost died # spreading so severely that bodies could “pile high on the streets”, there is a growing sense that the public reckoning he has long escaped may finally be in sight.Meanwhile in Scotland, having survived the ugly fall-out from of an investigation into the handling of sexual harassment complaints against her predecessor and political mentor Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon remains odds-on to become First Minister again in  # perhaps even with the overall majority she was unable to secure in .Whether victory leads to a second referendum depends not only on next week’s result but on whose ‘rights’ will take precedence in the eyes of the UK government who by law would need to sanction another vote.Because inescapably it is Covid-, how it is tackled and treated, and how we can recover as a country from it, that is the major issue facing all of us.It seems lamentable that, amid the constitutional flux and an increasing entrenchment of views, that there has been so little sign of a consensual approach – between both governments and parties # to steer the country away from the crisis.And that brings us back to the original point about the late Charles Kennedy.The landscape which he occupied has altered beyond recognition, but has changed politics meant better politics or brought improved outcomes  The jury is out, and it is a question voters should consider as they head for the booths.’ brought some encouraging news.Having seen the treatment Mr Kennedy received back in , the LibDems have called for a “a zero-tolerance approach to abuse and to lead a respectful campaign”.Their pledge calls for derogatory, untrue, or hateful messages on social media to be publicly denounced and challenged to treat political opponents and journalists with respect, and to run an honest campaign.The SNP, Tories, Labour and Greens – all of whom have members who have experienced threats and abuse in ious forms – have all signed up.It would be a fitting tribute to Charles Kennedythis is one electoral promise they can work together and fulfil."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Eoghan-MacLeod-scaled.jpg","title":"barra service superhub hundreds sign","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePublished on Monday, the petition has already gathered well over  signatures and was created by -year-old engine cadet Eoghan MacLeod from Vatersay.: “I started the petition to get a measure of how many people agreed with me that the hub plan as it stands needs big changes for it to meet the needs of the island.“I’d heard plenty of people in person talking about their concerns so I just put together what I’d heard and put it on the petition to seewe could make these concerns more visible.“My grandmother is currently in the old folks home at St Brendan’s as she has dementia and needs to be looked after around the clock. Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother. Replacing the old folks’ home with ‘social care flats’ would not be adequate for looking after my grandmother.”Mr MacLeod’s ‘Halt the Hub’ petition on the  degrees website is addressed to the comhairle, Scottish Government, SNP election candidate Alasdair Allan and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil.It states: “If the comhairle is going to spend £ million on a development on Barra they shouldn’t dismiss opinions expressed by the people living on Barra. The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3800606.jpg--.jpg?1620905531000\n","title":"beth backs foster fortnight with her deeds and words","story":"BALLYMENA Councillor Beth Adger can speak with some authority on the topic of fostering.Having fostered nearly  youngsters over two decades, she was the ideal person to voice Mid and East Antrim Council’s support for Foster Care Fortnight.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe case at the Royal Courts of Justice is expected to last five days In written arguments, Mr Coppel described the purchase of unusable PPE from the two companies as a “catastrophic waste of public funds”.Mr Coppel said approximately £ million was spent with PestFix and Ayanda, but it is not publicly known how much was spent on PPE which did not meet technical standards.He continued: “The defendant’s unlawful failure to carry out technical assurance on the products to be supplied by Pestfix and Ayanda led directly to the purchase of vast quantities of PPE which was unusable by the NHS, and so to a catastrophic waste of public funds.”The breakdown of the spending on each type of PPE or the amount paid in pre-payments by the Government to the companies has been kept confidential.The DHSC argued they are commercially sensitive and Mrs Justice O’Farrell found the specic pricing details were not relevant to what the court has to decide and did not need to be disclosed to the public.She said: “The case concerns the decision-making process carried out by the defendant … the precise level of the pricing or pre-payments or total amounts spent on PPE that might not have been used or fit for purpose are not relevant to the issues before the court.“It is not part of this court’s role to consider whether the contracts provided value for money or whether any public money has been wasted.”She added: “It is not necessary in my judgment for further details of the pricing of the contracts to be made public in these proceedings.”A large part of the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor’s claim is that the use of a “VIP lane” gave an unfair, unlawful advantage to some companies.Mr Coppel said the VIP lane was set up in late March , reserved for referrals from MPs, ministers and senior officials.The court heard that PestFix had supplied PPE for iniduals in pest control but had no experience in providing PPE for healthcare workers, and had net assets of around £,.Mr Coppel said PestFix was referred into the VIP lane because an ex-director of the company was an “old school friend” of the father in law of Steve Oldfield, the chief commercial officer at DHSC.He wrote: “The contracts secured by PestFix and Ayanda were directly attributable to their VIP status many other suppliers who had made credible offers of PPE but who were not fortunate enough to have connections in Government did not have their officers progressed.”The barrister said there was limited knowledge about the VIP lane which excluded many expert organisations.He continued: “National medical associations with expert knowledge, including the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing, were not told about the VIP lane and were therefore prevented from referring known PPE suppliers into it.”The Good Law Project and EveryDoctor argue that a VIP supplier was “more than  times as likely” to get a contract compared to a non-VIP supplier.Mr Coppel added: “The reality is clear: being a VIP supplier meantgetting a ‘foot in the door’, by your offer getting initial consideration by an official and thenbeing guided through the award process up to contract signature.“VIP suppliers’ offers were progressed through that process in a way that non-VIP suppliers’ were not.”DHSC is contesting the claim, which is being heard remotely and is expected to end on Tuesday next week..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and

It will attract tourists from around the world.”Mr Shaojun expects two to five million visitors per year, which, he expects, will guarantee aon the investors’ financial backing.However, the Titanic replica has not been welcomed by everyone.One said on social media that the Titanic is an “ominous ship” and questioned why anyone would spend , to stay for a night.Another said: “Replicating a ship from a deadly shipwreck, what an ‘interesting’ business plan.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland Protocol ‘legally rotten to the core’, High Court toldSDLP health spokesperson Cara Hunter apologises for breaching Covid guidance with weekend stay in Donegal Sleazy married NI cop had sex with woman on dutyRangers seeking legal advice over alleged ‘sectarian’ video police investigationGerry Adams will ‘avoid conviction’ over alleged involvement in Jean McConville murder, House of Lords hearsTop VideosPlayBobby Storey funeral takes place in west Belfast PlayUUP#s Doug Beattie to be next party leaderPlayNew DUP leader Edwin Poots# full interview with Sunday LeLatest WorldDarwin’s Arch in Galapagos Islands collapses due to erosionSpain and Morocco square-off after , migrants arrive in North Africa enclaveIndia reports record day of virus deaths as number of cases passes mIndia scours sea after barge sinks and second vessel adrt following cycloneIsrael and Hamas continue to trade fire in Gaza as war enters second weekLatestIrish Cup semi-finals LIVE: Updates as Larne take on Crusaders and Linfield face Ballymena United Steve Bruce delighted Newcastle fans are ing despite criticismDominic Cummings hits out at Government over coronavirus ‘catastrophe’The highs and lows of Roy Hodgson’s  years in managementLockdown easings – could the Indian iant derail the next step ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Applications were recently made for new bilingual street signs at Ballynagard Close and Elmvale. Once an application is made to Derry City and Strabane District Council, the council then writes to the residents in the streets to find out their views on the street sign application. Previously, from those who reply to the councils correspondence, a minimum of % of respondents had to support the new street sign proposal for it to be granted. However, in January of this year, the council agreed to reduce this threshold to %. The applications for new street signs at Ballynagard Close and Elmvale, however, were all based on the previous threshold. googletag.cmd.push In relation to Ballynagard Close, a total of  households were contacted in relation to the application. Of these households, four responded to the council. Three of the occupants who responded were in favour of the bilingual street sign, while one was against it. Therefore, this represents % of residents who responded being in support on the proposed new street sign. At Elmvale,  households were contacted by the council. Of these, responses were received back from  households. A total of % of the Elmvale households who responded were in support of the new street sign, with % opposed to it. googletag.cmd.push As a result, new bilingual street signs will now be erected by the council at both Ballynagard Close and Elmvale. Januarys decision by the council to reduce the bilingual street sign threshold from % to % was criticised by unionist councillors. They described it as a backwards step for cross community relations in the local area.

To mark the milestone, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Brian Tierney, has revealed that the local council will be covering the cost of the playing pitches for the season. Mayor Tierney attended the launch of the event at Clooney Park Weston Monday night where the gesture was announced that he would pay for approximately  games between the teams who have registered for the league’s centenary year. Speaking at the event, which took place before the game between Foyle Harps and Lisahally,he praised the network of volunteers who have helped bring the league to this signicant milestone and wished the teams well in their bid to have the distinction of winning the centenary league title. googletag.cmd.push “The Derry and District League has played a central role in community of le for a century now offering recreation and a  for footballers to express themselves,” he said. “Some of the best players to come out of the city cut their teeth in the league including Liam Coyle, Paddy McCourt and more recently Shane Duffy and Aaron McEneff who benefited from the chance to play against men in their formative years. “The league is completely amateur and the games are only made possible by the dedication of the network of volunteers who look after the signicant administration required to run it from booking pitches and referees to organising fixtures and tables. googletag.cmd.push “I would have loved the opportunity to recognise that dedication in the form of a civic reception at the Guildhall however I hope my covering of the cost of the pitches will go some way towards making up for that disappointment.” League Spokesperson,Christy McGeehan, thanked the Mayor for his gesture. This is a great gesture from Mayor Tierney and shows that Council value the central role the league has played in the Derry community over the years, he said. We are delighted with the high number of clubs who have registered for this years league and hopefully the centenary year will mark a resurgence for the league as numbers have been lower in recent years.

To mark the milestone, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Brian Tierney, has revealed that the local council will be covering the cost of the playing pitches for the season. Mayor Tierney attended the launch of the event at Clooney Park Weston Monday night where the gesture was announced that he would pay for approximately  games between the teams who have registered for the league’s centenary year. Speaking at the event, which took place before the game between Foyle Harps and Lisahally,he praised the network of volunteers who have helped bring the league to this signicant milestone and wished the teams well in their bid to have the distinction of winning the centenary league title. googletag.cmd.push “The Derry and District League has played a central role in community of le for a century now offering recreation and a  for footballers to express themselves,” he said. “Some of the best players to come out of the city cut their teeth in the league including Liam Coyle, Paddy McCourt and more recently Shane Duffy and Aaron McEneff who benefited from the chance to play against men in their formative years. “The league is completely amateur and the games are only made possible by the dedication of the network of volunteers who look after the signicant administration required to run it from booking pitches and referees to organising fixtures and tables. googletag.cmd.push “I would have loved the opportunity to recognise that dedication in the form of a civic reception at the Guildhall however I hope my covering of the cost of the pitches will go some way towards making up for that disappointment.” League Spokesperson,Christy McGeehan, thanked the Mayor for his gesture. This is a great gesture from Mayor Tierney and shows that Council value the central role the league has played in the Derry community over the years, he said. We are delighted with the high number of clubs who have registered for this years league and hopefully the centenary year will mark a resurgence for the league as numbers have been lower in recent years.     We have a thriving underage league and I am delighted that more of the clubs are now fielding a senior mens team as it keeps more young players involved in the game and the opportunities and pathways it offers them to develop.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, which aired this week on BBC One. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable. I am so privileged that we get to go on this journey together as mother and daughter. “We are bursting with pride.” Three Families is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There was a lot of great stuff in the NDNA on areas like health, legacy and the Irish language. We really do need to make progress on them but many people across Ireland and the UK are now reimagining what the future should be like. We have been locked down and our lives on pause for almost  months. During that time, we have seen both the Irish and British government dig deep and find billions to effectively underwrite both economies. googletag.cmd.push I wrote over a year ago that the failure by the UK Government to intervene and shore up the economy would lead to a total collapse of the economy in the UK and society. In my opinion both governments had no choice but to dig deep and borrow. Now before we all get sentimental and fuzzy, they effectively borrowed money which WE will pay back to keep both countries from imploding. We are all effectively covering the loan. Its us on the hook. This huge intervention however demonstrates how governments when they need to, are willing to intervene. Im always reminded of the time Theresa May told a nurse who hadnt had a pay rise in eight years that there isn’t a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want. googletag.cmd.push Well Boris has mysteriously found a forest full of money trees. The Office for Budget Responsibilityreckons the UK has borrowed over poundbn in  . It will be poundbn in  . This is the highest ever seen outside wartime. In the words of Ted Hastings Jesus Mary and Joseph and the Wee Donkey! That will be poundbn+ in  years. Where have the Austerity Brothers George Osborne and David Cameron gone  Cameron has his own problems but Osborne is still bleating the balance the books mantra from the sidelines. I cant see that anytime soon. So, post Covid- what can we expect      Well for one thing Covid- has hit society in a way not seen since WW. I am old enough to remember the recession of the s and this is much worse than that. In the USA, President Biden has come out of the stalls clearly indicating that he wants to pump prime the economy with a major overhaul of decaying infrastructure. Its been hailed by many as a version of the post Great Depression New Deal delivered by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It really got the US back on its feet. Many across the island of Ireland are looking for a new normal. Of course, we all want to get rid of masks and go for a pint etc. but to slide back into a society driven by economic greed isnt as appealing any more. A lot has changed. The last  months has put many sectors in the spotlight. We have all clapped for health workers and carers but prior to all this, their pay and conditions didnt really interest us so much. This was the same for many of the jobs which during the Covid crisis became frontline. Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, cleaners and the people stocking the shelves of our supermarkets. Now, most of us appreciate the role they do and their pay and conditions matter more to us than ever. Without these people risking their lives and long term health society would have collapsed. Most of them didnt have the option to work remotely. They showed up and took care of the sick. They scrubbed down rooms or beds where Covid patients had been.  The point is they showed up and we now have a chance to reset our society and replace the clapping with a better salary. For me,it means a bit extra in tax, Im happy to pay it. Now when I see - Deliveroo drivers waiting outside a Take-away for a job I cant help but feel sorry for their plight. Before I was oblivious to it but now, I see just how unfair society has got. Some person designs an algorithm and sits in Calornia and earns billions while a delivery drivergets minimum wage. Many are now calling for a social revolution across society. Ive heard build back better and build back stronger bandied about like snuff at a wake but it makes perfect sense. In Derry, we have saw throughout this crisis a number of community organisations across the city step up and work in partnership with DCSDC and central government. Their roots are in the community and without their involvement during Covid- many more people would have died or slipped deeper into poverty. We really need to build on that. For me, there needs to be a major rethink at central and local government level on how we deliver the recovery. A cornerstone for this needs to be a recognition of the important role the community and voluntary sector play. We must mobilize these communities and connect with them and most importantly invest in them. If local or central government want to do community planning then invest real money in it and forget these detailed desk based action plans which often have no resources behind them but look great on a PowerPoint. And when you think about it who is best placed to help young people within some of our most disadvantaged get jobs. We have had an economic policy for the last  years which mixes encouraging and supporting indigenous businesses whilst attracting Foreign Direct Investment . Its had some success but it hasnt taken Derry off the top of the unemployment league for the North. There are quite a few other communities it has failed. Its now time to recognise that empowering organisations within these communities and backing them financially is the way to see jobs and a better society. And how do we do it  Within the North I would empower the Department of Communities and give it the budget to deliver it. They could jointly deliver this with Invest NI through the Department for Economy. That would be the best model for delivery. I would also put social enterprise and its promotion on a par across the island. There is no reason why more of our young people keen to start a business wouldnt decide on this structure. All the social enterprises I know make profits. Its what they do with these profits which is dferent. They reinvest in the staff and community instead of paying idends. Many others use profits to provide vital services in their communities. Many young people are already starting social enterprises and others are seeing a career working in a social enterprise in a dferent light. The biggest problem is that most people think social enterprises are confined to a sector. Theyre not. It’s more a way of doing a business rather than a specic sector. We have one chance to get this right as hopefully Covid is a once in a letime event. Already initiatives like Buy Social from the Department of Finance are recognising social capital in all their tenders. We need to do more, however. Lets not go back to the old normal because lets face it, things were not so great. President Harry Truman attempted a New Deal in the USA after WW. His  point plan which included developing a US version of the NHS and many other things failed. He also wanted to increase minimum wage and tackle some of the civil rights issues still visible in the US.It failed and most of the  objectives where never met. Lets hope we can learn from Covid and unlike President Harry Truman deliver a fair deal to everyone in society. Trickledown economics is a myth folks and its time we value people and work with our communities here to build a fairer society.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There was a lot of great stuff in the NDNA on areas like health, legacy and the Irish language. We really do need to make progress on them but many people across Ireland and the UK are now reimagining what the future should be like. We have been locked down and our lives on pause for almost  months. During that time, we have seen both the Irish and British government dig deep and find billions to effectively underwrite both economies. googletag.cmd.push I wrote over a year ago that the failure by the UK Government to intervene and shore up the economy would lead to a total collapse of the economy in the UK and society. In my opinion both governments had no choice but to dig deep and borrow. Now before we all get sentimental and fuzzy, they effectively borrowed money which WE will pay back to keep both countries from imploding. We are all effectively covering the loan. Its us on the hook. This huge intervention however demonstrates how governments when they need to, are willing to intervene. Im always reminded of the time Theresa May told a nurse who hadnt had a pay rise in eight years that there isn’t a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want. googletag.cmd.push Well Boris has mysteriously found a forest full of money trees. The Office for Budget Responsibilityreckons the UK has borrowed over poundbn in  . It will be poundbn in  . This is the highest ever seen outside wartime. In the words of Ted Hastings Jesus Mary and Joseph and the Wee Donkey! That will be poundbn+ in  years. Where have the Austerity Brothers George Osborne and David Cameron gone  Cameron has his own problems but Osborne is still bleating the balance the books mantra from the sidelines. I cant see that anytime soon. So, post Covid- what can we expect      Well for one thing Covid- has hit society in a way not seen since WW. I am old enough to remember the recession of the s and this is much worse than that. In the USA, President Biden has come out of the stalls clearly indicating that he wants to pump prime the economy with a major overhaul of decaying infrastructure. Its been hailed by many as a version of the post Great Depression New Deal delivered by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It really got the US back on its feet. Many across the island of Ireland are looking for a new normal. Of course, we all want to get rid of masks and go for a pint etc. but to slide back into a society driven by economic greed isnt as appealing any more. A lot has changed. The last  months has put many sectors in the spotlight. We have all clapped for health workers and carers but prior to all this, their pay and conditions didnt really interest us so much. This was the same for many of the jobs which during the Covid crisis became frontline. Delivery drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, cleaners and the people stocking the shelves of our supermarkets. Now, most of us appreciate the role they do and their pay and conditions matter more to us than ever. Without these people risking their lives and long term health society would have collapsed. Most of them didnt have the option to work remotely. They showed up and took care of the sick. They scrubbed down rooms or beds where Covid patients had been.  The point is they showed up and we now have a chance to reset our society and replace the clapping with a better salary. For me,it means a bit extra in tax, Im happy to pay it. Now when I see - Deliveroo drivers waiting outside a Take-away for a job I cant help but feel sorry for their plight. Before I was oblivious to it but now, I see just how unfair society has got. Some person designs an algorithm and sits in Calornia and earns billions while a delivery drivergets minimum wage. Many are now calling for a social revolution across society. Ive heard build back better and build back stronger bandied about like snuff at a wake but it makes perfect sense. In Derry, we have saw throughout this crisis a number of community organisations across the city step up and work in partnership with DCSDC and central government. Their roots are in the community and without their involvement during Covid- many more people would have died or slipped deeper into poverty. We really need to build on that. For me, there needs to be a major rethink at central and local government level on how we deliver the recovery. A cornerstone for this needs to be a recognition of the important role the community and voluntary sector play. We must mobilize these communities and connect with them and most importantly invest in them. If local or central government want to do community planning then invest real money in it and forget these detailed desk based action plans which often have no resources behind them but look great on a PowerPoint. And when you think about it who is best placed to help young people within some of our most disadvantaged get jobs. We have had an economic policy for the last  years which mixes encouraging and supporting indigenous businesses whilst attracting Foreign Direct Investment . Its had some success but it hasnt taken Derry off the top of the unemployment league for the North. There are quite a few other communities it has failed.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change.

Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run.

If Mr Poots moves suddenly to remove her, that could be her final time facing questions to the first minister.Yesterday morning one of the incoming DUP leader’s closest allies, fellow Lagan Valley Assemblyman Paul Givan, said that Mr Poots had “made it clear that he wanted to engage with his colleagues in the Assembly before he would take decisions around ministerial appointments.“And indeed this is going to be a much more comprehensive overhaul of the Assembly team because he is looking at every position – chairs of committees, vice-chairs of committees, and indeed Policing Board membership.“Edwin’s focus is on engaging with colleagues he always has wanted the best people to populate those positions and that’s what he’s going to do.”Speaking on Good Morning Ulster, Mr Givan said he had not asked for any position in the Executive. It had ben reported that Mr Givan was lined up to be first minister, but two sources close to Mr Poots said that was inaccurate.Over the weekend, talk within the DUP was of North Antrim MLA Mervyn Storey as a possible first minister.When askedMrs Foster should leave earlier than she would like, Mr Givan said that Mr Poots wanted to have a team in place “to hit the ground running”.However, he insisted that the new leader was “sensitive that when change takes place...that’s something that has to be handled sensitively”.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Located at the busy junction of Dromore Road and James Street, the store will occupy an entire space of , sq. metres – more than double the size of its existing store – which will include an expansive sales floor of , sq. metres. The planning application lodged with Fermanagh and Omagh District Council will see the demolition of a neighbouring pub and private dwelling to make way for the expansion on a site that will also incorporate a-space car park with two electric vehicle charging points and new, complementary landscaping. Construction plans encompass Lidl Northern Ireland’s bold ‘concept’ design which prioritises sustainability, spacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms, employee and baby-changing facilities which will dramatically enhance a high-quality shopping experience. The site will also include a large warehouse and improved employee welfare facilities. The application follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in September  which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community. Conor Boyle, regional director for Lidl Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to confirm plans for a replacement store in Omagh which will see the existing store at James Street in the town double in size to provide a dramatically-enhanced shopping experience and new jobs for the area. Centrally located in the west of the region, the Omagh store serves a burgeoning and thriving community base and is conveniently positioned next to the A which is a major primary route and commuter corridor. As a major investor in our communities and in our local economy, the Omagh store is an important location for us, and I am thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to the local area as part of this multimillion-pound investment.
