         Calling for a second referendum, Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, said a decision \u0027needs to be taken\u0027    The chances of Brexit will be no more than 50-50 if MPs vote down Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal deal, pro-Leave minister Liam Fox (pictured in Downing Street earlier this month) has saidInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May\u0027s deal would be \u0027incendiary\u0027 and said it was \u0027a matter of honour\u0027 for them to support the PM.MPs are due to vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in the week of January 7 after Mrs May, facing the prospect of a significant defeat, pulled the original date of December 11.However the bid to buy more time to secure key concessions on the Irish backstop, the key flashpoint for DUP and Brexiteer detractors of the deal, appeared to falter when her fellow leaders refused to change the legal text of the agreement.The PM said talks would continue, although the EU has repeatedly warned negotiations over the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Should MPs reject it when they vote in the coming weeks it could raise the prospect of no-deal and with it the risk of heavy economic consequences for the UK and EU, or a second referendum on Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Government cannot renege on Brexit   Sir Keir Starmer insisted Labour MPs would not be forced into accepting Theresa May´s deal in order to prevent a no-deal scenario Sir Keir went on to pay tribute to Tory MPs such as Nick Boles and Anna Soubry, who said they would resign the whip if the Government did pursue a no deal, adding: \u0027I suspect they\u0027re not alone.\u0027 Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd insisted she did not want a so-called People\u0027s Vote and did not think the country wanted to be asked again for its views on Brexit.But she backed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to back if Theresa May\u0027s deal is rejected when it returns to Parliament for a crunch vote in January.  Tory and Labour MPs to force Brexit delay if May\u0027s deal is voted down | Politics | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Herd seven elephants leave guards stunned march residential compound India","story":"    The elephants can be seen casually walking down a dirt path between houses and gardens in Coimbatore, India  They tear a few branches from trees and toss them into the road and inspect a residents back garden as they wander through the villageThey tear a few branches from trees and toss them into the road and inspect a residents back garden as they wander through the village.But the herd appear to be just passing through and later wander off back they way that they came. Tragedy as three-week-old elephant without a name dies at...Why all you\u0027ve been told about these polar bears could be...Share this articleResidents were reportedly stunned by the elephants after they strolled through their street.And later the elephants reportedly stormed a banana plantation and damaged crop, according to local media. People have complained against the threat to their lives as the wild elephants frequently wander through the residential area, local media reported.           But the herd appear to be just passing through and later wander off back they way that they came"},{"url":null,"title":"Couple spend 10 months 2 000 building 10ft Lego wall","story":"    Janet Turford, 43, and Alan Wilkinson, 50, from Pontypool in South Wales, hoped to \u0027jazz up\u0027 their games room and joked they could use their beloved Lego to build a life-sized wall, which is seen here completed in this undated image Finished and stuffed with quirky characters, secret doors and Lego men - the couple have dubbed the finished project as suitably \u0027awesome\u0027.Ms Turford said: \u0027It was a labour of love but it took 10 months because we did it as and when we could after work and at weekends - just whenever we had a little free time to fill.\u0027We\u0027ve got a games room with a pool table and karaoke and lots of different quirky bits, a dartboard and everything.\u0027Santa Claus doesn\u0027t come to naughty kids\u0027: The mum who...Boxing Day sales to start on December 23 in desperate bid to...Share this article\u0027We had the space above the bar that needed filling. It was just plain. We were just trying to figure out how we could jazz it up and we both love Lego so came up with the idea of building an interactive wall that our friends and family could enjoy along with us.\u0027What began as a \u0027bit of a silly joke\u0027 quickly turned into something bigger.Ms Turford said: \u0027It seemed like quite a small and easy project at first but we massively underestimated how many bricks it took to even complete one line so quickly found ourselves scouting around for more.  Ms Turford and Mr Wilkinson (left) stuffed the wall with quirky characters, secret doors and Lego men (right) \u0027We didn\u0027t plan it. It just happened as we did it row by row. We wanted it to be as natural as possible so tried not to think about the colours we were putting together as we wanted it to stay childlike and naive.\u0027The couple have had several parties this year and were surprised about how enthusiastic people could be about the feature.\u0027It\u0027s a talking point, definitely. It\u0027s massively taken us by surprise how appreciative and enthusiastic people are about it,’ Ms Turford said.          The couple with a box of Lego next to their giant wall \u0027I really thought people would just see it as a wall of bricks and funky bits on it but people genuinely think it\u0027s a brilliant creation.\u0027You just don\u0027t think that many people are going to appreciate something you\u0027ve done so it is very humbling.\u0027Especially when it\u0027s a personal thing and it\u0027s a project you\u0027ve done yourself and put out there. It\u0027s gone a bit bonkers.\u0027The couple sought out the thousands of bricks used in the wall at car boot sales, auction houses and through online sellers - but became frustrated at how quickly they got through them.They say they have no idea how much they spent in total - but gave an estimate of a couple of thousand pounds.And in true Lego spirit, the couple think their creation is \u0027awesome\u0027 and routinely sing the Lego theme song \u0027Everything is Awesome\u0027.Ms Turford said: \u0027I love it all. I love the men in little holes. I love my JCB man and my criminal escaping down a ladder with a policeman at the top.\u0027I love our little robot that we made the night before because there was a hole that needed filling so we made him out of pieces to make a robot. There\u0027s so many different things. I just love it all.\u0027It\u0027s awesome. It is awesome. But it\u0027s because we loved doing it.

It has always been assumed that the Queen (pictured in front of the Britannia in 1983) would never put pressure on the government over an issue which was very politically sensitive at the timeIn 2003, a place spokesman told The Sunday Telegraph: \u0027Neither the Queen nor the Duke of Edinburgh have ever expressed an opinion on the way the issue was handled and nor would they do so.\u0027Yet writing to Richard Williams, a civil servant attached to the Cabinet Office, Sir Kenneth, who died in February, made clear the monarch’s interest in discussions about a replacement.He added that he hoped the ideas would be discussed in terms of feasibility first, and cost, second.‘It would not, I suggest, be a sufficient answer to all those who have contributed ideas to say simply that there is no spare money in the defence budget’, he insisted.          In an extremely rare public show of emotion, Her Majesty shed a tear on the day she had to finally bid farewell to a ship that had served her family for over forty yearsThe senior official also revealed that Prince Philip’s suggestion at the time was apparently to use parts of the Britannia in a new vessel.Professor Murphy, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, told the publication that the letter, in his belief, clearly shows that behind the scenes of the palace, ‘discrete pressure’ was being put on Whitehall to come up with a ‘positive proposal’.The idea to replace Britannia became an election issue in 1997, with Tony Blair’s Labour opposing the idea.Since then there have been numerous attempts to campaign for a new vessel, with 50 Tory MPs last year suggesting a special national lottery to raise the £120million needed for a new Royal Yacht.Britannia is now a tourist attraction in Leith, Edinburgh.           Britannia  (pictured in 1985) is now a tourist attraction in Leith, EdinburghI want a new yacht, Queen told Whitehall in secret letter | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Netflix announcement 45M accounts watched Bird Box met widespread skepticism","story":"    Netflix\u0027s \u0027Bird Box\u0027 has been watched by a record-breaking 45 million accounts in the week since it was released, the streaming service announced in a tweet on Friday.

It is also a reminder that it was not just the castle that was involved in the siege the surrounding town must also have taken a battering.\u0027Experts have been intrigued by the latest discovery at the castle where around 23 different siege attempts have been attempted over the centuries.          The stone ball is thought to have been launched from a powerful medieval catapult during a siege of Edinburgh Castle (pictured above)John Lawson, City of Edinburgh Council archaeologist, said: \u0027It looks like the type of ball which would have been fired by a trebuchet, one of the most powerful catapults used in the Middle Ages.\u0027Worldwide, the most famous account of a trebuchet is that of Warwolf, the giant catapult used by Edward I\u0027s army at Stirling Castle in 1304.          Edinburgh Castle (pictured above) was captured in 1296 by Edward IIn order to bolster the castle\u0027s defences, master craftsmen were brought it from Wales.One of the main reasons for Edward I taking the castle was for the riches inside it. During the siege royal regalia, state records and other treasures belonging to Edinburgh Castle were taken to London along with the Stone of Destiny from Scone Abbey, which is often referred to as the Coronation Stone.             The Stone of Destiny arriving at Edinburgh Castle On Christmas Day 1950, four Scottish students removed the stone from Westminster Abbey in London. It then turned up three months later  500 miles away – at the front door of Arbroath Abbey.In 1996, the stone was finally returned to Scotland after an ongoing feud with the UK regarding its heritage.It now sits in the Crown Room in Edinburgh Castle where hundreds of thousands of visitors que up to see it every year.   The stone will only leave Scotland again when there is a coronation in Westminster Abbey.                                                        "},{"url":null,"title":"Kensington Palace releases favourite moments 2018","story":"    A pregnant Kate Middleton is shown in January visiting school children at the start of the videoThe Firm Front!

The whole stereotyping is disgraceful. It’s the same kind of stereotyping you would have seen in anti-Semitic literature before the war about Jews cheating in business. I find it really alarming.’But Toby Young said: ‘The people shouting “racist” are nearly always white, privately educated Lefties who’ve appointed themselves moral guardians.

For reasons that remain unknown, he was without his rifle.           According to scientists, three of Canada’s 13 bear sub-populations are in decline, including West Hudson Bay. However, a new Nunavut government bear management plan cites TEK from Inuit communities that contradict this: they say none of the bear populations are shrinking, while nine are increasingThe bear pounced, and while his 12-year-old daughter desperately radioed for help, Aaron was mauled to death.His friend William Tiktaq, 32, told me: ‘That evening, I was in the party that recovered his body. I put a tarp on top of him in the boat, so the salt water wouldn’t get to him. He was badly mauled. There were bites everywhere. It’s not a sight you want to see.’Six months later Aaron’s death, the first fatal attack by a polar bear in the Hudson Bay area for 19 years, is still a raw and emotional wound, described with sadness and horror by everyone I met. Its impact was intensified by a second mauling in August, when a mother bear and a cub attacked a group of three Inuit hunters near Naujaat, 500 miles to the north, killing Darryl Kaunak.‘These deaths have been a blow to the whole community – all of us are in shock,’ Evelyn Qasuk, 43, a mother of four children, told me. ‘It makes me nervous about my kids walking around outside the house. So who is right – the scientists and campaigners or what the Nunavut government calls Inuit ‘TEK’ – traditional ecological knowledge? Despite the bears’ iconic status, it is impossible to give a definitive answer.Scientists use two main methods to estimate the changing size of polar bear sub-populations: ‘mark and recapture’, which requires bears to be tranquillised and tagged, and aerial surveys. But both have huge margins of error.According to scientists, three of Canada’s 13 bear sub-populations are in decline, including West Hudson Bay. However, a new Nunavut government bear management plan cites TEK from Inuit communities that contradict this: they say none of the bear populations are shrinking, while nine are increasing. Meanwhile, a study published in 2016 revealed past cases where TEK and scientists disagreed about bear sub-populations – and claimed the Inuit were eventually proven right.Moreover, if the West Hudson bears have declined recently, this may have nothing to do with sea ice. Since 1979, the long-term trend in ice across the Arctic is down.But in Hudson Bay, a paper by Prof Derocher and others suggests that although the sea is frozen for three weeks less than in the 1980s, this has not got worse since 2001. Meanwhile, the latest survey of the Chukchi Sea, between Russia and Alaska, where there has been a marked decline in sea ice recently, says it has a stable and healthy sub-population of bears.A wild year! 2018 was the ‘most remarkable’ in decades for...A new Beast from the East could be on the way: Met Office...Share this articleThis year, the sea froze around Arviat unusually early: the bay was covered by mid-October. But Ikhakik says: ‘I saw bears out on the ice, hunting for seals one day – and then at the dump round here the next.’ This may be the key to their survival. The Inuit say they have seen bears catching Arctic char, the large local fish, while swimming in open water, and even seals. There is also food on land – including the tern eggs.‘South of Arviat there is a lot of geese, for miles and miles – one big food source for bears,’ says Kidlapik. ‘They are very smart animals. As the seasons change, bears change their habits, just like people do.’Moreover, the Inuit say the bears’ status as climate change pin-ups helps explain why they have lost their fear of humans.Churchill, in Manitoba, 200 miles to the south, is the world’s most accessible polar bear viewing spot. Served by jets from Winnipeg, it has become the focus of a lucrative bear tourist industry, with ‘tundra buggies’ taking thousands of visitors annually to see the ‘threatened’ bears. Sometimes, they are even allowed to touch them through steel fences. Many in Arviat are marked with green or purple paint spots, which means they have migrated from Churchill.Joe Savikataaq, the Nunavut territory premier and its environment minister, happens to live in Arviat. ‘Polar bear tourism is contributing to our problem,’ he said. ‘Because the media and other organisations are convinced there will soon be no more bears because of climate change, these are the most studied bears in the world. Yet traditional Inuit knowledge says they are becoming more numerous and more aggressive.’One solution, he has said, may be to increase the quota of permitted kills – which at present, for the West Hudson Bay, is just 28. This, a demand being voiced by several Inuit communities, would be controversial: ‘The government of Nunavut feels so much outside pressure because of climate change, when the world seems to think the bears are about to die out.’Drikus Gissing, director of Wildlife Management for Nunavut’s environment department for the past 14 years, said: ‘We have exceeded the humanbear tolerance level. It has become a public safety issue.           Mail on Sunday reporter David Rose in Hudson Bay, Canada. He wrote: \u0027Last week, Arviat’s minimum temperature hit minus 36C. However, as I rapidly discovered, its people – who are almost all Inuit – are as warm as its weather is brutal\u0027In other countries, they would be hunted. But people argue the Inuit should be willing to live with these animals. The communities are very upset. At every meeting we’ve been to this year, people said it’s not true they’re declining, they’re increasing, as at Arviat.’Gissing adds: ‘These bears are in good condition. Our biologists say they are doing fine. I’ve heard of reporters trying to film skinny bears and they can’t find them. You will always find skinny animals in any population. But when you look at the teeth of the bears that are skinny, they are usually very worn, from old age. That’s a good sign: it means the animals can die naturally.‘I don’t think that climate change is the main factor determining polar bear health and population size. I feel a lot of biologists are scared to say this because they are frightened of being labelled deniers.’Even Prof Derocher, who is convinced the bears’ long-term future is bleak, accepts that ‘the wheels are not coming off yet’, while ‘some bear populations are doing fine’.In West Hudson Bay, there has been ‘a recent period of stability’, he says, and though ‘we were seeing starving bears, starving cubs on land, that seems to have slowed down’. Then again, the computer models ‘are not great on the five to ten year time-frame’, and it was possible that, although the Arviat bears might look healthy now, they may be about to ‘fall off a cliff’.As my plane took off from Arviat just before ten in the morning, the sun was a pale red semi-circle piercing the icy horizon. A thought struck me.Climate computer models say sea ice will continue to decline. Yet polar bears have been around for some 400,000 years, some of them warmer than today: about 100,000 years ago birch trees grew on Baffin Island, and summer temperatures, scientists say, were 4C to 5C warmer than at present. Activists claim that polar bears are ‘the canary in the coalmine’ that proves how dangerous climate change is, not only to bears but humans. But what if they chose the wrong species? And if the scientists are wrong about the bears, will it be only the Inuit who become more sceptical?"},{"url":null,"title":"Foreign Office reveals strangest questions staff asked","story":"    The Foreign and Commonwealth Office yesterday released a list of some of the stranger questions its staff had to field this yearThey included:A man enquiring if there were vampires in Poland because a woman he met online had asked what blood type he was before they met for their first date. A caller in the US asking which contestant had been voted off Strictly Come Dancing the previous night.The Trumps arrive back in Washington after making a SECOND...Canadian citizen faces trial in China for smuggling \u0027an...Share this articleA man asking if the FCO could provide a list of women in Argentina whom he might be able to marry.In other offbeat requests, embassy staff in Rome took a call from someone asking them to help arrange a wedding, recommend a florist and get tickets to see the Pope. And further afield, one holidaymaker beseeched mandarins to speak to a massage parlour in Bangkok on his behalf as he had fallen asleep during a massage and felt that he shouldn’t have to pay for it.

Humphrys wondered whether Dimbleby’s poshness helped him maintain close ties to the royal family. “There’s a typical sneer in that question,” Dimbleby retorted.Whether coming from Wales is sufficient protection against poshness is a moot point. Dimbleby was educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. His second wife, Belinda Giles, is the granddaughter of an earl. His son Henry attended Eton (at the same time as Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg). That’s not exactly an unprivileged background.Privilege, though, is a quality that desires not to speak its name. No one wants to have their accomplishments attributed to their background. Talent and hard work, we like to believe, are the brokers of success in a meritocracy.So entrenched as a social aspiration has meritocracy become that we often forget that the term was coined in mockery. In his 1958 satire, The Rise of Meritocracy, the sociologist Michael Young told of a society in which classes were sorted not by the hereditary principle but by the formula IQ + Effort  Merit.In this new society, “the eminent know that success is a just reward for their own capacity”, while the lower orders deserve their fate. Having been tested again and again and “labelled ‘dunce’ repeatedly”, they have no choice but “to recognise that they have an inferior status”.Young’s dystopian meritocracy doesn’t (yet) exist, but we have something perhaps worse: the pretence of a meritocracy. The pretence that talent will achieve its just rewards in a society in which class distinctions continue to shape educational outcomes, job prospects, income and health.But if class still determines social fate, the cleavage between the elite and the masses has been remade. Today’s elite is no longer the “establishment” of old, nor primarily defined through aristocratic heredity. Education has become a primary marker of social difference.As western societies have become more technocratic, so there has developed, the political scientist David Runciman observed, “a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite” – bankers, lawyers, doctors, civil servants, pundits, academics. Once knowledge has become “a prerequisite of power, then it no longer speaks for itself” but “appears to speak for the worldview of the people who possess it”.Education, in other words, has come to be a marker of the values one holds and the place one possesses in society. One of the key signifiers of attitudes to Donald Trump and to Brexit is education.Today, we simultaneously deride poshness and want to be seen as having the common touch (hence Dimbleby’s outrage at being called posh), while also showing contempt for those who are deemed too common and whose commonness exhibits itself in the refusal to accept the wisdom of expertise and in being in possession of the wrong social values. Trump supporters, wrote David Rothkopf, professor of international relations, former CEO of Foreign Policy magazine and a member of Bill Clinton’s administration, are people “threatened by what they don’t understand and what they don’t understand is almost everything”. They regard knowledge as “not a useful tool but a cunning barrier elites have created to keep power from the average man and woman”. Much the same has been said about Brexit supporters.Opposition to populism has too often turned into scorn for the ability of ordinary people to take important political decisions. “It is unfair to thrust on to unqualified simpletons the responsibility to take historic decisions of great complexity and sophistication,” the biologist Richard Dawkins observed. The right to vote, many insist, should be restricted to those with sufficient knowledge.“Today, we frankly recognise that democracy can be no more than aspiration,” Young wrote in his 1958 satire, “and have rule not so much by the people as by the cleverest people not an aristocracy of birth, not a plutocracy of wealth, but a true meritocracy of talent.” The trouble is, such a view is no longer seen as satire.“Class distinctions,” as Richard Hoggart, the cultural studies pioneer, once observed, “do not die they merely learn new ways of expressing themselves.” Posh like the upper classes we may no longer want to be. Contemptuous of the lower orders too many remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/211826910331408e03d5919900d862bb7cff19d9/0_212_3175_1904/master/3175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d246ed117e9a4fbc00f4a33e4c8ce431","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of fizz","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘fizz’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘fizz’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what fizz means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 January at 10am.

The new GCSE qualifications have been reformed to provide more rigorous content, so young people are taught the knowledge and skills they need for future study and employment.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said private schools were within their rights to choose the internationally recognised exams, which include coursework, and should not be blamed – but added that the system was incoherent.“This issue highlights the mess the government has made of the qualification system. It’s only a few years ago that Michael Gove was encouraging headteachers to introduce IGCSEs into their schools because it was seen as a better qualification than the GCSE,” he said.“This was followed by hasty rewriting of GCSEs, stripping coursework out of most of them, and placing huge amounts of emphasis on final examination papers. Now the government has removed most IGCSEs from school performance tables, which effectively means state school pupils can no longer take these qualifications.“Year 11 pupils typically sit more than 30 hours of examinations in the new GCSE system, and we are very concerned about the impact on their mental health and wellbeing.”Analysis by Powell’s office of GCSEs on offer at top independent schools shows that none of the highest-performing schools puts their pupils in for the full suite of the tough new GCSEs in EBacc subjects. These core areas, which the government thinks it is important for young people to study to GCSE level, include English language and literature, maths, the sciences, geography or history and a language.Pupils at £40,668-per year Eton College were only entered into IGCSEs in EBacc subjects.Pupils at schools including the £37,296-per year boarding school Sevenoaks School and £17,040-per year Abbey School in Reading were only entered for IGCSEs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06196d1c48096603ef60c2cd64fa5d942839330/0_22_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad56ca5a185f1b43355ecf6ae349ad26","title":"mark kermode best films 2018","story":"From Debra Granik’s flawless drama to Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-winning fantasy, it’s been quite a ride. See our top 10 list below• Read the Observer critics’ review of 2018 in full hereOnce again, it’s the films I couldn’t find space for in my top 10 that tell us what an exciting year it’s been. From Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread (with its brilliant Jonny Greenwood score), which opened here in February, to Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite (superb performances from Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone), which previews from Boxing Day, 2018 was full of strange wonders. Whether it was Andrew Kötting’s adventurous Lek and the Dogs, Damien Chazelle’s grief-stricken First Man, or Ol Parker’s delightfully daft Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, there were simply too many terrific titles for one list.The year got off to a flying start with the UK release of a number of awards contenders including Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (starring an Oscar-winning Frances McDormand), Darkest Hour (a wobbly film saved by Gary Oldman’s central performance as Churchill), and Guillermo del Toro’s magical fantasy The Shape of Water, which scooped four Academy Awards, including best picture.Among the challengers for the forthcoming 91st Academy Awards, A Star Is Born (released here in October) looks a popular favourite. I was impressed by leading man Bradley Cooper’s directorial feature debut, which benefited from an assured turn by Lady Gaga.Also in the running for best picture is Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, an extraordinary black-and-white drama inspired by memories of the director’s own childhood in Mexico City. The film was one of several Netflix-backed pictures (along with the likes of Paul Greengrass’s 22 July, the Coen brothers’ Ballad of Buster Scruggs and Duncan Jones’s Mute) which became part of an ongoing debate in 2018 about the merits of theatrical screenings versus television streaming.Having been ruled ineligible for competition in Cannes, Roma skipped the festival and went on to win the Golden Lion at Venice. Elsewhere at Cannes, the Palme d’Or went to Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters, which opened here in November, while Spike Lee’s attention-grabbing BlacKkKlansman took the Grand Prix. I think it’s Lee’s best work since his Oscar-nominated 1997 documentary 4 Little Girls.On the blockbuster front, Black Panther helped to change the whitewashed face of the modern superhero flick. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (who made Fruitvale Station and Creed), it was one of the best looking and most entertaining comics-based movies in years. Marvel also scored another money-spinning hit with Avengers: Infinity War – the first instalment in a two-part saga to be concluded in next year’s Avengers: Endgame.Away from the multiplexes, it was the smaller releases that made 2018 so rewarding. I particularly loved Jeune Femme, the debut feature from Léonor Serraille, which won the Caméra d’Or at Cannes in 2017 and opened here in May. Laetitia Dosch dazzles in this superbly sympathetic and spikily comedic portrait of a young woman on the verge.There were rave reviews for Sorry to Bother You, the low-budget debut feature from musician-turned-film-maker Boots Riley that became a classic Sundance assisted indie-hit this year. I also swooned over Cold War, Paweł Pawlikowski’s award-winning, black-and-white feature inspired by, and dedicated to, his parents.It has been an intriguing year for horror, with fans and critics alike fawning over Hereditary, although personally I preferred A Quiet Place, in which Emily Blunt, currently winning hearts in Mary Poppins Returns, excelled.A new incarnation of Halloween brought the longstanding fright-franchise right up to date this year, while Gaspar Noé’s Climax and Luca Guadagnino’s remake of Dario Argento’s Suspiria both explored the devilish possibilities of dance.In animation, the year’s runaway hit was Incredibles 2, which, for me, outshone the original. But my heart belongs to Nora Twomey’s The Breadwinner, a brilliant adaptation of Deborah Ellis’s much-loved YA novel, which has something of the defiant feminist spirit of the French-Iranian gem Persepolis.In documentaries, I was riveted by Three Identical Strangers and moved to tears by Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old. But my favourite film of the year was Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, a tale of a father and daughter living off-grid in the forests of the Pacific north-west, which is as understated as it is overwhelming.Debra Granik’s low-key gem is a textbook example of show-don’t-tell film-making perfect.A young girl battles the Taliban in Nora Twomey’s superb animated adaptation of Deborah Ellis’s bestseller.Viola Davis heads up an ensemble cast to die for in Steve McQueen’s ultra-stylish update of Lynda La Plante’s 80s TV thriller.Paweł Pawlikowski’s tale of star-crossed lovers falling together and apart through the iron curtain of postwar Europe.Lynne Ramsay’s psychological anti-thriller, starring Joaquin Phoenix, reconfirms her position as a unique visual poet.Daniela Vega shines in Sebastián Lelio’s deserving winner of the Oscar for foreign language film.Splash meets Creature from the Black Lagoon in Guillermo del Toro’s magical fantasy.One of the real surprise treats of the year – an invigorating and unvarnished character study from Léonor Serraille.Spike Lee’s stranger-than-fiction tale may be set in the 1970s but it felt urgently relevant and contemporary in 2018.Peter Jackson breathes new life into 100-year-old footage of the first world war with awe-inspiring results.The most misjudged comedy of the year.

On the eve of the release of her new film, in which she plays Mary Queen of Scots, she reflects on her country’s changing social landscape and her habit of playing oddballsIn a hotel room somewhere in London, Saoirse Ronan lies on a sofa, her back rigid against one of its arms, her legs straight out in front of her. She looks a bit like a doll: one that has joints at its hips, but not at its knees. “Sorry,” she says, seemingly unable to get up as I offer her my hand. “It’s these clothes! They’re not mine, and I can’t walk in them.” In an interview she gave not so long ago, Ronan insisted that away from the film sets and the red carpets, she looks a bit like a mother of one who’s “gone mad” in Anthropologie. Her mufti comprises “a lot of knit and some pink slacks that are very comfy”. Not today, though. Today, she is straight out of the last days of disco: her high-waisted, flared jeans are tighter than tight her vertiginous velvet platforms are encrusted with coloured crystals. To get from where she is to the bottles of mineral water that are arranged on a table less than half a yard away, she could really do with wheels, or some kind of winch.The RourkeWillimon version of Mary’s life begins in 1561, when the 16-year-old queen, following the death of her husband King Francis II, arrives in Scotland from France to reclaim its throne. It takes in her struggle to rule as a Catholic in a Protestant-led country her quashing of (and, later, her failure to quash) various rebellions among her noblemen and, above all, her determination that her cousin, Elizabeth I (played with aplomb and a great deal of face powder by the Australian actor Margot Robbie), name her as her heir. Much is made of her disastrous marriage to Lord Darnley, whom Willimon depicts not only as a drunk, but as the lover of his wife’s minstrel, David Rizzio – and of Mary’s tolerance of Rizzio’s sexuality (the Scottish queen is depicted as a kind of proto-feminist whose liberal instincts are almost as devoutly felt as her Catholic faith). It also includes a scene, once Mary has been forced to abdicate and has fled south to England, in which the two queens finally meet – something that never happened in real life (Mary died in 1587 without ever having met her cousin).Ronan began acting when she was eight or nine, in a medical drama on Irish television called The Clinic. She has, then, been working as an actor for two-thirds of her young life, and it would be easy to assume that this might be one reason why she seems to have such a sense of connection with Mary Stuart, whose every move was also lived in public. But she doesn’t see it this way at all.“The experiences I was having were different from most other young people of my age,” she says, “but I wasn’t in a big Disney show where I was, like, a superstar – and I wasn’t in Harry Potter, either. I wasn’t famous. I was just a kid who was in stuff, and was very lucky to be that.”Though she was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Briony Tallis in Joe Wright’s adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel Atonement, at the age of only 13, she insists that she wasn’t known at all until 2015, when she starred as Eilis Lacey in Brooklyn (another role for which she was nominated for an Oscar). “I’ll always have that mentality of ‘no one knows who I am’ – and I like that.” Until quite recently, she still worried when she wasn’t working. Would everyone forget her? “I’ve definitely felt that in the past. But then I watched an interview with Kate Bush after she went away. No one forgets about Kate Bush. She does her thing, and then she disappears. Adele does it, too, and Daniel Day-Lewis. It’s clever, I think, and healthy.”Later, as her career built, she was home tutored. “I was away so much. But once I was in my late teens, everyone else had left school, too, and I was excited for my friends to go to college and get jobs because then it would be: great, we’re all working now.” Does she still have friends from that time? “Yes, two of my oldest are still my best mates. Christopher is my dad’s best friend’s son, and Amy is my mam’s best friend’s daughter. We all grew up together. Amy is brilliant. She would see things I was in, but she has definitely fallen asleep in two of them.” She laughs. “She only really got excited when I worked with Ryan Gosling – and then she was interested, because she loves Ryan.”She can, she says, disappear quite easily out on the streets – though less so in Ireland, where she lives by the sea close to Dublin.“A lot of people know me there. It’s a small country. That’s just the way it is. But anywhere else, yes, I can be invisible – though on the tube I do get people looking hard at their mobile phones, and really they’re surreptitiously taking a picture of me. You’re staring at them, and you’re thinking: I can see you. But some people think you only exist on the telly that you’re not a real person, and so it doesn’t matter. I would never do that myself – it would feel like you’re stealing from someone.”She’s not on social media any more, and she doesn’t read reviews.“I don’t expose myself to them. There will be something that sticks in my head, because it’s not a natural, normal thing for people you don’t know personally to write about you” – I nod my head, perhaps because our own encounter seems so bizarre, the two of us closeted in this wireless and slightly sterile hotel room, like a pair of lovers (except that right outside the door are three minders, each of them furiously tapping at their mobile phones) – and she says, almost apologetically: “Well, it can be lovely having a chat. But reviews, they’re not written for me.”This brings her to Christine McPherson, the teenager she played in Greta Gerwig’s 2017 film Lady Bird, for which she won a Golden Globe and was again nominated for an Oscar. “I was so knackered when I was doing it,” she says (she came to it straight from starring on Broadway in The Crucible). “My skin was in shit. But when you’re tired, something else comes out in you. You’re defensive and lethargic, and everything bubbles up to the surface. It freaked me out a bit, but my mam said: ‘She’s 17 and she hates everyone except her friends, and she’s a bit narky. It’s perfect.’”She’s now shooting another film with Gerwig: Little Women, in which she plays Jo. Is it any different working with a woman director? She gives me a very direct look. “Honestly? No. I just want them to be happy. They’re leading the way. It’s their vision. With any director, it feels like a pupil-teacher relationship, or a parent-child one.”She’s weary of being asked about #MeToo. She has always felt safe in her world she’s never had any trouble. She’s more interested in something I bring up: the recent comments of the Danish director, Susanne Bier, about how looks are the last taboo in Hollywood (Bier has spoken of her struggle to persuade studios to let her cast actors who do not conform to their idealised image of beauty). Ronan believes Bier is absolutely right – though this state of affairs obviously affects women far more than men.Television, she thinks, is far more advanced on this score than film. “I was watching Roseanne recently and there’s a scene with Laurie and the rest, and they’re drinking and chatting and they’re all normal-looking. What I loved, as someone who isn’t Marilyn Monroe, was to see Lena Dunham in Girls. That meant so much. What we found with Lady Bird is that, while it’s a brilliant film and everyone is so great in it, in the end the reason why it could have an effect on the industry is because it made money.”Does she feel under pressure about her own looks? “I really don’t. I suppose I was playing girls from an early age that had nothing pretty about them – they were weird or they were tomboys – and in order to do a good job I just had to go: well, fuck how I look. I never got cast for my looks anyway.”We talk for a while about how Ireland has changed (“Oh, yes!” she all but shouts when I bring it up). Before the referendum that led to the repeal of the ban on abortion, Ronan appeared in a video supporting the reproductive rights campaign. Did she think twice about speaking out? Not exactly. But these things are complicated.“When I was younger, and there were petitions to repeal the eighth, I remember thinking that even though it was the right thing, maybe I shouldn’t say anything. This was the way it had always been – and that’s being honest about it. But then you get older, and you come into your own womanhood and you realise how complicated and amazing being a woman is, and how protective you feel of your own body. The idea that anyone could have a say over that is bizarre. I’ve had friends who had to go through it – travel to Liverpool for an abortion, spend thousands of euros, put yourself in the Holiday Inn…”The new Ireland thrills her. “To know it was seen as this backward place, when it never felt like that to us. It was so disappointing. But now we match up internationally to how we see ourselves, and that feels amazing.She grins. “Is there any Irish in you?” she asks, our minds seemingly turning at precisely the same moment to Brexit. I shake my head, sadly. “Ah, don’t worry,” she says. “I’ll get you a passport.” She sounds so very sincere that when her hands go to the waistband of her jeans, still cutting her in two, I half expect her to pull one miraculously from her pocket.Mary Queen of Scots is in cinemas from 18 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89972d464dfcdcd9e1772051167c0578d1f0a2f1/0_1676_4897_2937/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e42db304860c95240fb65d106636e3fe","title":"nigel slater pineapple and clementine recipes","story":"Bright and fruity treats to brighten the darkest daysI’m not entirely sure why I bought a pineapple. I only know that I did and what is more, I do each and every Christmas. Pineapple is far from my favourite fruit. Too sweet, too much trouble to peel and slice. It can dominate in a fruit salad and I have yet to find a cheese for which it does any favours, which is why this year’s specimen has ended up in a cake with walnuts, cardamom and capped with icing.I have much fondness for the pineapple upside-down cake of my youth with its lurid glacé cherries. Believe me when I say it was as exciting as cake got in 1960s Wolverhampton. But it was one of the first cakes I ever baked and we always remember those early successes. The pineapple in today’s cake was a subtle addition, diced small and enriched with ground walnuts from the distinctly depleted fruit bowl. I put passionfruit in the icing, bought for a pavlova (never made) and one of the few fruits whose acidity will stand up to a pineapple.There are a couple of pomegranates remaining whose garnet seeds will end up in a tabbouleh, but the real treasure is a wooden casket of clementines. Their juice and zest are the distilled essence of the season, but that doesn’t quite explain why I bought so many. They stayed for a while in a brass bowl on the hall table, as jolly as a bag of baubles, but they are showing their age. I shall not waste them. They will dazzle again in a New Year water ice, their slightly thin juice fleshed out with a splash of scarlet bitters. A little cheer for the slow days following the feast.A mercifully un-sweet, nutty cake, kept exceptionally moist by the inclusion of fresh pineapple. It would be good for dessert, served with ice cream. Vanilla for preference. The cake will keep in perfect condition for several days, wrapped in foil.For the cake:eggs 4caster sugar 125gwalnut halves 120ggreen cardamom pods 10self-raising flour 100gpineapple 250g ground almonds 65gfresh white breadcrumbs 60gFor the icing:icing sugar 120gclementines 3clementine or orange juice about 1½ tbspwalnut halves a handfuldried rose petals 1 tbspYou will need a loaf tin measuring approx. 20 x 9cm across the base and 7-8cm highSet the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Line the cake tin with baking parchment.Separate the eggs. Put the yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer, add the sugar and whisk until thick and pale. Chop the walnuts. They should be neither be finely chopped or as fine as commercially ground almonds but somewhere in between, rather like fine gravel, so that texture of the finished cake will be chewy.Crack open the cardamom pods, extract the small black seeds then grind to a fine powder and stir into the flour. Finely dice the pineapple. Beat the egg whites until almost stiff. Mix together the walnuts, ground almonds, breadcrumbs and flour. Using a large spoon, fold a third of the dry ingredients into the egg yolk and sugar mixture together with a third of the beaten egg whites, then continue with the rest of the mixture. Lastly fold in the diced pineapple.Transfer the batter to the lined tin – it will come almost to the top – and bake for 60-65 minutes or until a metal skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out without any raw cake mixture on it. If it browns too quickly cover loosely with a piece of foil. Remove the cake from the oven and set aside, letting it rest in its tin, for 30 minutes before lifting out by its paper and transferring to a cooling rack.Sieve the icing sugar into a small mixing bowl. Finely grate the zest from the clementines and add to the sugar then stir in the juice, a very little at a time, until you have a pourable icing that will coat the cake and run slowly the sides.Spoon the icing over the surface of the completely cooled cake, letting it trickle down the sides. Roughly chop the walnuts and scatter over the icing with the dried rose petals.The colour of a winter sunset, this deeply refreshing ice will use up a whole pile of clementines and even make a hole in that bottle of Campari. I have also made this with grenadine, and although slightly sweeter, it was good, too. This is not an ice to scoop but rather to fork the surface into coarse crystals, as you might a granita.Finely grate the zest from 6 clementines into a large measuring jug. Halve all of the clementines and the lemon, and squeeze into the jug. You will probably end up with about 750ml of mixed juice.Put the sugar into a saucepan with the water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and pour the clementine juice into the pan. Halve the passion fruits, then scrape their seeds and juice into a small sieve or tea strainer balanced over the clementine juice. Using a teaspoon, scrape the seeds against the sides of the sieve until all the juice has been extracted from the pulp and seeds.Pour the Campari into the juice, tasting as you go transfer to a freezer box, seal with a clip-on lid and freeze till solid.To serve, run the tines of a fork across the surface, ploughing up the ice crystals.

One flash of quality was all it took to claim the spoils across south London and open up a five point gap from fifth place. Crystal Palace failed to muster a single shot on target all afternoon. They never discovered whether the visitors were fragile or not.This had been desperately humdrum until N’Golo Kanté, his head coach’s half-time instructions presumably still ringing in his ears, injected some impetus early in the second half. Chelsea had been probing, David Luiz sizing up his options in possession inside Palace’s half, when the France midfielder took it upon himself to dart behind and away from Cheikh Kouyaté and between Patrick van Aanholt and Mamadou Sakho to the edge of the six-yard box. David Luiz’s lofted pass was perfectly weighted, with Kanté collecting neatly on his chest and steering his close-range finish in beyond Vicente Guaita’s outstretched left hand.It was a fine goal utterly out of character with everything mustered up to then, and plenty thereafter. Palace had been stubborn, organised but distinctly unambitious and toothless going forward. Chelsea’s tempo had been slack, lacking invention and incision when confronted by a five-man midfield barrier, until they roused themselves towards the end of a dreary opening period to strike the woodwork twice. Even then, the hosts would have had cause for complaint had either effort actually secured the lead.Eden Hazard, scuttling into a rare pocket of space, had clipped his own heel 11 minutes from the break before tumbling, with Craig Pawson awarding a generous free-kick. Willian struck that on to the outside of the post as Guaita ed, with the referee compounding his earlier error by spying a non-existent touch from the goalkeeper. Willian would test the Spaniard again from distance at that set-piece, forcing a second corner from which Ross Barkley, having shoved James McArthur away, acrobatically flicked a shot on to the same upright with his back to goal.The flurry of chances had hinted at promise but would not have satisfied Sarri, fidgeting in frustration in his technical area, even if the lead secured early after the break duly lifted the Italian’s mood. Chelsea felt in complete control against a side who cannot secure forward reinforcements – with Dominic Solanke, on loan from Liverpool, likely to be the first – soon enough.Palace would eventually introduce Connor Wickham to provide more punch but, other than the substitute planting a half-volley over the bar, a team who had plundered three goals at Manchester City just before Christmas rarely boasted a threat. Their calendar year has fizzled out, and they cannot consider themselves clear yet of trouble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdacd94e7ef5bdc32619c68707a7b1fe6338a161/0_103_2748_1649/master/2748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25969fe6835efbe272e671091266b48","title":"how leeds fell in love with marcelo bielsa","story":"The genius they call El Loco has steered his team to the top of the Championship, and breathed new confidence into the cityWe are fast approaching the 60th anniversary of the publication of Billy Liar. Or, as some of us like to call it, the Book of Leeds. In Keith Waterhouse’s classic novel, the underachieving anti-hero fantasises about living the dream but ends up sabotaging his own chance of happiness, abandoning Liz, his girlfriend, played by Julie Christie in the film.We are also fast approaching the centenary of Leeds United. For most of its 100 years, the club – like the city – has been a byword for underachievement. Indeed, ever since their overspending chairman Peter Ridsdale triggered an infamous meltdown in 2004, “doing a Leeds” has become synonymous with living the nightmare.There was the great Don Revie team of the 1970s, and Howard Wilkinson’s side won the title in 1992. But for the last 26 years, apart from promotion from the third tier, the Whites have languished in the wilderness.Billy Liar, Waterhouse revealed, was his Leeds novel. In 1959 he wrote: “The city was stirring out of its pre-war, post-Edwardian sleep. There was a civic restlessness about, a growing clamour for clearing away the old.” In the following six decades there have been several failed attempts at reinvention. But now a messiah has finally arrived to give us self-belief. To convince us that, unlike Billy, we can catch the train to the promised land and marry Ms Christie.Most people mistakenly assume David Peace’s The Damned Utd is the Book of Leeds. This is a great novel, but its thesis – that Revie’s “brutes” reflected a flaw within the psyche of the city – is itself flawed. As the messiah, also known as Marcelo Bielsa, is currently demonstrating.Since being relegated from the Premier League 14 years ago, the club has lurched from financial disaster to despair, tumbling down the isions, going into administration and selling their best young players. At the same time the city, trying to rebrand itself as the “Barcelona of the north”, has seen its own fantasies – the “northern powerhouse”, HS2, the European city of culture – crumble into dust.Appointed only seven months ago by chairman Andrea Radrizzani, Bielsa has changed everything. He has transformed Leeds from a laughing stock into Championship leaders, despite Saturday’s home defeat. He has moulded the team in his image. He has turned our world upside down. All while sitting emotionless on an upturned blue bucket.Under the cerebral 63-year-old’s guidance, Leeds are playing a brand of exhilarating football admired by Pep Guardiola, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane. All three have been mentored by Bielsa. To Guardiola, who once flew to Buenos Aires and drove 185 miles to talk to his guru, he is “the best coach in the world”. Pochettino, who was signed by Bielsa as a teenager in Argentina, revealed that the then-Newell’s Old Boys coach visited his home to inspect his legs as he slept. This last story is one of many confirming the myth of El Loco, the crazy one. On arrival at Elland Road, he immediately ordered his stars to collect litter from the pitches. Players are weighed every morning and regularly put in 12-hour shifts. They are sometimes prevented from returning home at night. He has installed a bed at the training ground and often sleeps over at Thorp Arch.At Athletic Bilbao, he once visited a convent and asked nuns to pray for his team. He has banned his own assistants from games because they underperformed in training. Asked if Bielsa really is as mad as people say, an Athletic striker replied: “No. He’s madder.”As Leeds fans are discovering, there is method in his madness. He watches the games on a bucket because the Elland Road dugout is below pitch level and it gives him a better vantage point. It might be eccentric but they love their quirky messiah. They pore over his press conference utterances like undergraduates deconstructing a revered professor’s lectures. They particularly enjoyed his response to Norwich City painting the away dressing room deep pink in order to lower testosterone levels he spent ten minutes ruminating on the nature of desire.They love him for being a workaholic, obsessed with fitness. They love his revolutionary training methods, his humility on and off the pitch, his insistence that the length of the grass is perfect. They love Bielsa ball, where the players aggressively win the ball back, give their opponents no time to breathe and keep possession for long periods. They make videos of songs about blue buckets. They sing his name to the tune of the White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army and, most recently, a group of supporters released Bielsa’s Rhapsody, a magnificent adaptation of the Queen ditty.So we love him for making us a community again. In his unflashy way he has played a huge part in the revival of a great city. Indeed he has been a breath of fresh air for football as a whole. In an ever-swelling economy – mind-blowing TV contracts, rocketing ticket prices, disconnection with traditional communities – he has helped to restore the soul of the Beautiful Game.In 2019 an underachieving club, and city, will hopefully be finally delivered from the wilderness. Leeds United will return to the promised land and be an antidote to the vanity, selfishness and greed of the money-obsessed Premier League.Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Quite clearly, it is the former. The Bucket Man cometh. In Bielsa we trust.Anthony Clavane is a sports writer, and author of Promised Land and A Yorkshire Tragedy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5e2d75af37428c4d86437936dcf4d789491ff7a/0_176_1651_990/master/1651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94a39596135c319594112b3dc7d7b7d4","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp arsenal manchester city","story":"There was a moment just before half-time on Saturday, with Liverpool 3-1 up, when Jürgen Klopp strode to the edge of the technical area, eyes flashing behind his glasses, finger jabbing, fury written across his face. Sadio Mané had given the ball away cheaply and had failed to track back and Arsenal had briefly threatened. A couple of minutes later, Mohamed Salah was bundled over by Sokratis Papastathopoulos, converting the resultant penalty and Liverpool were 4-1 up. It was one of those days: however sloppy Liverpool were at times, Arsenal were much, much worse.In the other technical area, a grimacing Unai Emery looked even more like Alan Partridge than ever, as though trying to give a speech to the sales conference of a firm specialising in coal-effect fires after piercing his foot on a spike. By midway through the first half, he had given up his guiding role on the touchline to sit on the bench: there is, in the end, only so much you can do with those players. The impact Emery has made at Arsenal, the change in style and focus, has been remarkable but sometimes the scorpion is going to sting the frog, however self-defeating it may be, because that is what a scorpion does.Last season, Arsenal were rabbits-in-the-headlights dreadful in losing 4-0 at Anfield. Saturday was nowhere near as bad. There was at least some fight, some resistance, a plan revolving around a tactical switch to 4-2-3-1 and an attempt to get in behind the Liverpool full-backs, who seem to be becoming more adventurous by the week.And briefly, it worked, until the defensive inadequacy took over: a lack of decisiveness leading to a series of unfortunate ricochets a pair of challenges, that were somehow both intemperate and ineffectual, that Roberto Firmino tiptoed between a lack of alertness after a corner had been half-cleared, first as Andy Robertson returned the ball towards Salah and then as he played it across goal two penalties needlessly and clumsily conceded.The image of Lucas Torreira sprawled on his face, desperately swimming across the turf, still believing he might somehow be able to effect a block as Firmino lined up his finish for the second, summed it up. It had been Torreira, given an awful pass in an awful situation, who had lost possession to initiate the attack, but he was still straining everything to get back, let down by two central defenders whose idea of stopping a rampaging forward was to wag a meek foot in his general direction. Injuries robbed Emery of Héctor Bellerín, Rob Holding and Nacho Monreal and meant Laurent Koscielny started on the bench, but a new central defence must be a priority whenever next there is money to spend.And what of Liverpool, extending their lead at the top of the table? There was talk of a statement win, which is true but only if the statement is: “Arsenal are prone to bouts of debilitating self-destructiveness”. Few teams who win 5-1 can ever be said to have played badly but how good, really, were they? They were too quick and too aggressive for Arsenal, they ripped through them again and again, but this was at times a strangely ragged performance.There are numerous factors to be taken into account but as a rough contrast, Manchester City have lost the ball once every 28.1 passes over the course of the season .Liverpool have not been as gung-ho this campaign. Their average is 24.4 passes per loss of possession. But against Arsenal, at least early on, was a reversion to the old Liverpool. Perhaps that was part of a conscious ploy. Perhaps Klopp realised this Arsenal can be intimated and so set his full-backs to storm forward, encouraging a ferocious press. Control can at times consist of letting slip the leash.But Pep Guardiola, you suspect, would not have been awed. No manager has a better record against Guardiola than Klopp, proof his cohorts of chaos can unsettle Guardiola’s order and organisation, but what has made Liverpool particularly impressive this season has been the step back into a more controlled style, as evidenced by the remarkable defensive record of eight goals conceded in 20 league games.Impressive as the scoreline appears, impressive as Liverpool’s character was in hitting back from conceding an early goal, there was a raggedness to the performance against Arsenal and that perhaps, represents an opportunity for City on Thursday. Then again, when the forward line are playing with such abandon and wreaking such havoc, maybe it makes no sense for Klopp to try to get them back in harness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07b58b459f3721f97237e0063fa8e5698890ad84/40_315_3650_2190/master/3650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f469279d87539b079c5f65e4937aeae5","title":"manchester uniteds old rites of passage built some characters but broke others","story":"The stories Gary Neville and Robbie Savage tell of 1990s initiations can be seen as lads being lads but it is time the club admitted that in some case the culture damaged livesAs Gary Neville will be able to testify, making love to Clayton Blackmore in front of the entire Manchester United first team was not the most pleasurable experience of his years as an up-and-coming player in the club’s apprentice ranks.Not the real Clayton Blackmore, obviously. But the players who set up the game called “Shag Sunbed” – maybe you remember Blackmore’s all-year tan – did their best to make it authentic, sticking a life-size picture of him on the treatment table, slipping on some Barry White and then watching as Neville, or whoever else had been called out, had to dance round the table, seduce his man and, in front of everybody, simulate sex, sound effects and all. “I can’t tell you how excruciating that is for a 16-year-old in front of an audience of his heroes like Mark Hughes and Bryan Robson,” Neville writes in his autobiography.In football, they know this as the culture of the initiation ceremony. Or hazing, as they know it in the United States. Except it was not a one-off event, as part of a getting‑to‑know‑you process, but more a standard part of life at Old Trafford. And, however degrading it might have been, it was often better to do what was required than risk one of the forfeits put together by the older apprentices or first-year pros.One was known as “The Lap”, where the boy would be put on a treatment bed, looking through the hole, while the players lined up to kick a ball at his face. Sometimes it would be a flurry of punches to deliver a dead arm, or whacking someone over the head with a ball wrapped in a towel, a practice known as “The Bong”. One apprentice was dressed up in several layers of tracksuits and barricaded into the sauna. Others were bundled into an industrial tumble drier and sent for a spin. There is even the story of one boy, the smallest in his year group, being tied up, gagged and put in a kitbag to be taken to Old Trafford on the bus.Banter, bullying, laddishness – whatever you want to call it, it is easy to understand why even strong characters such as Neville and Paul Scholes, let alone the ones who might not have been so mentally tough, are on record saying they hated some of the stuff that went on and sometimes dreaded entering the dressing room.All good fun? Character building? Many people, inside and outside the game, will see it that way, yes, and there is no doubt a lot of the relevant players tend to share these experiences with a certain amount of laughter, too. The stories have become part of the United legend, widely regarded as an essential part of the toughening-up process for every young player who made the grade. Footballers being footballers, lads being lads. “Generations of footballers must have gone through the same thing,” Robbie Savage, another United graduate who was put through it, writes in his autobiography, “and it didn’t do anyone any harm.”Except that is not necessarily true. In the last few days I have been made aware of one former player, now in his 40s, who found it such an ordeal he says he is still haunted by it today, likening it to post-traumatic stress disorder. Another has been left with anxiety, depression, a loss of confidence and other psychological scars from what were supposed to be the most exciting years of his life. The father of one player, the Observer has learned, is exploring the possibility of setting up some kind of supportaction group for anybody else who was affected. Early days, but the idea is taking shape – and not just for ex-United boys when, plainly, this kind of activity was commonplace at other clubs, too.To be clear, it is not compensation that is sought – nor even an apology (as welcome as one would be), more an acknowledgement that, yes, it should not have been that way, that things went too far and an acceptance, all these years on, that the environment that brought through so many great footballers had punishing consequences for others.Whether that will ever be forthcoming from Old Trafford, however, I am not entirely sure. Earlier this year, the club’s solicitor, Patrick Stewart, wrote to one parent telling him there had been a number of “reviews” over the previous decade. Nothing had been found to support the parent’s allegations, Stewart wrote in the bluntest terms, adding that there was no point going over it again unless new evidence had come to light.When I asked United if they would accept there had been a culture of hazing – a practice made illegal in some parts of the United States – the club did not commit either way, responding with a statement emphasising the importance they placed on the wellbeing of young players. “While it is difficult to establish the existence or extent of these practices in past eras, the club takes these matters seriously,” it read.But is it really that difficult? Are United aware, presumably, about the considerable number of former players – David Beckham, Keith Gillespie, Ryan Giggs and more than there is space here to list – who have talked openly about what used to go on and, in some cases, devoted thousands of words to it in their autobiographies?If it was so difficult to establish the truth, could the club invite Nicky Butt to recall his experiences from those years (he is, after all, their academy coach)? Or, failing that, watch The Class of ’92, the documentary film in which the stars of that generation talk about it extensively? Can United not locate any of the other players who are not household names but have spoken publicly about their own experiences? Because it really should not be difficult whatsoever.In which case, the players who came up with these stunts achieved something very rare indeed, bearing in mind Ferguson’s well-established reputation for supposedly knowing everything that went on at the club. Nobody knew anything, according to United, until a parent complained at the time. But it is a pity that Gill did not specify who he meant by “relevant staff” when, rather awkwardly, Neville’s book claims that certain coaches seemed happy to look the other way.Everything got out of hand, he adds, when another player got so annoyed by all the punishment whacks he started swinging back. “Kiddo got wind of it and summoned all the second-years together.” Kiddo, of course, being Brian Kidd, the youth-team coach and, later, Ferguson’s assistant.The bottom line here is that, whether the staff remember it or not, there is so much evidence pointing in the same direction it is a shame United appear unwilling to accept it as fact. Savage, for instance, remembers some of his teammates being so petrified about what might happen once they returned to the dressing room they could barely concentrate on training.Yet he also makes the point in his autobiography that, to him, it was not unduly sinister, or out of order, just all part of the challenge of becoming a professional footballer – you got your head down, worked hard and got on with it. Some got through it, some didn’t, and some turned out to be among the finest players the country has ever produced. The lucky ones are convinced it helped the bonding process and, to go back to the earlier point, it would be wrong to think this is just a United thing – or that it is only football where the humour is this brutal and unforgiving.They even made a storyline out of it on The Inbetweeners once, with three of the main characters going further than could ever be appropriate to ingratiate themselves with some students at Warwick University – Neil downing a cocktail of orangeade mixed with fag butts, Jay punching himself in the face and Will eating a bonsai tree.Except it is not so funny, back in the real world, when you hear the story of a player at one club who was left with a stutter because of the “blacking” he endured during the 1980s – involving the pinning down of young apprentices while their testicles were daubed with black boot polish. Or what was meant by “The Teapot”, when the victim would be turned over and a hot receptacle placed against his buttocks.At United, one of the stunts organised by the first- and second‑year pros in the club’s digs was to gather together the younger boys, put on a pornographic video and the first player to get aroused would have to endure the forfeit, usually a barrage of punches. It was a tough school and if United really wanted to find out exactly what had gone on it should not be difficult. Just ask the relevant players, read the books, watch the film. But that, perhaps, is the relevant question here: do they really want to know?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4384f6d9ba05233add1cd99150f908b382b6877e/39_133_2261_1356/master/2261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40fdea98ff36ba4e414bb048f57be935","title":"crystal palace v chelsea premier league live","story":"N’Golo Kante’s goal helped Chelsea tighten their grip on fourth place and kept Crystal Palace too close to the bottom three for comfortI’ll leave you with Dominic Fifield’s match report from Selhurst Park.

Was that the game’s turning point? I think there was some contact but it looked faint and a bit of a six-of-one situation.Well. For half an hour this looked as simple an afternoon as City will have. But Saints roared back, equalised and looked the likelier – before that sickening, and deeply unfortunate, double blow right at the end of the half.That’s why they’re champions. Zinchenko crosses from fairly deep and Aguero, finding space between two static centre-halves, heads downwards and in from six yards. McCarthy gets a hand to it but in it goes ... and this game has suddenly swung far away from Saints.45+2 min: “2-1 to the referee” sing the home fans, but I’m not so sure about that. But City, with their first moment of genuine threat for ages, have doused the hosts’ fire at the perfect time for them – and possibly found a way out of what seemed to be some serious trouble.Oh, what a blow for Saints. That’s come right out of nothing. Sterling receives the ball in a nice position on the left of the box, pulls it across and sees it ping off Ward-Prowse past a startled McCarthy and in. City are ahead again!43 min: Saints are now harrying City like tigers, forcing errors and hurried clearances. It’s what brought the goal and it’s the style Hasenhuttl swears by. It just took them half an hour to do it! They scream for a penalty as Ward-Prowese chests the ball down in the box and goes over under Zinchenko’s challenge, but I think it would have been softy.42 min: City, at last, get back on the ball again and Aguero snatches a glimmer of a chance wide after decent work from Bernardo Silva on the left.39 min: How this has turned. Saints come again and earn another corner. This game is alive now. It’s defended well enough but how things pan out now will be fascinating. City have not been in the game in the past 12 or 13 minutes.And that good spell brings devastating results! City build from the back again and everything seems OK. But Zinchenko, 40 yards from his own goal, doesn’t realise Hojbjerg is around to pick his pocket and is swiftly mugged. The midfielder surges forward, with City on the turn now, and brings the ball into box – lashing the ball fiercely into the roof of the net above a startled Ederson!36 min: For all City’s control has been near-total, Saints could easily have scored twice here. They’ll take some encouragement from the last five or six minutes, definitely, although their flow is interrupted by some treatment to Bernardo Silva – who seems to have sustained a cut of some kind but is back on now. Burnley lead West Ham 2-0, in the meantime.33 min: This is Saints’ best spell, which isn’t really saying a lot admittedly, and Aguero – of all people, etc etc – is back to stop Hojbjerg letting fly inside the box. He’s then booked for felling Targett out on the left. Ward-Prowse delivers well and the home side earn their first corner. From which Ederson saves brilliantly! Ward-Prowse’s inswinger is flicked on at the near post by Austin, who appears to have found the far corner but is thwarted by a big hand by the keeper!29 min: Saints do whip a couple of balls into the City box now, though. They’re defended comfortably enough but that’s something. It all goes wrong when Elyounoussi knocks the ball out of play from a well-placed throw-in, to more groans. City’s only problems are coming from their own dalliances at the back and Ederson has to get himself out of danger a mere yard from the goal line with another smart piece of footwork.27 min: Sterling, found by a silky Zinchenko pass, cuts inside but tries to do too much and two Saints defenders crowd him out in a slightly ungainly scissor-type format. There is absolutely nothing for the home fans to shout about currently.25 min: What will annoy Hasenhuttl is that, quite apart from their obvious technical and footballing superiority, City are winning all the 5050s and plenty of less favourable challenges too. They nearly score a second now, a brilliant one-touch move ending with McCarthy spreading himself to block from Aguero from six yards. He’s saved his side twice now and City could be out of sight here.23 min: And another corner for City, who are so dominant it’s untrue. It goes short this time and is again eventually cleared, but Saints just can’t get on the ball here and City begin to build again.21 min: City’s second corner of the game is swung in by Mahrez, whose delivery is good but met by a Saints head. Back come the visitors, though, retaining possession and then almost carving out another opening as Danilo surges forward before finding Aguero, who is tackled at the last.19 min: Stephens almost gifts City another chance with a sloppy pass. City just aren’t letting Saints build from the back, but the home side really might do better if they woke up a tad and improved their decision making. Moments later City almost score one of the goals of the season, a piece of defensive brinkmanship from Ederson, Kompany and Fernandinho in their own box ending with an intricate escape from danger and a 50-yard run and curler inches wide from Mahrez.17 min: Southampton really can’t get out, although their supporters can enjoy themselves for a moment when Sterling lets a simple Zinchenko pass trickle out of play. Burnley are ahead against West Ham, to compound their early difficulties.15 min: Groans from the home fans as Ward-Prowse receives possession in the City half but is forced backwards. That Austin chance was a good one but it came from their only moment inside opposition territory so far.13 min: This has “long afternoon” writ large upon it for Southampton at the moment.Saints are made to pay. Bernardo Silva is played in down the right by Mahrez and there’s tonnes of space. He lays back with the outside of the foot to David Silva, again eight yards out, and this time he makes no mistake. The finish is emphatic and the goal had, perhaps, been coming despite that Austin blooper.9 min: Oh, Austin has a golden chance! Elyounoussi’s diagonal ball catches City’s defence napping and the striker doesn’t seem to quite believe how much time he has. Ederson is coming out quickly but if he sorts his feet out he could slot it past him into the vacant goal – but messes his touch up and the relieved keeper gathers.5 min: It could – should? – be 1-0 to City. Stephens tries to shepherd the ball away from Sterling near the left byline but makes a total mess of it and now there’s trouble. Sterling turns inside and finds David Silva, who is only eight yards out. He takes a touch and goes for goal – you can hear the away fans cheering but in fact McCarthy makes a quite excellent one-handed save and Saints, who aren’t helping themselves at this stage, survive!3 min: City seem to fancy this, Aguero and Silva combining smartly to send Sterling away but finding the move thwarted by a correctly-raised flag.2 min: City show first, Mahrez trying to make for the byline but finding Targett in his way. A corner results, but David Silva’s delivery is flicked away by a defender.If you are watching in your mind’s eye, they kick from left to right.Anyway – the teams are out at St Mary’s. We’re close!Is that so? Their front three, yes. But players such as Henderson, Keita and Gomez have missed a fair bit of football haven’t they?Ok, ok. But did they play awful football? I thought they tried to do the right things but just weren’t good enough in either box. The change had to be made but they weren’t *dour* were they?Saints, by the way, field an 18-year-old at right-back. Kayne Ramsay makes his league debut and what an occasion this is for him!That’s that then.Chelsea have won at Palace – Kante scoring the clincher. They stay fourth, ahead of Arsenal by five points.A good Saints stat. They’ll be looking to harry City intensively, I fancy.City fans, do you think the wheels have come off? Or is this just the sort of blip that should normally happen to everyone, accentuated by the fact Liverpool have come to look so imperious? The tempo on and off the ball is just that little bit down, isn’t it – is Guardiola’s style that difficult to maintain over a period of years? I don’t know, but I’d like to hear if you do.As I write, Crystal Palace are hosting Chelsea. They’re doing so fairly graciously at the moment, as they’re a goal down. Can’t they play Man City every week? Jacob Steinberg has the MBM:Kompany, David Silva and Fernandinho are back for City, who miss Kevin De Bruyne – perhaps crucially, who knows? – and Ilkay Gundogan.What have we here? Manchester City *scrambling* to stay in the title race? Not quite – but almost, sort of. They are 10 points behind Liverpool, a tally that hardly seems believable, and really need to buck up pronto if Jurgen Klopp’s men aren’t going to to disappear over the horizon in the manner they did last season. If that sounds a touch alarmist, consider that City host Liverpool on Thursday – if they don’t get something today then it’s arguable the entire season hinges on that. Which it might anyway.Glad we’ve cleared all that up. Basically it all means we’re in for a fascinating and possibly very critical 90 minutes in the season. It’s hard to know what to expect from Southampton, who – *controversial opinion alert* – weren’t terrible under Mark Hughes but had found a bit of extra bite under Ralph Hasenhuttl until their defeat to West Ham. In truth we won’t really know what the Saints are until next season. Hasenhuttl has fairly complex ideas of pressing and work without the ball, in particular, and you’d imagine he will instil those in fairly lite form until they are over the safety line. But this certainly seems a slippery one for Guardiola and company against an unpredictable side that will be up for it – and probably not a fixture they wanted at this stage.Perhaps they should watch the video of this fixture in March, where Gabriel Jesus struck at the death to ease them over the 100-point barrier. Times have changed, although not drastically just yet. Everyone loses a couple – in a healthy competition, anyway. But City have broken the mould of everything we expect in the Premier League over the past 15 months they either have to get their mojo back pronto, or find another way to get back on track.It should be fascinating.

His hit one-man show, ’75, comes to London in January. VT2019 could be the year Apple cements its reputation as the “new Microsoft” – a company with a massive valuation that has ceased to innovate. Iterations of the iPhone still account for the majority of its revenue, and with an entry point device costing £749, it feels increasingly like a company aimed at wealthy baby boomers. Throwing $100bn at next year’s revamp of Apple TV doesn’t feel like a new paradigm.Moreover, despite some recent deals with Amazon to get its services on Alexa devices, Apple has fallen behind and priced itself out of the burgeoning market for connected gadgets and digital assistants. Google Home or Alexa-based devices are increasingly embedded in homes (and cars) and often don’t play well with iPhones.Whether you are wired in to Apple, Google or Alexa has become like choosing a football team – you can only support one and it’s impossible to swap.Meanwhile, Facebook will be hoping its declining popularity in Europe doesn’t turn into a stampede if the EU’s investigations about data sharing result in enormous fines, the advertising it is introducing to WhatsApp in 2019 doesn’t prompt users to join other messaging services, and the cloning of Instagram’s Stories format by Facebook and YouTube doesn’t ert revenue and readers to other platforms.Well worth a read will be The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight For A Human Future At The New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor.

IT The football year will pivot around the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France over the summer, with the USA favourites to retain their title, and England, Germany and France among the pack on their heels. Around the same time, an as-yet-undecided host will stage the Africa Cup of Nations. And, in Portugal, England’s men will hope to win the inaugural Uefa Nations League, a triumph that could yet signify the end of 50-odd years of hurt, depending on the current tournament exchange rate for agonising nostalgia.The year in cricket will be dominated by the 50-over World Cup in England, followed almost directly by the Ashes, an epic-scale domestic double-bill that offers the summer game a chance to either dig its talons back into the national consciousness or confirm its own shift to the pay-TV periphery.Then there’s the Rugby Union World Cup, a gruelling 42-day jamboree that kicks off in Japan at the start of September. New Zealand will be favourites because, well, they’re New Zealand. But Ireland and England will also fancy their chances.Elsewhere, boxing will try to cash in on the sudden wealth of star power in the heavyweight ision.

BR1 January 2019 will – so the government says – be the last New Year’s Day that the United Kingdom spends as a member of the European Union. Both Theresa May and the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insist we must honour the result of the 2016 referendum and end our membership on 29 March. That is in just under 13 weeks’ time.But whatever they say, the only thing that really is certain in British politics is that nothing is certain at all. Few new years have approached with so much up in the air. Much will be determined by what happens on Brexit – yet no one can be at all sure how Brexit will turn out.Will it go ahead as planned, be delayed, or stopped in its tracks? With parliament deadlocked and a no-deal outcome looming into view, there is increasing talk of pushing back the date, or holding another referendum to break the impasse. The other possibility is another general election.May clung on as prime minister before Christmas despite more than a third of Tory backbenchers in her deeply ided party saying they have no confidence in her. But, if she fails to get her own Brexit deal through parliament in January and if any of the three scenarios outlined above happen, it is hard to imagine how she could survive.Labour, too, is ided on Brexit. For the first time since becoming leader in 2015, Corbyn is coming under fire within his party for refusing to oppose Britain leaving the EU and throw his weight behind a new public vote.The centre ground, meanwhile, is wide open. Increasingly there is talk of discontented Labour and Tory MPs, perhaps backed by Liberal Democrats, forming a new centrist party from the political rubble left by Brexit.One to watch: Amber Rudd. She is now back in the cabinet as work and pensions secretary. Although she is a strong Remainer, few are better placed to succeed Theresa May if she does not survive 2019 as prime minister. THThe new year gets off to an ominous start with the inauguration on Tuesday of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to accelerate mining and agribusiness exploitation of the Amazon, the world’s biggest rainforest. Scientific attention may also be focused on the Arctic, where meteorologists will be watching to see if last winter’s high temperatures were a one-off or a disturbing new trend caused by a weakened polar vortex.If weather forecasters are correct, 2019 could also be another El Niño year, which means many parts of the world could also be in for another summer of heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, coral bleaching and forest fires. This will be a crucial year to determine how fast humanity can respond to the growing threat.On 23 September, the UN secretary-general António Guterres will convene a climate summit to urge government leaders to raise their emissions-cutting ambitions, followed on 11 November by the next regular conference of the climate talks, hosted by Chile. Environmental issues will increasingly shape and be shaped by politics. Buffeted by the gilet jaunes protests, the French president Emmanuel Macron has promised to put climate and bioersity high on the agenda of the G7 summit he will host in Biarritz from 25-27 August.If the fossil-fuel championing Donald Trump survives the arrests of his former aides, he is likely to push back against a new bipartisan climate bill and continue unravelling pollution controls for national parks.In China, President Xi Jinping’s promise to create an “ecological civilisation” will be tested by the massive infrastructure investment of the Belt and Road Initiative. Globally, the big question will be whether emissions can finally start to fall after two years of rapid growth. If not, expect fiercer protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion and 350.org.One to watch: Greta Thunberg. In September the Swedish teenager began a solo climate protest by going on strike from school, and more than 20,000 students around the world have joined her.Who knows what she’ll do next – but you can be sure it’ll make the headlines. JW Forecasters have struggled to achieve a consensus about the prospects for 2019. The International Monetary Fund has warned that it could be a terrible year with much of the postwar financial infrastructure being torn apart.Washington’s policy initiatives threaten to jam the cogs of international trade, making companies circumspect about pushing into new markets. Uncertainty over a Brexit deal, the US-China trade tariffs stand-off – which could escalate in the coming weeks after a 90-day moratorium ends – and the battles between Brussels and Italy’s new radical right administration also threaten the old order.Since the 2008 crash, the west has relied on the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Turkey to drive growth, but each is going through political upheaval and struggling to maintain momentum.China, in particular, borrowed heavily from its own banks and the more shadowy elements of the financial sector to fund investment. After a crackdown on easy money, it’s not clear how strong the economy’s growth will be in the future. Yet the IMF, which failed to predict the last crash, stands accused of over-reacting to every morsel of poor economic news. Analysts at Oxford Economics are among many who predict 2019 as a period of steady if unspectacular growth. In this outlook, Donald Trump is more bluster than action, China gets back on track and British politicians will secure a deal or a delay for another referendum vote. The Italian government is already on the road to patching up its differences with Brussels. The worst is already in the past.One to watch: Jerome Powell, the US central bank chief. If Fed rates continue to rise in 2019, money will be sucked into the US from across the world. Developing countries will struggle to find the funds they need to grow. Markets will become more volatile and global growth will slow. If Powell eases back, it will look like he has capitulated to Trump’s bullying, and the Fed’s independence will be in question. Whatever he does, it will have huge implications. PIRobert Mueller’s FBI inquiry into Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia during and after the 2016 US presidential election is expected to conclude in 2019. A key question is to what extent Trump may have lied and conspired to obstruct justice.Faced by similar accusations, Richard Nixon resigned in 1974, rather than be impeached. But Trump may try to brazen it out. Newly empowered Democrats in Congress will increase the pressure, just as the race for the 2020 election kicks off. Expect fireworks.Europe faces great uncertainty. EU parliamentary elections in May may produce further gains for far-right populist and Eurosceptic parties. Key “mainstream” leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron begin the year in a weakened state the former has been replaced as leader of the CDU by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. If there is no Brexit deal, April in Britain could be the cruellest month.Bashar al-Assad’s vow to retake “every inch” of Syrian territory implies an all-out assault is coming on Idlib, the last hold-out province. Many Syrians in Turkey and Jordan appear poised to return home – if the war ends. But the unresolved problem of migrants travelling via north Africa will stoke tensions in Europe. The terrorist threat from Islamic State may intensify as it regroups in Iraq and the Sahel.Efforts to halt the Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict in Yemen will be a race against time. The UN says millions face famine and disease. Much may depend on what happens to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo shows signs of becoming an emergency. China will exploit the geopolitical vacuum caused by America’s distractions as trade tensions persist. Elections are due in India, Afghanistan, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, Argentina and Israel.Northern Syria, Taiwan, Venezuela, Cameroon, and Israel’s borderlands are likely 2019 hotspots. Russia-Ukraine enmities will cause more trouble.One to watch: Iran is in Trump’s cross-hairs, and he could escalate confrontation in 2019 to shift attention from his domestic troubles. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing bribery and corruption allegations, and the Saudi leadership is under withering fire over Yemen and the Khashoggi affair. Both might welcome a chance to bolster their positions by settling scores with Tehran. If hardliners in Iran gain the upper hand and resume nuclear activities banned in 2015, the consequences will be unpredictable – and dangerous. STThe new year will begin in spectacular scientific style when the US probe New Horizons sweeps past the tiny world of Ultima Thule. It will have travelled 4 billion miles to reach the piece of rock about 20 miles in diameter, left over from the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. The data from New Horizons could revolutionise our understanding of planet formation.Further space adventures for 2019 will include the launch of China’s Chang’e 5, a robot mission to collect rocks from the moon, while the US will return to putting humans in space when Elon Musk’s Space X company launches its manned capsule Dragon, and Boeing puts its CST-100 Starliner into orbit. Both will carry crew to the International Space Station. Next year should also see the results of efforts by scientists working on the Event Horizon project to produce images of the super-massive black lurking hole at the centre of our galaxy.The chief medical officer, Sally Davies, has been instructed by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to produce guidelines in the spring on the maximum time young people should spend on social media. Given the lack of research in this area it will be interesting to see what her recommendations will be.One to watch: He Jiankui. The Chinese scientist shocked the world this year when he claimed to have created the world’s first genetically edited babies. He is now under pressure to reveal details of his work, which created an outcry because of the ethical questions it raises.

Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a512556804faedeb95127d5912b8b2bb0726c5ce/0_0_6144_3687/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fafa62c6fb97cbf67f04d11611b29c80","title":"my boyfriend and i are well matched but i just dont fancy him mariella frostrup","story":"He doesn’t seem to be offering you much, so don’t just ‘make do’, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma I have been dating my boyfriend for three months. He is intelligent and thoughtful, sensitive and funny. We are in our 30s and have the same long-term goals – to travel, see where life takes us and not add children to a relationship.I wasn’t physically attracted to him, but the way he treats me convinced me to give it a go. I’m not convinced there’s enough “spark” and find myself inwardly picking apart his appearance and his unwavering devotion to me, which I find soppy and cloying. Some things actively turn me off, for example chewing food loudly with his mouth open and getting food all over his face, or the way he dresses. Then I feel guilty as he would not judge me in the same way.I have dated some very attractive men in the past and valued physical attractiveness probably too highly. Most of these boyfriends were narcissistic and made me feel insecure about my own attractiveness, something I am usually confident about. I am agonising about throwing away a relationship with a man who really adores me.Should I let him go or stick with it?Mariella replies Life can, in some ways, be very short. You’ve written to me at a point in the year when I tend to feel reckless and impatient – “out with the old” becoming my increasingly frenzied mantra! It’s perhaps not the best state of mind to be delivering advice, but happily, in your case, it might be. Normally I’m all about compromise. As I regularly reiterate, few relationships survive the course without epic levels of endurance and tolerance from both parties so, in principle, you’re right to be trying to square the positives with the negatives in this new liaison. Your boyfriend’s assets look impressive on paper, if a little generic. A man who’s thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive and funny isn’t to be sniffed at, but listed thus they sound like a stereotype rather than a personal engagement. Sure, he sounds like a nice guy but, despite the propaganda suggesting otherwise, there are plenty of them about – it’s finding one that’s tuned to your wavelength that counts.What does he have to offer apart from the fact that he’s not a bastard? I appreciate you have to kiss a lot of frogs, but it doesn’t follow that you need to jump at the first man blessed with less cold-blooded characteristics. My sense is that you’re in retreat and making do. I have to restrain my impulse to shout: “Just dump him!”It’s not only you I’m worried about. You say you’ve had your fair share of narcissists who’ve made you feel unattractive. So you’ll be well aware how painful it is to be judged and found wanting. You’ve said you find this guy a bit soppy which suggests he’s eager for your approval and will bruise easily. Why inflict unnecessary pain on a man whose only crime is to have fallen for you with too much enthusiasm? Issues with table manners and dress sense might appear superficial now, but their ability to irritate is likely to increase over the years. In my experience there’s no such thing as a small turn off.We are none of us perfect, which is why falling in love is so seductive because, for a brief time in our lover’s eyes, we feel flawless. Right now you are both still shrouded in mystery to each other, but eventually you’ll be naked, your real selves fully exposed and those early imperfections will join a slew of more onerous ones. Starting with a clean slate and pure worshipful passion is extremely helpful down the line. Those sense memories of perfect union are sometimes all we have to keep going through more challenging times. You need to bank blissful days for future retrieval, like stashing an energy bar in your pocket for a long trek.Passion, as we know, dwindles over time, so the elements that are off-putting now certainly won’t feel less so when repeated a thousand times over. You do need to sweat the small stuff when it comes to enduring companionship. As much as your petty quibbles can become homicide-inducing annoyances, so your judgmental disdain will fester in his heart over months and years. Sure you can change the way he dresses and maybe even retrain him when it comes to his table manners, but refashioning him into an image you desire is hardly likely to make him more appealing to you. A partner whose habits revolt you within the very earliest months of courtship does not bode well.I’m interested in why you’re so keen to settle. You say you want an adventurous life, unshackled by children and commitment. So where’s the upside for you in 1950s-style coupledom? If you feel like taking time out from robust dating to inhabit a calmer more nurturing partnership, there’s no harm in hanging in the doldrums for a while. But don’t dissect him like a laboratory animal. He is what you see before you and if he doesn’t match your standards move on. Finding a fleeting lover can be a treated like a beauty contest, but when it comes to long-term relationships, pretty goddam perfect is the baseline to start the courtship dance on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8506e965886629f14a21952e39b5567dffab08f7/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44f320dc56d388dda5cf1a67736cd526","title":"festive financial hangover get your spending under control in the new year","story":"Avoiding tax fines, ditching overpriced deals on energy and paying more off the mortgage are all excellent ways of boosting your bank balanceWith the wrapping paper tidied away and the final leftovers from Christmas dinner eaten, thoughts turn to fresh beginnings. There are books to read, marathons to run, courses to take and holidays to organise. All may feature on your list of best intentions for 2019 – along with sorting out your finances. Even though the hangover from Christmas spending may not have cleared, the new year gives an opportunity to ensure you are not paying over the odds for services and that you are getting the best value from your energy provider, are on the best savings rates and are making technology work for you.So, as 1 January approaches, here is our guide to making sure 2019 is the year you bring your personal finances under control.First, the boring but important stuff. The end of January marks the deadline for filing your tax return and if you are late you run the risk of fines. Last year, more than 10.6 million people filed returns on time – more than nine out of 10 of those who were due to – but thousands did not. Although there is always a rush of people doing so at the last minute – 30,000 in the final hour last year, said HM Revenue and Customs – it is best to get the job out of the way in advance to avoid both penalties and stress.Paying off debt is one of the most frequent ambitions for the new year. Avoiding getting into more debt should be added to that plan. Be aware of how you spend money and reflective of your situation at any one time. Using credit cards for essentials such as groceries is a warning sign that something is not right. Stick to the golden rule of borrowing: don’t go into debt for something that will last for less time than the amount borrowed takes to pay back. In order to deal with credit card debt, try to pay more than the minimum. If you feel you are in trouble, reach for help from organisations such as National Debtline, Citizens Advice, the Debt Advice Foundation, StepChange and PayPlan. Do it sooner rather than later – many wait too long and their situation worsens.Consumers have long been told that they should switch energy providers, but complaints frequently emerge that the process is more hassle than it is worth. New life has been given to changing this year with a series of companies, dubbed flipping services, that will do it for you automatically, sometimes free and sometimes with a charge. The largest of the new players is Look After My Bills, first featured on Dragons’ Den and launched in January. Flipper was the first of the services, while Migrate and Weflip were launched recently and Labrador has also been building a customer base. Some operate on commission, while other charge a flat fee to households. Consumers should still check whether they can make better savings by themselves before signing up.Mobile phone bills are an area where consumers frequently pay over the odds without their knowledge. Research suggests that many are charged for their phone after their contract ends, even though they then own their phone. Set a reminder for when your contract is up and then get the best sim-only deal on the market for your needs. Keep a close eye on how much data you use and don’t be attracted by deals offering enormous amounts that you do not need. Beware of bundled deals – where the phone and the plan come together – as most result in more being paid for the phone than if it is bought outright. In these deals, consumers are in effect taking a loan from the network in order to pay off the device. Buying a new phone outright – if you are sure you need one – is usually the best idea, but not everyone has the money to do so. For those who can get one, an option is an interest-free credit card, setting up a direct debit to pay it off each month. The minimum monthly payments have to be made to ensure interest charges do not kick in.With the rapid movement of personal banking via smartphones, particularly among younger consumers, has come a raft of new tools to help organise spending. The newly launched N26 app offers transactions, sub-accounts to organise money, and the ability to instantly lock your card if you lose it. Monzo helps set budgets and gives instant notifications as well as typical banking functions such as setting up direct debits and standing orders. Starling Bank also gives real-time notifications and the ability to split bills, and lock and unlock your card. The apps are particularly popular with people used to carrying out everyday tasks on their phone, but older people, more familiar with using (rapidly disappearing) high street banks, may be more sceptical.It is estimated that more than 10 million people are on broadband deals in which there is a price increase at the end, but many do not switch providers as there is a lot of “friction” in moving from one provider to another. The service is often tied up with a TV deal. Most providers do not remind people when their contract is up, so they do not move when the minimum time is up. The comparison site Ctrlio suggests you can save between £180 and £200 a year by switching and that there are good deals if you break up TV and broadband packages, looking for deals on each service inidually. There are also incentives offered to switch, such as Amazon vouchers and cashback, for those who do not have “stickiness” holding them on to a provider."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b6e907e248cfd2e77f5bbe10a7fc026049afd9c/0_309_4684_2809/master/4684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59568ad93b4c72a39eff8756c04a54b1","title":"hmv is a bedrock of the british music industry its loss would affect us all","story":"The retail chain, now in administration for the second time, weaves music culture into the fabric of our cities – something Spotify can never doThis particular music nerd dutifully filled out his HMV application form in April 1997, and on it wrote that his musical hero was the maverick and frequently unlistenable industrial auteur Jim “Foetus” Thirlwell. Amazingly, the manager of the Southampton store appeared not to view this as a reason to hurl the document into the nearest wastebasket.Sixteen years later, when HMV first sank into administration in 2013, it seemed unlikely that such an allegiance would still be viewed as an asset. To a great extent, the company – if not its beleaguered, yet still enthusiastic, workforce – had lost its identity: a long period of turbulence had finally seen HMV ersify into selling jeans and speaker docks to the consternation of many and the delight of few.The casual schadenfreude that followed the announcement of its second bout of administration on Friday was, then, depressingly familiar. However, it belies a crucial change. As a Brexit-blighted Christmas made this near-century-old business one of what’s sure to be several retail casualties, it is nevertheless a markedly leaner and more coherent operation than in its earlier Ozymandian incarnation. In the period since I was made redundant in early 2014, as restructuring firm Hilco took over and the enormous Oxford Street flagship store was replaced by an equally vast Sports Direct, the chain has been downsized. Its focus was shifted back firmly to CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray, the resuscitated realm of vinyl, and specialist markets, particularly in its smaller sister chain, Fopp.Enthusiastic told-you-sos from the independent music sector were conspicuous by their absence this time around. HMV’s large market share forms an irreplaceable component of the UK’s music industry. If it disappears, the distribution companies who feed releases from record labels to stores will have less business, as will the labels, and indeed the artists themselves.Chris Reeder co-runs the UK independent label Rocket Recordings, who recently released an album by heavy rockers Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs. “We’ve just re-pressed it on CD,” he says. “I asked our distributors Cargo where they’d gone, and they said ‘HMV took them all.’ If HMV goes down we don’t even necessarily know whether we’ll be able to sell those.” He says HMV have been “enormously helpful” in getting behind their other releases, such as World Music by psych-rockers Goat. “If we lost HMV, it’d be another massive chunk out of what is already a very precarious business.” HMV staff have told me anonymously that other indie releases were only pressed on CD in the first place because of demand from HMV.But while it may be tempting to reduce complex problems to simple explanations based on hazy memories and anecdotal evidence, the binary concept of noble indie store and profit-hungry corporate HMV is now as outmoded as the skull and crossbones on an 80s LP inner sleeve that proclaimed home taping was killing music.Whatever’s one prejudices or received wisdom, in my experience, HMV remains a place staffed and managed by dreamers, exuberant outsiders and insatiable cultural obsessives with a strong grasp on the finer points of the product they’re selling, and whose greatest satisfaction is introducing a total stranger to fresh lunacy. Someone once wryly remarked that if one works in music retail, they also essentially work in a form of social care, as anyone who’s helped lonely misfits and curious introverts of all ages and walks of life find cultural solace will testify.Given that HMV is the only music store on offer in many British towns, is even the most cynical observer comfortable with the idea of music – this powerful social lubricant and balm for the dispossessed – existing only on stage or in the glow of a screen? Streaming platforms such as Spotify theoretically have infinite choice, but with their curated playlists and recommendations based on prior listening, can compromise serendipitous discovery. The practice of artists selling straight to fans via sites such as Bandcamp similarly doesn’t encourage accidental finds, or provide personal recommendations from a flesh-and-blood staff member.No one could claim that the outlook is cheerful for HMV, even if it survives into 2019 – it has to battle a generational shift to a view of music as freely accessible, one largely devoid of misty-eyed recollections of a loud, brash Aladdin’s cave of discovery. Selling second-hand records would be difficult given it would undermine HMV’s suppliers, yet they must create a record-shop environment in which one can feel enveloped in culture without being assaulted by commerce, perhaps by means of cafes or bars in-store, the likes of which were actually planned before the company first ran into difficulties.Ultimately, whether we need HMV depends on more than just how we feel about the prospect of a mercilessly unscrupulous colossus such as Amazon enjoying a monopoly on what’s left of physical music. It doesn’t just depend on whether we’re happy walking half-empty high streets crippled by skyrocketing rents and fixed business rates. It depends in a broader sense on whether we want to see culture moved from our city centres to a dehumanised online space. Whether our heroes are Jim “Foetus” Thirlwell or Little Mix, I’d like to think we don’t.• Jimmy Martin worked for HMV for nearly 17 years, and now works for London’s Flashback Records.

See our top 10 albums below• Read the Observer critics’ review of 2018 in full hereNot a year goes by without the music industry undergoing rapid change. This year, the UK’s biggest-selling album wasn’t by Ed Sheeran, Adele or even George Ezra, whose Staying at Tamara’s came second it was a film soundtrack about an American circus impresario (see Turkey on my list) – a populist cultural phenomenon you could say was endemic in our times (if you weren’t over-fond), or confirmation of a renaissance in the musical form (if you were). “What a terrible time to be alive if you’re prone to overthinking,” Ezra reckoned. Or Mamma Mia!, as the fourth best-selling album of the year had it.Did this mean that the death of the artist album, so long foretold, was finally upon us? Not quite. But things happened to the formats we listened to in 2018 – disruptions led by US hip-hop. As radio play lost ground to streaming in the US this year, songs were unhitched from the format determined long ago by 45rpm vinyl. Songs seemed to get shorter – the better, some believe, to keep our attention in the competitive churn of Spotify, or to rack up greater numbers of inidual streams to maximise chart positions, or to compete with other distractions (or all three).Albums might have shrunk too. Some of the finest US hip-hop records of the year were brief – by Pusha T (21 minutes!), Vince Staples (23 minutes!) and Earl Sweatshirt (24 minutes!) to name three. Conversely, albums might also be getting longer, as artists decide what works best in this uncharted new territory. Heftier releases by streaming king Drake and Eminem, for two, flew the flag for packing out track listings.Then there was what you might call the telenovela tactic: musical lives played out on social media and TV. Bronx rapper Cardi B (alongside Bad Bunny and J Balvin) deservedly topped the US singles chart again with the juicy Spanish-language I Like It from her eclectic, assured debut album, Invasion of Privacy, breaking more records. She also announced her not-that-secret marriage to fellow rapper Offset of Migos, safely delivered their baby Kulture and, on the eve of Offset’s solo album release, announced the couple’s separation. Coincidence or clever marketing?Many artists across many genres calculated that flooding the market with multiple projects – tracks, guest features, EPs, albums, behind-the-scenes-of-the-videos-videos – was the best way to game the numbers. Step forward honorary Mancunian Ariana Grande, who had, once again, quite a year, both personally and professionally. Her album Sweetener drew critical acclaim and commercial success. Grande followed it with a record-breaking, non-album event track, Thank U, Next, and promised more random releases another, Imagine, has just dropped. Like the climate, pop is only going to get more unpredictable.But whither art? The cut-throat logic of chart metrics didn’t define the entire sonosphere. No matter where you stand on hip-hop, its reigning poet laureate, Kendrick Lamar, won a Pulitzer prize. Things moved forward. Stormzy didn’t release much, but kept Grenfell Tower in the news, started a publishing imprint, and announced scholarships to support black students at Cambridge.Strictures of gender and orientation continued to loosen, as artists who identify in non-binary ways soared beyond the confines of boy-meets-girl. Sharing a pinnacle were Chris – Christine and the Queens’ exploration of 80s-influenced funk R\u0026ampB – and Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer, a frisky, intersectional, “highly melanated” R\u0026ampB-pop record that waved a pair of pink ruched trousers in the name of the differently programmed.Jazz continued its electrifying incursions into pop, with forward-pushing albums from the likes of Sons of Kemet and a double from Kamasi Washington. A very old-fashioned-sounding UK punk record, Idles’ Joy As an Act of Resistance, addressed the ills of 2018 (intolerance, toxic masculinity) and countered them with a heady cocktail of solidarity, radical emotional honesty and leaping about. Some other homegrown creatives kept up Britain’s reputation for non-U creativity, among them Norwich duo Let’s Eat Grandma, with their updated, but still idiosyncratic pop, and Gwenno, who wrote ine songs in Cornish about cheese.There is, officially, more new music being released now than ever before. For a number of artists, the small sums per stream do seem to be adding up too: allowing a wild ersity of sound to flourish in this new online landscape.Tranquillity Base Hotel \u0026amp CasinoA knockout side-swerve from Britain’s best band.Dirty ComputerEclectic, funky and righteous, Monáe stepped out from behind robot alter egos and into the club.Heaven \u0026amp EarthMaking spiritual jazz out of 90s video games was just the start of Washington’s appeal on this double album.Be the CowboyTriumphal pop from US indie rock’s most penetrating writer.BodyThis Australian improv trio is never anything less than superlative.Your Queen Is a ReptileAlternative takes on female power from the sax-tuba-drums powerhouses.Joy As an Act of Resistance“My blood brother is an immigrant”: British punk for 2018.You Were Never Much of a DancerNiche, perhaps, but very beautiful, roiling American primitive guitar music from Brighton.Hope DownsThe debut album from this restless Go-Betweens-influenced Australian guitar band lived up to high expectations.You can’t fault Pasek \u0026amp Paul, on their second hit after La La Land, but it’s distressing that the year’s bestselling album is the soundtrack of a middlebrow movie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee7fd4419b38b8fac9acd823df1203782a1a5c16/0_135_4278_2567/master/4278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33e1b42126e3dad3b8dc9b773e220ecd","title":"tell us how are you preparing for a no deal brexit","story":"As the government announces troops will be on standby we want to hear from readers preparing for a no-deal BrexitThe government has agreed to implement no-deal Brexit plans “in full” as it seeks to allay fears by saying 3,500 troops would be on standby to help in event of any crisis.Some 80,000 emails are going out to businesses and business groups this week with advice about no-deal planning, but what about people at home?Earlier this year we heard from readers who were planning to stockpile food after warnings came from the National Farmers Union and the British Retail Consortium.

It is also understood that cabinet ministers have discussed the option of a delay with senior backbench MPs in both the main parties and that Downing Street is considering scenarios in which a delay might have to be requested from Brussels.One senior Tory backbencher said: “I have had these discussions with ministers. They will not say so in public but of course the option of a delay has to be looked at in detail now. If we are determined to avoid a no deal, and the prime minister’s deal fails, we will have to ask to stop the clock, and that will give time for us to decide to go whatever way we decide thereafter.”The Conservative MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he believed that even if May got her deal through, there would probably be insufficient time to push all the necessary legislation through parliament to allow Brexit to happen smoothly and that a delay might well be necessary. But if her deal were voted down, the need to take up the option of a delay would become a “certainty”. He said: “I think that if she does not get her deal passed, a delay would be inevitable to give more time to avoid a no deal, and also there is the possibility that there would be a referendum, so this would allow for that.”Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said that parliament would need to discuss all options, including a possible delay, if and when May failed to get her blueprint through the Commons. “If the prime minister’s deal is voted down in early January, then we will be just nine weeks away from the date we are due to leave the EU,” Starmer said.“If the deal is rejected, parliament will need to have a very serious debate about how to protect the economy from a no-deal scenario and at this stage nothing should be ruled out.”Any attempt to push back Brexit would anger hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. But most MPs think it would be supported by a majority in parliament to avoid a cliff-edge exit.In the week before Christmas Starmer told the Commons: “I do agree that serious consideration needs to be given to the timetable now set by article 50, because by 14 January we will be just nine weeks away from the proposed date of leaving the EU. On any view, the government will then have to make a choice about what to do next. No plan B has ever been forthcoming.”Brussels has made clear that it would consider putting back the date of Brexit for a good reason, but has stressed that this could not mean reopening negotiations. The EU would be willing to allow extra time for a second referendum to take place.Cross-party groups of MPs have been considering how to force a delay, if the government does not decide to ask for one itself. One idea is that it could be done by tabling an amendment to a Brexit-related motion that would be put forward by ministers if no deal were agreed by 21 January.The Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is campaigning for a second referendum said: “The stark reality is that the principal way of stopping no deal – which is a distinct possibility – is by getting an extension of the article 50 process. The EU is clear – they will grant an extension to allow for a people’s vote, not for further negotiation, so committing to a people’s vote is the way to stop no deal.”Labour is not, yet, officially calling for a delay but is biding its time to see what happens when parliament returns in the second week in January.Meanwhile figures have emerged showing the government has spent more than £4m on consultants to help prepare for leaving the bloc. This includes almost £1.5m on Boston Consulting Group, which in 2016 warned that “a protracted period of uncertainty and volatility seems very likely on many dimensions, including on growth, trade, investment, interest rates, and financial markets”.Susan Elan Jones, a Labour MP and people’s vote supporter, said: “The only people who benefit from the government’s Brexit plan are management consultants and accountants. It’s a bad deal for Britain and a much worse deal than we’ve already got in the EU.”In the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” over Brexit, branding it “entirely unreasonable” to expect Brussels to put forward a solution. The European commission president rejected claims of a plot to keep the UK in the EU.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Juncker said. “It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85129c44dd846cbbed7ec1277b51832228acf260/98_123_3400_2041/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=929b3bf0ed318b04622137f45a6ab5f0","title":"brexit eu deal uk needs to get its act together jean cleaude juncker","story":"It is not up to EU to resolve problems before MPs vote on May’s deal, London toldJean-Claude Juncker has told the UK to “get its act together” in the run-up to the delayed House of Commons vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.The European commission president said the EU could not be expected to resolve the problems that continue to make it likely the British government will suffer a heavy defeat.“I find it entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems,” Juncker said in a wide-ranging interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. “My appeal is this. Get your act together and then tell us what it is you want. Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”May is set to put her deal, including the contentious Irish backstop, to MPs in the week beginning 14 January, following a week of debate in the Commons.The prime minister pulled a planned vote earlier this month when it became clear the government was likely to suffer a heavy defeat.She then promised to secure “legal and political” assurances that the backstop – which would keeping the UK in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard Irish border – would only be temporary, should it need to be triggered.The backstop would come into force at the end of the transition period, during which the UK effectively remains a member state but without a decision-making role, unless an alternative arrangement has been agreed.The EU’s 27 leaders, however, offered May little hope of any significant sweetener to the deal at a summit earlier this month. Juncker’s comments will be a fresh blow to Downing Street’s hopes of a game-changing last-minute concession.Asked whether he would recommend a second referendum to get past the logjam in parliament, Juncker said it was up to the British people to decide. “If the House of Commons backs the withdrawal agreement in mid-January, then we should begin preparations for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union the very next day and not wait until after the official withdrawal date of 29 March.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May. It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum.“I am working on the assumption that it will leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided.”The EU 27 would be prepared to offer an extension to the two-year negotiating period allowed under article 50 of the EU’s treaties to allow for a second referendum, but there is a growing frustration in Brussels over the UK’s tortured exit.The focus in Brussels is instead on the existential threat posed by the rise of populist governments elsewhere in Europe. With May’s elections to the European parliament in mind, Juncker used his new year interview to appeal to the EU’s established political parties not to pander to anti-immigrant populists, and instead support the commission’s proposals on dealing with future migration.“Those who run after the populists will only be seen from behind”, he said. “We must not imply that the populists are right. We have to show them up for what they are by making it abundantly clear that they are just loud and do not have any specific proposals to offer on solving the challenges of our time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffcac19771aa3e6a18eda11cc7753adde3b5935/0_0_2412_1447/master/2412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c0014081f288272fa753e631d3d6d6","title":"food prices to finance what a no deal brexit could mean for britain","story":" journalists spell out the potential impact, sector by sector, on national lifeIf Theresa May fails to get her deal through parliament in January, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal becomes more likely. Here,  journalists examine what a no-deal Brexit could mean for the country, sector by sector.In a no-deal scenario, the rights of British nationals in Europe to work and reside there will fall away unless a member state has contingency plans in place. For this reason many British expats have taken the precaution of becoming citizens of the countries in which they are settled.In its latest no-deal planning paper unveiled earlier this month the European commission urged members to take a “generous” approach to protect the rights of 1 million Britons living in the bloc. It said governments should consider granting temporary residence permits to allow time for people to make applications to secure their long-term status.Campaigners say the EU’s decision to leave the issue of citizens’ rights up to inidual states shows the 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK and the 1 million Britons in Europe have been “abandoned”.Jane Golding, the chair of the campaign group British in Europe, said: “We are appalled to learn that, while aviation and financial services merit an extension of current agreements in the case of no deal, people do not.“This means that there will be no soft landing for over 1.2 million British nationals living on the continent who will have to adjust to life as third-country nationals overnight once all their EU rights have been stripped from them.”Some countries have already announced advanced no-deal plans to protect British nationals.Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, said France would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 resident British citizens living there – provided Britain offered the same guarantees to French expatriates.Theresa May has stated EU citizens settled in the UK will be free to remain. However, some of their rights, including the rights of elderly parents to move to the UK to live with their children, will be diminished.It is difficult to see how ports can continue functioning as before even if the government’s no-deal plans swing seamlessly into place in March.Authorities in France have said even a two-minute delay in Calais will lead to 27km delays in both countries.The Road Haulage Association (RHA) recently said the government was “in denial” over no-deal preparations.As it stands, hauliers entering the country will be required to submit a 40-section declaration form per consignment.Even if the UK decides not to impose checks, they will be mandatory in the other direction.Regional authorities in Hauts-de-France, which includes France’s largest passenger port, its biggest fishing port and the country’s third biggest cargo port, and Kent county council have advanced plans to try and mitigate the catastrophic impact that would have on both country’s economies.Xavier Bertrand, the president of regional council of Hauts-de-France, said a temporary border inspection posts for food controls would be in place for April and that recruitment had begun for the first batch of 250 customs officials.In Dover there is no room for border inspection posts.Kent county council has warned of the chaos that will ensure from the gridlock, impacting the ability of schools, hospitals, morgues and waste collectors to function normally.Paul Carter, the Conservative leader of the council, has said no deal could cause gridlock at Dover and would spread chaos around the country at a cost of almost £1.75bn a week to the economy.Farmers and food producers are among the most vulnerable businesses in a no-deal scenario.First, the supply of seasonal harvest workers, mainly from eastern Europe, on berry and fruit farms, will disappear unless new immigration rules are brought quickly to the statute books.Second, and perhaps of bigger concern to the National Farmers’ Union, is the devastating impact on meat and food exporters.Not only will they face World Trade Organization tariffs with the potential to make their products less competitive on the continent and put them out of business, but EU rules mean they could face a wait of up to six months before they are certified as approved importers to member states.The NFU says it has been told informally that although the UK is in complete regulatory alignment with the EU, if there is no deal, British producers would be subject to the same health checks countries such as China and the US undergo.It has been told that 6,000 meat processing plants that export to the EU will have to undergo inidual audits by British authorities.These will then be checked by EU officials and then put to a standing veterinary committee for approval, a process that the NFU has calculated will take six months “at a conservative reading”.The BVA warned the proposed £30,000 salary threshold for EU workers could lead to “a near-total wipeout” of vets in critical public health roles in UK slaughterhouses.Hotels, pubs, cafes, restaurants and other venues face a double whammy from a no deal.Not only do they heavily rely on EU citizens to work in their kitchen, front-of-house, service and cleaning roles, but they will also, like the rest of the nation, face a potential increase in food prices.Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Federation, warned this week that hospitality would be heavily hit by immigration plans.UK Hospitality’s chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said the £30,000 minimum salary proposed by the government would “shrink the talent pool and hit every aspect of hospitality from hotels, restaurants and bars, to the cost of people’s morning coffee”.Keeping supermarket shelves full and food prices down will be one of the biggest challenges faced by retailers in the days after a disorderly Brexit.Earlier this year Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, suggested queues and delays at UK and EU ports would be one the biggest problems faced by clothing chains if the need for increased customs declarations created a logjam. Clothing prices could also rise if another currency shock pushes up costs for retailers which import goods in dollars.“It is not yet clear how well prepared HMRC systems, customs and other relevant personnel will be for the upcoming potential increase in workload and data capture,” said Wolfson, a prominent Vote Leave supporter.Manufacturers account for a tenth of annual British output, but the nation’s producers are among the most exposed to Brexit turmoil if the UK leaves without a deal. Many industrial firms rely on imported parts made in Europe and the threat of chaos at Dover is forcing them to make contingency plans. Some parts cross the Channel multiple times before being installed in cars or aircraft.Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine maker, is stockpiling parts and moving some regulatory approvals to Germany. More than 200 UK aerospace manufacturers have applied to come under the jurisdiction of regulators in other EU countries in preparation for a possible hard Brexit.For carmakers, a major part of the UK manufacturing base, their contingency measures may need to be more drastic. BMW has talked of moving its Mini plant from outside Oxford to the Netherlands, while there is speculation Nissan might move production from Sunderland to France. Temporary factory shutdowns across the UK, including Jaguar Land Rover in the West Midlands and Honda in Swindon, are also being mooted.If the “just in time” supply chains used by manufacturers stretch or break because of delays at ports it will be costly. Airbus has warned that just a week’s delay will cost €1bn, while smaller manufacturers are scrambling to secure loans from banks for extra working capital as they stockpile.Manufacturers of perishable products such as food and pharmaceuticals are particularly nervous, with a surge in demand for cold storage.A no-deal Brexit would leave Britain’s financial services sector without a replacement for passporting rights, meaning banks would be blocked from selling their services freely across EU borders.In the UK, European firms will be able to continue operating while they apply for local licensing but there will not be a similar a deal for British firms. There is no sign of that temporary relief being reciprocated for UK firms which have clients in the EU.Most UK-based banks and insurers have been planning for the worst-case scenario from the start. This has meant applying for EU licences, putting UK employees on standby for relocation to mainland Europe, and hiring a raft of new workers for new or expanded EU operations.John McFarlane, who is chairman of both Barclays and the lobby group TheCityUK, said earlier this month that “every single large bank is prepared to move by March if they have to”.Energy would almost certainly keep flowing across the undersea links between the UK, France and the Netherlands in the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, industry insiders have warned it would introduce more friction in electricity trading. The impact could be much more serious in the case of Northern Ireland as internal government documents have warned it could face blackouts while new cross-border arrangements are drawn up.Leaving without a deal would see the UK crashing out of the EU’s flagship climate programme, the Emissions Trading System. The Treasury has said it would impose a unilateral carbon tax on electricity generators to compensate for the exit. No deal would therefore mean some modest relief for coal and gas power station owners, because the UK plans a charge of £16 a tonne of carbon, versus the current €23 a tonne under the EU scheme.However, no deal would pose headaches for the nuclear sector, both in terms of freedom of movement for skilled workers and the transport of nuclear materials across borders. Research into nuclear fusion, in which the UK is considered a world leader in, would also be hit.Airlines have been reassured by the pledge of an immediate bare bones deal for EU-UK flights in the event of a hard Brexit, which would last at least a year. The Association of British Travel Agents and the government have been keen to counter reports that a no-deal Brexit could see holidays jeopardised. The €7 visa for EU trips will not be necessary for Britons until 2021.Eurostar has said it is working closely with government to ensure a bilateral agreement is signed allowing it to continue services after March, and is confident it will maintain its existing timetables.Hauliers have been applying to enter a lottery for clearance to operate in Europe, known as ECMT permits, which would allow a limited number of firms to keep trading abroad. EU proposals to extend the movement of goods until December 2019 have taken some pressure off, but they have not been ratified and also would not necessarily permit UK firms to operate between EU countries or to travel to countries beyond.Given the NHS’s pivotal role, its preparations for minimising the effects of a no-deal Brexit are among the most advanced, and most dramatic, of any area of national life. Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank who has researched the subject extensively, says that “a large degree of chaos” would inevitably befall the health service under no deal.The Department of Health and Social Care’s 33 pages of guidance, sent to NHS bodies in England in December, outlines key areas that no-deal contingency planning has been focusing on. Among the key worries is inability to access medicines. Drug companies have thus been ordered to build up stockpiles of extra medications, enough to last six weeks. The department is meanwhile helping companies pay for the storage space needed. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said last week he had become “the largest buyer of fridges in the world”.Hancock is also chartering a plane to fly in important medical supplies that have a short shelf life, such as radioisotopes used in cancer care and gene therapies. And NHS bosses fear the impact of any form of Brexit, but particularly a no-deal version, on their vital supply of staff from the EU.All told, a no-deal Brexit would also add £2.3bn to the NHS’s annual running costs, Dayan has calculated. That includes a £1.75bn hike in the price of medicines.Dayan puts it like this: “Given all this would come immediately after another winter of financial pressure and strained bed capacity, we would expect the months around a no-deal Brexit to be among the most difficult in the 70-year history of the NHS.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517a4cd381c3b01a9c2fc30a7a537d4aee0d062/0_66_3911_2346/master/3911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbd9eafee974cb98679814139fc5d23e","title":"heavyweight boxing tiger woods caster semenya russia sporting predictions 2019","story":"“It is dangerous to make predictions, especially about the future.” Some attribute that quote to Mark Twain.

Especially as he has won at Augusta four times, and has victories at Bethpage Black, which will host the US PGA, and Pebble Beach, which will stage the US Open. If his back holds up, watch out: Woods’ 15th major is on.If boxing followed the rules of logic or the free market, Anthony Joshua would fight Tyson Fury at Wembley in April, followed by the winner meeting Deontay Wilder in an autumn mega-fight for the unified heavyweight title. It sounds so simple, doesn’t it – the best taking on the best at their best – yet a swamp of boxing politics and arguments over money needs to be waded through first. With Joshua most likely to face Dillian Whyte next, the prospect of him taking on his two biggest rivals before 2020 looks slim.When I was young I spent summers with a cricket bat in hand and winters listening to Test Match Special and playing Test Match – the “authentic action-packed table top cricket game, officially endorsed by the England Test team” – the game’s original Big Bash. I bet there were thousands of others like me, too. And while cricket is not nearly as loved or cherished these days, there is a obvious chance for a recalibration in 2019 given that England are favourites for a home World Cup and an Ashes series is also looming. Whatever happens, any measure of success must go beyond victories and trophies. And with no free-to-air matches, how many kids will be able to distinguish Joe Root from Joe Bloggs, or want to pick up a bat themselves?Providing England’s Lionesses do well – and they are ranked fourth according to Fifa’s rankings – then the Women’s World Cup should be a breakthrough moment for women’s football in England. Already there is a powerful momentum – when England reached the semi-finals four years ago a peak audience of 2.4 million watched them lose to Japan, while their Euro 2017 semi-final against the Netherlands on Channel 4 had over four million viewers, the biggest ever British audience for a women’s football match. With BBC holding the rights for France 2019, expect the game to take another big leap forward if England can make the semis again.Since the start of the 2004 season, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic have won an astonishing 50 of the 60 grand slams between them, with Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka picking up another six. Yet with Federer 37, and Nadal and Murray struggling with injuries for much of 2018, some believe that the golden generation is finally losing its shine. I don’t see it myself. At least not yet. Remember Djokovic only lost three times in the last six months (although all three defeats came against players aged 22 and under) while Nadal is still a monster on clay. Meanwhile Serena Williams will expect to finally surpass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slams in 2019 – even at 37.Despite all the twists of the past four years the Russian doping scandal will linger in 2019. For while the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was controversially reinstated by Wada in September it still hasn’t handed over all the data stored in its Moscow Laboratory by 31 December as promised, and faces being suspended again. Rusada’s director general, Yury Ganus, has warned that Russia is “on the brink of the abyss” and faces having its athletes banned from competing at major events, but I don’t see that apocalyptic scenario playing out. The International Olympic Committee doesn’t want Russia out in the cold, after all, so expect some goalpost-shifting or messy compromise again.The court of arbitration for sport will finally rule on Caster Semenya’s case against athletics’ governing body, the IAAF, in March. But whatever it decides it provoke ire – and possibly chaos. The IAAF argues that intersex athletes have a massive and unfair advantage because their bodies produce far more testosterone than other women. Semenya’s supporters point out that is hardly her fault. Either way, the IOC will be watching closely – for Cas’s ruling over how much testosterone matters in sport could have ramifications not only for intersex athletes, but transgender ones too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a078ea694c0166ffb6371725d70243ac6877cb63/1177_80_2163_1297/master/2163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4dcfe385d24a1230ba5bd2602a3a718","title":"roger federer belinda bencic hopman cup britain tennis","story":"Roger Federer outplayed Britain’s Cameron Norrie 6-1, 6-1 to secure a winning start for defending champions Switzerland at the Hopman Cup in Perth on Sunday.Gearing up for his Australian Open title defence, Federer overcame three break points in his opening service game before rediscovering his rhythm to race out to a 5-0 lead.

For the image speaks so volubly of his continuing industry: the swatches of fabric behind his desk the drawer beneath it, full to bursting with ribbons and buttons above all, the master’s intense, almost dreamy concentration as he contemplates the bolt of red silk wrapped so pleasingly around Daouphars’s tiny frame.By this point, of course, Coco Chanel, who regarded Dior’s designs as an affront to liberated women, was snapping at his heels she launched her trademark suit in 1954. But why would he have cared? His influence, then as now, could not have been overstated. In February 1947, at 30 Avenue Montaigne, Dior had unveiled what would come to be known as the New Look (a phrase coined by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar). Overnight, its full skirts and nipped-in waists redefined women’s silhouettes it would go on to revitalise the Paris fashion industry. In Britain, Dior’s clients included Margot Fonteyn and Nancy Mitford the gown worn by Princess Margaret when she was photographed by Cecil Beaton to mark her 21st birthday was by Dior.In February, the V\u0026ampA will open the biggest exhibition ever staged in the UK on the house of Dior. It will trace the couturier’s influence, as well as that of the six designers who went on to succeed him at the fashion house, and it will look, too, at his love affair with Britain (he found tweeds so fetching – though it’s possible he was just being polite). Above all, it will (I hope) capture the excitement felt by war-weary women across Europe as they realised hemlines were set to drop – and drop. “My skirts are a release,” Dior insisted, and in a way, he was right. However cumbersome, they were also a sign that life, having been so hard for so long, was about to get a little better.Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams is at the V\u0026ampA, London, from 2 February-14 July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b971caee3bc284c931b82616aa1403f85825fde5/0_54_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6741bf9ebe1e03148e58f1a9a89bb437","title":"miranda sawyer best audio podcasts radio 2018","story":"Podcasts marched on apace while radio presenters engaged in an elaborate game of musical chairs. See our top 10 list below• Read the Observer critics’ review of 2018 in full hereA tsunami of podcasts this year, as the BBC and other institutions gave us show after show to make up for past reticence. Some podcasts were oversold (Death in Ice Valley, The Ratline), others an unexpected delight (GrownUpLand., Duvet Days). Business joined in the new audio rush – Land Rover’s innovative family show, Discovery Adventures, won several awards – and everyone you met seemed to be launching a podcast of their own.True crime and real-life story podcasts rumbled on successfully, with Australian show The Teacher’s Pet causing a stir when Chris Dawson, its main subject, was arrested and charged with murdering his wife. The genre is now so ubiquitous that the Onion released a funny mickey-take, A Very Fatal Murder.Other thriving podcast genres include famous-person-talks-to-a-mate (George Ezra and Friends Table Manners With Jessie Ware) and trying-to-understand-life-chats (Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness, excellent Russell Brand’s Under the Skin is still very popular).In radio land there was much hoo-ha and upheaval. Virgin, LBC, Beats 1 radio and Capital Xtra pinched some big BBC names (Chris Evans, Eddie Mair, Charlie Sloth and DJ Semtex respectively). The BBC responded by doing what it should have done long ago: giving jobs to women. Only Mair’s replacement was male: Evan Davis, doing well on Radio 4’s PM. On Radio 2, Zoë Ball and Sara Cox start their new jobs in the new year, on breakfast and Drivetime on Radio 1, Tiffany Calver took over The Rap Show, with the BBC doing its own poaching by pinching Rickie, Melvin and Charlie from Kiss FM (all start next year, too). Radio 6 Music did an internal shuffle, giving 2019 weekday mornings over to Lauren Laverne and Mary Anne Hobbs.Much of this was a fallout from a combination of last year’s BBC pay revelations, national outrage over a lack of gender equality, and Ofcom finally informing the BBC that it’s legally required to reflect the ersity of the UK. The fuss that has accompanied the changes shows that radio is still close to our hearts and that presenters matter to listeners.News shows certainly had plenty to talk about. Brexit and Trump have spawned so many programmes that they should be given their own categories at next year’s awards shows. Longer-form series continued to thrive, with Slow Burn’s painstaking analysis of the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair a summer highlight. Radio 4’s Today and the  both brought out their own excellent versions of the New York Times’s The Daily news podcast. But news in general had a tough year. Listeners became sick of false equivalence – putting charlatans up against experts in the name of balance – and turned instead to music, podcasts or phone-in shows with presenters who allowed everyone to let off steam (5 Live’s Your Call James O’Brien, Iain Dale et al on LBC).What else? Apps. A lot of ’em, including the BBC’s new Sounds app (some basic errors led to a less than rapturous reception), Global’s Player (not bad) and Google’s podcast app – great if you have an Android phone and Google Home.There was a general feeling of investment in audio this year – intellectual and fiscal. It’s not quite a gold rush yet. It’s still hard for independent podcast-makers to make money, but the listeners are out there, and audio is creatively busy. Next year should be exciting.Producer-presenter Audrey Gillan’s beautiful, in-depth series on a couple living on the streets of east London.The ’s daily news podcast, expertly presented by Anushka Asthana, has become an instant must-listen.The disturbing story of a contemporary Canadian cult hidden behind a be-your-best-self learning programme.Insightful psychotherapist Perel with a third series of her in-the-same-room relationship therapy sessions.This engaging programme, presented by three women with cancer, got all too real in September when presenter Rachael Bland died.Writer-director Julian Simpson’s clever reimagining of an HP Lovecraft horror story as a true crime podcast.

He did so after a law designed to take authority from incoming secretary of state Jocelyn Benson failed to make it out of the state House. A plan to create a “shadow” state board of education controlled by Republicans met the same fate in the Senate.Snyder did sign several bills that reduce voters’ power. They included significant alterations to citizen-initiated laws that mandated paid sick time and raised the minimum wage, and legislation to make ballot drives nearly impossible.“They may not have taken power from incoming electeds but they did take significant power from people and that’s important to highlight,” Democratic state representative Yousef Rabhi told the , adding that he was stopping short of praising anyone in the Republican party.“They were planning to set the house on fire so it’s sort of weird to applaud them for not burning it down,” he said.The legislation targeting Benson would have shifted her authority over campaign finance to a commission made up of three Republicans and three Democrats appointed by legislative leaders. With partisan gridlock baked in, that would have effectively killed enforcement of campaign finance laws. Senator Dave Robertson, who introduced the bill, has a history of campaign finance violations and his former chief of staff is under investigation for embezzlement.The bill designed to strip power from Nessel would have given the legislature authority to intervene in lawsuits challenging unpopular legislation. Campaigning, Nessel said she would not use state resources to fight for laws she sees as unconstitutional, like one that allows adoption agencies to choose not to work with same-sex couples.Legal experts who spoke with the  said the legislation would have violated the Michigan constitution’s separation of powers clause. Snyder appeared to acknowledge that in his veto letter, stating that the executive branch is responsible for managing the “litigation position of the state as an entity”.Snyder’s vetoes and Republican ambivalence to some more draconian bills came amid intense opposition from state residents, including some Republicans. Democratic representative Stephanie Chang said that had an impact.“What’s great is that there were so many people paying attention,” she said. “There were people at the capitol protesting and watching what was going on … and there were definitely Republicans who decided to vote ‘no’ because of the conversation.”Still, the GOP took some victories. They included the passage of two bills to gut citizen-initiated legislation to mandate paid sick time and raise the state minimum wage to $12 per hour, for all workers, including those receiving tips, by 2022. Instead, minimum wage will be raised to $12.05 by 2030 and tipped workers’ pay will be capped at $3.58 per hour. Republicans exempted around 1 million workers from mandated sick time and cut the number of mandated days from nine to four.Two citizen-led groups each collected around 400,000 signatures to put the minimum wage and sick time proposals on the November ballot. The GOP made the proposals law in September before gutting them in lame duck. A legal challenge is likely as Democrats contend the state constitution prohibits changes to citizen-initiated laws in the same session.There were five citizen-led ballot initiatives in 2018. Voters approved proposals to expand voting access, decriminalize marijuana and establish an independent redistricting commission. Republican attempts to alter those proposals mostly failed, but the legislature narrowly passed a new law that will make ballot initiatives far more difficult."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c6ee44c8765ab03d95a8a37165c8e17a64f8b22/0_461_7689_4613/master/7689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d36d2cb9a1f9db6432d794e840881530","title":"china slowing economy and inequality force new priorities for rulers","story":"Leaders of world’s second-largest economy face some of their most difficult policy decisions in years in 2019To make ends meet, Xu Yuan, 33, has to share a bed with her best friend in Shanghai where she works in marketing. A curtain marks her half of the bed. She stays at work as late as possible every day, going home only to sleep. “Neither of us is happy but we have to be tolerant,” she says.Liu Xun, 26, a video editor in Beijing, does not watch movies in cinemas, buy new clothes, or date. “To be honest, I think having a girlfriend is too expensive,” he says. Hillary Pan, who works in media, says she no longer eats at restaurants and buys a meal from the convenience store 7-11 almost every day.China’s economy is slowing and it is people like Xu, Liu, and Pan who are feeling the impact. They are among the many regular Chinese who have had to cut back as the world’s second-largest economy experiences its worst downturn since the 2008 global financial crisis.“People have started to reduce or even stop spending money because they don’t expect the economy will perform well,” said Ye Tan, an independent economist based in Shanghai. “Companies and iniduals are wary about the economy.”Going into 2019, China faces not just a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the US, a pile of debt that threatens the world economy along with the Chinese financial system, and a populace demanding better environmental, labour, and health protections.Next year, China’s leaders face some of the most difficult policy decisions they have had to make in years. Analysts say they are confronting a choice between pushing headline growth through Beijing’s traditional levers of infrastructure spending funded by debt, or painful reforms that lower financial risk but raise the possibility of unemployment, and ultimately social instability.Yet economic indicators from auto sales to manufacturing activity are all flashing red. In November, growth in China’s manufacturing sector stalled for the first time in more than two years. Annual auto sales in the world’s largest car market are on track to contract for the first time since 1990.Chinese stocks, more a measure of confidence than the real economy, have been some of the worst performing this year, losing $2tn (£1.58tn) in value. Factories have dismissed workers months early for the Chinese New Year holiday in February. Real estate, one of the few areas in which regular Chinese people can invest, has also suffered, causing developers to slash prices.An economic slowdown is especially sensitive in China, where social stability is often described as contingent on the government’s ability to deliver continued growth. In September, propaganda officials ordered Chinese journalists to refrain from reporting on signs of a slowing economy, the US-China trade war, or anything portraying the “difficulties of people’s lives”.But those difficulties are hard to contain. As property developers have cut prices to stimulate sales, homeowners in cities across China have staged protests. Worker protests are also widespread. China Labour Bulletin (CLB), which tracks labour activism in the country, found that strikes and protests have spread beyond the manufacturing sector to the service and retail industries between 2013 and 2017, over the course of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping’s first term.The group recorded 1,640 industrial strikes or protests in 2018, about 400 more than last year, a figure that is not meant to be representative of all strikes in the country.“If you look at the nature of these protests, the vast majority can be linked in some way to the slowing economy. Protests are triggered by the failure of employers to pay wages on time, factory closures and the collapse of businesses in the service sector,” said Geoffrey Crothall of CLB.China has begun measures to shore up the economy through tax cuts for consumers to encourage spending, subsidies for jobless young people, and giving companies who do not lay people off refunds in unemployment insurance.But that may not be enough to deal with another problem hindering the economy: an uneven distribution of wealth. For the last 30 years of China’s economic growth, wealth has gone into the hands of local governments and local elites who hold on to the money rather than spend it, argues the economist Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University’s Guanghua school of management.“If you want to fix China’s problems, it’s simple. You have to transfer that wealth from elites to ordinary Chinese,” he said. “That’s always been the difficult part, managing the transfer of wealth.”In some ways, China has reverted to its old playbook of opening the taps. Earlier this year, China ordered state banks to lend to small and medium-sized businesses that have previously struggled to access credit. In the third quarter, planners approved 45 new infrastructure projects worth 437.4bn yuan ($63bn), up from 90.5bn yuan in the previous quarter.Analysts, optimistic China will deliver on promised reforms and continue its campaign to reduce bad debt, say these measures show China’s restraint and new priorities.“I think the GDP growth target that has been a fixation for 20, 30 years is no longer as much a fixation for all levels of the government. I think they are much more willing to tolerate slower growth rates,” said Damien Ma, co-founder of the thinktank MacroPolo at the Paulson Institute in Chicago.He said: “The social contract has evolved under Xi Jinping. It’s no longer about growth … it is healthcare, education, clean air, clean water, quality of life issues.” Referring to a measure of particulate matter in the air, an indicator of pollution, he added: “Over the next five to 10 years the PM2.5 targets will be more important than the GDP target.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b9dfcbaf30d9895de7b9813cf6a365240eb92f/63_459_5069_3041/master/5069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b62d5d7187dfefdb7dad8d9b3bf92e87","title":"colombia possible plot to assassinate pm ivan duque venezuela","story":"Minister says security services believe Venezuelans were linked to plot to kill conservative leaderColombian authorities are investigating an alleged plot involving Venezuelans to assassinate the country’s president, Iván Duque, a senior official has said.The foreign minister, Carlos Holmes, said Colombia’s intelligence services had heard of an alleged plan to kill the conservative Duque. He said the recent arrests of three Venezuelans in possession of assault weapons had increased authorities’ concern.“With immense concern and the utmost condemnation, I want to inform the international community that, in effect, for the past several months, intelligence investigations have been taking place about possible attacks on the president’s life,” Holmes said in a video posted on Twitter.Blu Radio reported that the Venezuelans arrested in the northern Caribbean cities of Valledupar and Barranquilla this month had in their possession an assault rifle with a telescopic sight, a 9mm mini Uzi submachine gun, ammunition and a stun grenade.Citing sources it did not identify, Blu said any alleged plot would have likely had the support of armed Colombian leftwing rebels or drug-trafficking organisations and would have coincided with the start of the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s second term next month.Holmes’ 90-second video did not cite any evidence and carefully avoided saying whether authorities had verified the existence of any conspiracy.There was no immediate reaction from Venezuela’s government.Holmes appealed to Colombians to share any information that could affect the president’s safety. He also thanked unidentified foreign intelligence agencies for helping to protect Duque.Duque, who took office in August, has been leading a diplomatic effort in Latin America to isolate Venezuela’s socialist government as Maduro looks to cement his hold on power despite a devastating economic crisis. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country to escape widespread food shortages and hyperinflation.Colombia, the US and several other foreign governments say Maduro’s election victory in May amid an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging was illegitimate and are urging him to call new elections in which all of his opponents, several of whom have been exiled or banned from holding office, be allowed to run.Maduro has recently accused neighbouring Colombia of plotting with the US to topple him from power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33331792739bec1844c9b94f666ecdeabf367ad8/0_235_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7f207292011de65105f1d5dd8dfeea3","title":"trappist monks devise system to make beer without wasting water","story":"Monastery producing 10m litres a year invents plant-based recycling systemKoningshoeven abbey is one of only 12 places in the world to brew Trappist beer, and its products have won over drinkers around the world.For all the commercial success, however, a nagging sense that money has triumphed over spirituality has prompted the monks to rethink their use of water after more than 130 years.The Cistercian monastery on the Dutch-Belgian border is the first brewery in western Europe to construct a plant-based water filtration system that avoids the current waste of seven litres of water for every litre of beer produced.In a large greenhouse, 70 species, including ferns and other sub-tropical plants, sit above bins of waste water that flows through pipes from the brewery. The interaction of the micro-organisms on the plants’ roots and the bacteria in the water purifies it for reuse.“We are praying seven times a day to praise the Lord for his creation, but we were not working in the right way to stop pollution,” said Father Isaac of his brewery. “We have had to translate our faith into sustainability.”Only beer brewed with a monastery’s walls is authentically Trappist, and the Koningshoeven abbeyproduces 10m litres (18m pints) a year.It is one of just 12 abbeys producing Trappist beer. There are six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands and one each in Austria, the US, France and Italy.It is hoped that the new system, which has been officially consecrated, willpurify around 450,000 litres every seven hours when fully operational without any need for human intervention.The abbey plans to further reduce the monks’ ecological footprint in a less palatable way. “We want to be able to purify human waste water to turn it into drinking water,” said Father Isaac. “I feel a big responsibility for the next generation, and we need to ensure they inherit a cleaner world.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to collision near GlanmireMove proposed as settlement to knock-on claim on foot of deal with nurses in 2016The beast from the east and summer drought characterise a topsy-turvy yearNot all affected couples to receive assistance as they will have to meet \u0026lsquocertain criteria\u0026rsquoTotal of 149 killed to date compares with 157 killed on roads in 2017\u0026lsquoWe have 31 local authorities and they are all implementing it differently\u0026rsquoStudy for larger scheme at Kilmacanogue, Co Wicklow to go aheadUK to spend more than \u0026pound100m chartering extra ferries to ease congestion at DoverLibyan foreign minister snubbed Irish diplomat in Tripoli in wake of \u0026lsquoEksund\u0026rsquo incidentGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to attack at Ballyowen Lane, LucanDepartment to issue guidelines to GPs on how long sick certs should typically lastRover list included research into database of more than a million dogsManager of service station in Tralee that sold ticket welcomes \u0026lsquofantastic\u0026rsquo newsFamily of five told to leave Dublin homeless accommodation over \u0026lsquoongoing incidents\u0026rsquoFines to start next week for sites that could be used for development of thousands of housesThirty doctors signed up do not want HSE to give their details out to avoid being targeted picks of the year: From the Charleton tribunal to the housing crisisFormer taoiseach sought red carpet for Abbeville lawn from Aer RiantaDinner at Dublin Castle for Mitterrand was an \u0026lsquoexceptional\u0026rsquo occasion allowed to exceed the government limit on entertainment spendingDiplomat recounts \u0026lsquoneck-reddening\u0026rsquo invective from Tory backbencher on a train journey"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744350.1546101071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public funding for ivf treatment set aside says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatment in Ireland is currently available only to private patients, who are struggling with fertility.

somebody who already has children, and you are going to prioritise maybe younger women who for medical reasons can’t conceive as opposed to somebody who is in their 50s and 60s who wants to have a child, so there will have to be criteria and there will still be an out-of-pocket contribution, but we have set aside some funding next year to get that started.“You don’t necessarily need the

Photograph: EPAOn October 8th, 1993, British prime minister John Major delivered a speech on morality to the Conservative Party conference. He said it was “time to get back to basics, to self-discipline and respect for the law, to consideration for others, to accepting a responsibility for yourself and your family”.His speech had an immediate impact and it became known as the “back to basics” policy. But Major’s timing was unfortunate. The Tories were beset with scandals – some financial, but mostly sexual – over the next three years. As the wife of one exposed Conservative philanderer said, “that’s back to basics gone to buggery”.A quarter century on, the Tories’ ideological cousin on the other side of the world – Australia’s Liberal-National coalition government – is in the midst of its own back to basics moralising, with equally schadenfreude-friendly results.At the start of 2018, when Barnaby Joyce was still leader of the National Party, he was revealed to be having an affair with a staff member, who was pregnant. Malcolm Turnbull, who was still prime minister then, announced a ban on government ministers having sex with staff. The stable door was bolted long after the horse had left.Andrew Broad was then a Nationals backbencher known only, if at all, for his contribution to the same-sex marriage debate: “I can put the rams in a paddock and they might mount one another, but no lambs will come out.”Broad broadened his philosophical musings to heterosexual relationships, quoting the late American evangelist Billy Graham to say of Joyce: “When wealth is lost, nothing is lost when health is lost, something is lost, when character is lost, everything is lost . . . Telling words for the leadership of the National Party.”His intervention still didn’t make Broad a household name, but he was made a minister in the reshuffle after Turnbull was deposed and Scott Morrison became prime minister in August.Everybody knows who Broad is now, though, after revelations in New Idea magazine (a publication known more for celebrity gossip than investigative journalism) about his use of a “sugar baby” website and the salacious messages he allegedly sent to “blonde beauty Amy”, who is almost 20 years younger than him. Broad, who is married, resigned as assistant minister to the deputy prime minister on December 17th and said he would not stand for re-election next May.Before flying to Hong Kong to meet Amy Keating – who is reportedly Irish – Broad allegedly messaged her on WhatsApp to ask “Do you like Aussie accents?” She replied: “I love Aussie accents, I think they’re so sexy.” Broad allegedly replied: “I pull you close, run my strong hands down your back, softly kiss your neck and whisper g’day mate.”In another message, Broad allegedly said: “I’m a country guy, so I know how to fly a plane, ride a horse, f**k my woman. My intentions are completely dishonourable.”In Hong Kong, Keating says, Broad referred to himself as James Bond during their date but then complained about the prices at the restaurant they were dining in. Whether he ordered a martini “shaken, not stirred” is not known.O’Sullivan withdrew his comment and was allowed to remain in the chamber, but Di Natale refused to withdraw and was suspended from parliament. Hanson-Young said O’Sullivan had tried to “slut-shame” her.Later in November, the industrial relations minister Kelly O’Dwyer told colleagues at a private meeting, the details of which were leaked, that the Liberals are widely regarded as “homophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers”. In parliament the next day, O’Dwyer said, with a straight face, “This government is the natural government for Australian women. We represent their hopes and aspirations.”Opposition Labor MPs erupted with laughter when O’Dwyer made the claim. Julia Banks did not look up from her seat on the crossbenches. She had just resigned from the Liberals after speaking out about sexist bullying and “a culture of appalling behaviour”.Having lost Banks, there are now just 12 women out of 74 on the government side. On the opposition benches, 28 out of 69 Labor MPs are women. In the upper house, more than half of the Labor senators are women.For the Liberal-National government, the year is ending just as it begun - trouble with a staff member at the centre of it. A Nationals adviser is on “indefinite leave” after sending a text to journalist calling her a “feminist c**t” and “bitch” and wishing her family dies “of painful cancer”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3744405.1546155479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit juncker tells uk to get your act together","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker attends a news conference earlier this month in Brussels. File photograph: ReutersJean-Claude Juncker has called on the United Kingdom to “get your act together” over Brexit, branding some Britons “entirely unreasonable” for expecting Brussels to put forward a solution.The European Commission president also rejected claims of a plot to keep the UK in the EU “by all possible means” and revealed he fears the majority of MPs “deeply distrust” both the EU and Theresa May. Mr Juncker’s comments to German newspaper Welt am Sonntag were published as British cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox said the chances of Britain leaving the European Union will be little more than “50-50” if UK prime minister Theresa May’s deal is rejected by Parliament.Mr Fox, the international trade secretary, warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May’s deal would be “incendiary” and said it was “a matter of honour” for them to support her.MPs are due to vote on the withdrawal agreement in the week of January 7th after Mrs May, facing the prospect of a significant defeat, pulled the original date of December 11th.However the bid to buy more time to secure key concessions on the Irish backstop, the key flashpoint for DUP and Brexiteer detractors of the deal, appeared to falter when her fellow leaders refused to change the legal text of the agreement.The PM said talks would continue, although the EU has repeatedly warned negotiations over the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Should MPs reject it when they vote in the coming weeks, it could raise the prospect of no-deal and with it the risk of heavy economic consequences for the UK and EU, or a second referendum on Brexit.Mr Juncker said: “It is not us who are leaving the United Kingdom — it is the United Kingdom that is leaving the European Union.“I find it entirely unreasonable for parts of the British public to believe that it is for the EU alone to propose a solution for all future British problems.“My appeal is this: get your act together and then tell us what it is you want. Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decide if the final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum.However, he said he was “working on the assumption that (the UK) will leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Mr Fox told the Sunday Times that Brexit will only be “100 per cent certain” if the House of Commons backs the prime minister’s deal in a crunch vote next month.Having given the public the right to decide on EU membership in a referendum, “parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on that result”, he said. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPAA Government department has spent more than £100 million on ferries to ease potential problems in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Documents outlining the £107.7 million (€120 million) agreements say increased border checks in UK ports after Brexit could “cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed” in the event of no deal.The move was described as “complete madness” by the Liberal Democrats, who said it showed public money was being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome.The Department for Transport (DfT) has signed contracts with French firm Brittany Ferries, Danish company DFDS and the UK’s Seaborne to ease pressure on Dover.The additional crossings are understood to be the equivalent of around 10 per cent of the current traffic on the Dover Strait and will see ports in Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Immingham and Felixstowe used.Contracts were not put out to tender, with the DfT saying it was a “situation of extreme urgency” brought about by “unforeseeable events”.The contract with Brittany Ferries is worth £46.6 million (€51.77 million), with the company adding 19 return sailings to three routes between the UK and France. More sailings will travel between Roscoff and Plymouth, Cherbourg and Poole, and Le Havre and Portsmouth, representing a 50 per cent increase on its current schedule.Christophe Mathieu, Brittany Ferries chief executive, said: “Our priority is to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and to create additional capacity.“By increasing the number of rotations on routes like Le Havre — Portsmouth we will be able to meet the Department for Transport’s Brexit requirement.“We will also work hard to minimise impact on existing Brittany Ferries freight customers and passengers, although there may be some changes to some sailing times, for which we apologise in advance.”A spokesman for the DfT said: “This significant extra capacity is a small but important element of the Department for Transport’s no-deal Brexit planning.“While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached successfully, the department is helping ensure the rest of Government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios, including a particular focus on a potential no-deal and to mitigate the impact of any Brexit outcome on all transport modes.”A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: “It is complete madness to see the Government recklessly handing over £100 million on preparing British ports for a no-deal scenario.“The Government has the power to stop no-deal at any time but instead is spending millions on last-minute contracts.”Eloise Todd, leader of the Best for Britain campaign for a second EU referendum, said: “The truth is no-deal is not inevitable. This Government has a real choice to make for our country and it does not have to toy with a cliff-edge Brexit.“The only way forward for the country right now is to put the decision back to the people and put the public at the heart of the decision over our future. People have been locked out of the Brexit process since the 2016 vote — it’s time to bring them back in and let them decide our future.”– PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Many who capture these images are servicemen and women first and photographers second, deploying with their rifle as well as their camera, taking the same risks as others but also giving the public a unique, candid view of the realities of conflict.

Their reappearance in Italy has come a little earlier than we expected.“We hope that in the spring they might form a breeding population. It’s very good news,” said Mr Molinari.By felling trees with their sharp teeth and damming streams, beavers create ponds which benefit many other species, from amphibians and birds to fish and aquatic insects.Their impact on the environment is being felt in Scotland, where beavers have been reintroduced after the species was driven to extinction in Britain in the 16th century.It is not just beavers that are on the rebound in northern Italy.A Eurasian beaver gnawing away at a treeThe golden jackal, an elusive animal normally found in the Balkans, the Middle East and parts of Asia, has also begun to spread into Italy.After decades of being hunted, trapped and poisoned, the jackal - Canis aureus - has reestablished healthy populations in Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia and is now moving steadily west.The species has been spotted in the Italian regions of Veneto, Lombardy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-South Tyrol, where its prey includes roe deer.Jackals are now believed to have crossed the Po River in northern Italy and to be slowly spreading south.A camera trap captured this image of a golden jackal at nightExperts say the expansion of the species is due to official protection as well as by the historic persecution in many areas of wolves, leaving an ecological vacuum that jackals have exploited.“It appears that people have triggered the expansion of golden jackals by almost eradicating the wolf,” according to the European Wilderness Society. “Golden jackals tend to avoid wolf territories because of competition.”Experts say the reappearance of beavers and golden jackals shows that the mountains and forests of the border region between Austria, Slovenia and Italy act are an important corridor for wildlife.“We’re seeing lots of animals returning, including brown bears, wolves, lynx and otters,” said Mr Molinari, a member of the Italian Lynx Project, which aims to restore the lynx to its former range and to mitigate conflicts with farmers.Please review our commenting policyMilly Dowler killer \u0026#39belonged to paedophile gang who escaped justice\u0026#39Rose West launches new bid for release as friends say she doesn\u0026#39t want to die in prisonComment: The migrant crisis demands that Sajid Javid stands up to the EU and FranceSouth Korea\u0026#39s Kim Jong-un fan clubs prepare welcome as North Korean leader vows visit to SeoulWhy 2018 was the year that theatre ripped up the rulebookEsther Rantzen reveals her children staged an \u0026#39intervention\u0026#39 to tell her to work less and spend more time with her grandchildrenPutin says Moscow is open for dialogue with the US in New Year letter to TrumpMorocco arrests Swiss national in connection with killing of ScandinaviansColombia investigates possible plot to assassinate presidentBritain to become \u0026#39true global player\u0026#39 post-Brexit with military bases in South East Asia and Caribbean, says Defence Secretary How gangs are charging £3,000 to smuggle migrants across the Channel - before dumping them halfwayHow legal cannabis has swept across the US - transforming the economy and putting states at odds with the federal governmentJean Claude-Juncker says the majority of British MPs \u0026#39deeply distrust\u0026#39 Theresa May over BrexitComment: Drones are just the tip of the power that hackers can wield in our modern worldTop news stories of 2018: A year of marriage, poison and BrexitComment: Brexit and beyond - my political predictions for 2019   Comment: Forget the false religion of Dry January and embrace Stoicism insteadFemale theologians publish \u0026#39women\u0026#39s bible\u0026#39 to counter claims the Holy Book is sexist in the age of #MeTooEnglish counties urged to fly their flags to \u0026#39boost community pride and tourism\u0026#39Move over Leonardo - the quest to rescue from obscurity Florence\u0026#39s women artists We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/18/TELEMMGLPICT000166718840_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrS8Z1b0ZQjNoViJZ3HnGQ3wHgzae649ojkLyszvdRnw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"colombia investigates possible plot assassinate president","story":"Ivan Duque has been leading a diplomatic effort in Latin America to isolate Venezuela\u0026#39s socialist governmentColombian authorities are investigating a possible plot involving Venezuelans to assassinate President Ivan Duque, a top official said Saturday night.Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes said Colombia\u0027s intelligence services had been hearing chatter about alleged plans to kill the conservative Duque. He said the arrest in recent days of three Venezuelans in possession of assault weapons had heightened authorities\u0027 concern.With immense concern and the utmost condemnation, I want to inform the international community that, in effect, for the past several months intelligence investigations have been taking place about possible attacks on the president\u0027s life, Holmes said in a video posted on Twitter that interrupted the normally end-of-year news lull in the South American nation.Blu Radio reported that the Venezuelans arrested in the northern Caribbean cities of Valledupar and Barranquilla this month had in their possession an assault rifle with a telescopic scope as well as a 9-mm mini-Uzi, ammunition and stun grenade.Citing sources it didn\u0027t identify, Blu said any alleged plot would have likely had the support of armed Colombian leftist rebels or drug-trafficking organizations and would have been timed to coincide with the start of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u0027s second term next month.Holmes\u0027 90-second video did not cite any evidence and carefully avoided saying whether authorities had verified the existence of any conspiracy.There was no immediate reaction from Venezuela\u0027s government.Holmes appealed to Colombians to share any information that they have that could affect the president\u0027s safety. He also thanked the cooperation of unidentified foreign intelligence agencies for helping protect Duque.Duque, who took office in August, has been leading a diplomatic effort in Latin America to isolate Venezuela\u0027s socialist government as Maduro looks to cement his hold on power amid a devastating economic crisis that has seen millions of Venezuelans flee to escape widespread food shortages and hyperinflation.Colombia, the U.S. and several other foreign governments say Maduro\u0027s election victory in May amid an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging was illegitimate and are urging the embattled leader to call new elections in which all of his opponents, several of whom have been exiled or banned from holding office, be allowed to run.Maduro in recent weeks has been ratcheting up his rhetoric against Colombia, accusing his neighbor of plotting with the U.S. to violently oust him from power. Please review our commenting policyMilly Dowler killer \u0026#39belonged to paedophile gang who escaped justice\u0026#39Rose West launches new bid for release as friends say she doesn\u0026#39t want to die in prisonComment: The migrant crisis demands that Sajid Javid stands up to the EU and FranceSouth Korea\u0026#39s Kim Jong-un fan clubs prepare welcome as North Korean leader vows visit to SeoulWhy 2018 was the year that theatre ripped up the rulebookEsther Rantzen reveals her children staged an \u0026#39intervention\u0026#39 to tell her to work less and spend more time with her grandchildrenPutin says Moscow is open for dialogue with the US in New Year letter to TrumpBeavers are back in Italy after an absence of nearly 500 years as big mammals rebound in EuropeMorocco arrests Swiss national in connection with killing of ScandinaviansBritain to become \u0026#39true global player\u0026#39 post-Brexit with military bases in South East Asia and Caribbean, says Defence Secretary How gangs are charging £3,000 to smuggle migrants across the Channel - before dumping them halfwayHow legal cannabis has swept across the US - transforming the economy and putting states at odds with the federal governmentJean Claude-Juncker says the majority of British MPs \u0026#39deeply distrust\u0026#39 Theresa May over BrexitComment: Drones are just the tip of the power that hackers can wield in our modern worldTop news stories of 2018: A year of marriage, poison and BrexitComment: Brexit and beyond - my political predictions for 2019   Comment: Forget the false religion of Dry January and embrace Stoicism insteadFemale theologians publish \u0026#39women\u0026#39s bible\u0026#39 to counter claims the Holy Book is sexist in the age of #MeTooEnglish counties urged to fly their flags to \u0026#39boost community pride and tourism\u0026#39Move over Leonardo - the quest to rescue from obscurity Florence\u0026#39s women artists We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"forget false religion dry january embrace stoicism instead","story":"Dry January: boring, self-indulgent, and unrealisticAt this time of year, the false religion of excess is often exchanged for the equally false religion of abstention.

In “Playtest”, starring Wyatt Russell, the front cover of\u0026nbspEdge\u0026nbspmagazine indicates that there is a review of “Bandersnatch”\u0026nbspinside. In the scene, Sonja uses the magazine to encourage Cooper to take a mysterious job with video game company SaitoGemu.\u0026nbspThe episode opens with Stefan at home with his father, a widow, offering him a choice of breakfast cereal (the first decision the user is faced with). From there, he travels to an interview with a\u0026nbspgames company so he can pitch his idea for a game adaptation of the multiple choice novel, Bandersnatch, which was written by a man who descended into madness as he completed it.\u0026nbspAt the office, he is introduced to Colin Ritman\u0026nbsp(Coulter), Stefan\u0027s hero, and a man with whom you can have either a lot or barely any interaction with, depending on the choices you make. Throughout the film there are loops that guide you back to the correct narrative if you stray too far, such as when Stefan is asked whether he wants to work in the office or at home, on his own. The home option is preferred as it leads to Stefan\u0027s own slow descent into madness as he becomes obsessed with completing Bandersnatch.As he works, he becomes more and more irritated by interruptions from his father, and trips to his therapist. You can learn during therapy\u0026nbsp(as we did in this version of the story) that his mother died in a train crash after Stefan caused her to miss an earlier train – an event that likely triggered\u0026nbsphis current mental health issues.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

Bandersnatch is released to rave reviews, as a current-day news report informs us that Stefan was later arrested and charged with his father\u0027s murder.\u0026nbspThis writer was slightly sceptical at how Netflix is managing to get viewers to watch the episode countless times to see the various endings... meaning mega streams for them. At first the interactions are fun, but the constant interruptions to the story as you\u0027re asked to make yet another decision on Stefan\u0027s behalf can become\u0026nbspquite wearisome, and if anything it pulls you out of the story rather than allowing\u0026nbspyou to become engrossed in it.Netflix says of the new interactive film: “There are choices to be made, challenges to overcome, dangers to encounter and, as always in life (and Black Mirror), consequences to be had. Choosing wisely could lead to triumph while taking the wrong path could end in disaster – but who’s to say what’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, anyway? And fret not because once one experience comes to a close, you can – and should! – go back and make a new choice, alter the path of your story and maybe even change its outcome.”The liveblog has now closed.\u0026nbspInteractive film was released on Netflix today (Friday 28 December)Bandersnatch\u0026nbspoffers viewers the chance to decide the fate of its lead character, computer game creator\u0026nbspStefanAudience members can choose anything from the song he decides to listen to, to whether he attends a therapy sessionNetflix also confirmed that there are “five main endings with multiple variants of each”... although fans could uncover more depending on the choices they make, allowing for a little extra mystery.\u0026nbspRead our review of\u0026nbspBandersnatch,\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It\u0027s also unclear — though presumable — that the number reflects accounts that have accessed the film globally. (Netflix is currently available in more than 190 countries.)“Exactly how Netflix qualifies what counts as a viewing is another question. Does the figure account for those who accidentally play the film from an auto-play option? Does it log “viewers” who only watch a few seconds or the entire film?“And is there any way to say what portion of that audience would make the effort of going to a theatre and buying a ticket to Bird Box?

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own.

Bird Box doesn’t take us anywhere we haven’t already been in these other movies.\u0026nbsp“The plotting is sometimes very cumbersome. As the protagonists stumble through forests using fishing line to guide them, you begin to wish they would take off their blindfolds and simply look where they are going. The screenplay never really explains why the evil force (whatever it might be) causes some of those who stare at it to kill themselves while turning others into homicidal psychotics.” also gave the film two stars, criticising it for “clunky punchlines” and its slow-moving pace, along with a cast that feels “as curated as a box of doughnuts”.\u0026nbsp“Heisserer’s script endeavours to give Bullock a rich psychological backstory — something to do with her reluctance to accept motherhood and the redemption she experiences in accepting that role — and the wonderfully self-reliant actress plays the arc earnestly enough,” Variety said. “But there’s no getting around that this is a monster movie without a monster.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels. But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPredicting bitcoin\u0027s fortunes in 2019 has therefore ided analysts, with forecasts from high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry ranging from a complete capitulation, to a 10-fold increase from today\u0027s price of $3,650.The most radical predictions come from bitcoin cash founder Calvin Ayre and Fundstrat\u0026nbspco-founder Thomas Lee.

Due to the different paths the story can take, the film can last between 40 to 90 minutes.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch, review – Intriguing but imperfect How Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is an experiment on usWhat happened when we watched the Black Mirror film, BandersnatchIf you don’t have the time (or patience) to watch the film multiple times, however, you can pick the option that appears as the credits begin to roll, to loop back to a crucial moment in the story and change your choices, to see if they cause a different ending.This means that you can see most of the possible variants without having to start from the very beginning.\u0026nbspThese are the endings fans have discovered so far:1) The very quick one,\u0026nbspwhere the user accepts an offer to join Thakur\u0027s team and develop his video game in the office, instead of refusing. Bandersnatch\u0026nbspthen flashes to an ending in which a rushed version of his game gets zero stars from a critic, as Stefan decides to “try again” — inviting the viewer to go back and make him develop the game on his own.\u0026nbsp2) In another, Stefan\u0027s widower father comes into his room after weeks of Stefan working alone on the game. You can either force Stefan to shout at his dad or make him throw\u0026nbsphis tea\u0026nbspover his computer. Destroying Stefan’s computer ends the story. In a similar moment, when Stefan becomes frustrated with the game\u0027s progress you can either make him destroy his computer or bang his fist on the desk. Destroying the computer ends the game, again.3) The balcony ending happens when Stefan is taken to see Dr Haynes by his father, where he spots Colin walking down the street. If Stefan follows Colin instead of attending therapy, the pair embark on a night of drugs and philosophy, which then leads to a moment where Colin claims it doesn\u0027t matter if one of them jumps from his balcony.\u0026nbspThe viewer is told to either force Stefan to jump,\u0026nbspor make him tell Colin to do it. The former choice ends the story with Stefan’s suicide, and his game is finished “abruptly” without him, to negative reviews.4) Bandersnatch pushes the story forward so that Stefan has to visit Dr Haynes for a session and get a prescription for pills. If you do choose to make Stefan see Dr\u0026nbspHaynes instead of following Colin, she’ll give him the pills and you’ll have to decide whether he should flush them or take them.\u0026nbspOnce you make Stefan take his medication, the story jumps to Christmas, where Stefan has been taking his pills for months. His game is released, but the critic only gives it two-and-a-half stars and criticises it for feeling as though it were made on\u0026nbsp“autopilot”.5) In\u0026nbspthe most meta ending of the film, Stefan demands to know the truth: Who is controlling him? If you decide to tell him that his life is actually\u0026nbspentertainment on “a streaming platform from the early 21st century” (Netflix), he returns to\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspHaynes’s office to tell her about it.\u0026nbspThe doctor points out that if Stefan’s story was true, surely this scenario of him at a therapist\u0027s office would be too boring for such an advanced form of entertainment. Things then take a bizarre turn as she leaps out of her chair and challenges him to a brawl, complete with swords.\u0026nbspYou have to decide whether Stefan should fight her or flee by jumping through a window, and if you choose the latter, the fourth wall breaks completely, revealing Stefan is\u0026nbspactually an actor standing on the Black Mirror set. A\u0026nbspdirector then storms over to tell him that he’s “not scripted to jump out, it’s the fight scene now.. The story ends after the actor asserts that his real name is Stefan, marking his final break with reality, and the production team calls a medic.6) There are several endings where\u0026nbspStefan goes to prison\u0026nbspfor murdering his father. (Depending on the route, he also ends\u0026nbspup killing Thakur, Colin, or Colin’s wife, Kitty) In all these versions of the story, you\u0027re essentially forced to make Stefan kill his father if you didn’t choose to already.\u0026nbspThen you have to decide between burying or chopping up his body. All the ways of burying the body lead to Stefan in jail and Bandersnatch getting trashed by the critic, if it gets released at all.7) Arguably the most sinister ending is when you make Stefan chop up his dead father\u0027s body, and he finally gets time to finish the game,\u0026nbspwhich gets five stars from the critic when it’s released — although the game is\u0026nbsppulled from sale after Stefan gets caught and sent to jail. From there, Bandersnatch flashes forward to the present day, where Colin\u0027s daughter Pearl is shown to be working on an archive version of the game for a new generation. When she encounters the\u0026nbspsame bugs that Stefan did, the old question returns: should she throw tea\u0026nbspher computer, or destroy it?8) A few people worked out that “TOY” is the password that Stefan needs to recover his favourite stuffed bunny from his father’s safe, he then travels back to that moment in his past and places it under his childhood bed. His mother still misses her train while the young Stefan looks for his toy, but this time\u0026nbspthe viewer is given more than one choice when she asks if he wants to go with her. If Stefan says “yes,” he dies in the train crash with his mum, after which the teenage Stefan is shown suddenly dying in his therapist\u0027s office.One fan went the extra mile and made a graph of all the alternatives in the same style as the game map itself:Reviews for the new film have been mixed, but mostly positive.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsppraised it for being “innovative” with the interactive elements, adding:\u0026nbsp”What saves the film from pure gimmickry is the way in which its mechanism is bound up with the plot.Created with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He would ring, to tell me what the weather was like over there, while I was suffering, in grey, wet, chilly London. Or how, he was enjoying some fine, French wine he’d taken specially while sitting with his feet dangling in the warm, balmy sea.Not any more. So far, the phone has lain silent. Although after reading this, he might ring again, as he did in the summer, because I wrote something he did not agree with. Once again, I was treated to a volley of abuse, much of it too crude to repeat here.It’s been a recurring theme of 2018, the PR demise of Sir Philip Green or “PG” as he is known throughout the sector and City. When the year began, he’d still not recovered from the fallout over the sale of BHS to someone who did not have the financial muscle to take on a business of that size, and Green’s subsequent refusal to plug the company’s pension deficit. He did cough up, eventually, and only after much protest.Then, came Oliver Shah’s excellent biography, Damaged Goods: the Inside Story of Sir Philip Green, the Collapse of BHS and the Death of the High Street. It painted a colourful picture of Green, and his swaggering, bruising manner.That was followed by the revelation that Green had gagged former employees from detailing his sexual and racial harassment – claims that he vehemently denies.Finally, Green’s Arcadia group was exposed to what was a horrid shopping season. It certainly was an annus horribilis for him, reputation-wise, not that he would ever reach for a polite Latin phrase as the Queen once famously did – Green would opt for a more Anglo-Saxon wording.Sir Philip Green’s and Simon Cowell business partnership Spare a thought for poor old billionaire Philip GreenSir Philip Green’s net worth and retail empireWhen he looks back on where it all went wrong – to apply some context he remains incredibly wealthy, is still a high street force, retains his knighthood, and became a grandfather, but there’s no doubt he’s suffered – he only has himself to blame.That sense of self, of believing entirely in his own gifts, has propelled him to great heights. He’s a natural, intuitive, aggressive deal-maker, blessed with an uncanny propensity for mental arithmetic. Whether he’s a genius at the longer game of retailing is a moot point. Certainly, he knew how to build an empire, and to keep it buoyant – for a while. But did he read the long-term runes, and foresee the advent of online shopping, and did he exhibit the same fleetness of foot as some of his competitors?Green is not someone who responds constructively to criticism. If the media and politicians attack his convoluted financial arrangements that see the business vested in the name of his wife who lives in Monaco as a way of avoiding tax, he will roar his defiance.A more publicly empathetic person, one who cares deeply about how they’re perceived, who can see that the tax line will dog him constantly and be wheeled out as a weapon to beat him with, might end the arrangement and swallow the resulting hefty bill. But they would regard it as a price worth paying, for better treatment by the press and parliament, for a favourable public standing.Not Green. Similarly, from the off, as soon as the BHS affair blew up, he could have made a payment to cover the pension gap into an escrow account, and leave the lawyers to sort out the fine detail. But he chose not to.He complained that his opponents liked to focus on his extravagant, bling lifestyle. Meanwhile, he would order another superyacht, so that he owned not one, but two. His reasoning was that his spending was none of their concern, that what he did with his money was up to him. He would describe his lavish parties as private, but then call journalists to invite them to listen, down the line, as George Michael did a sound-check.He’s never fully appreciated that he is also a public figure, a modern celebrity, who courted publicity for himself and for his fashion products, who liked to be photographed surrounded by supermodels. In many town centres, his outlets play a vital role, as anchor tenants, central to the wellbeing of the shopping districts and accompanying communities. Green is a major employer, responsible for several tens of thousands of jobs. He cannot have it both ways.As with many kings, his world is also that of a court. His advisers are courtiers, there, possibly, to please not help, to say “can” rather than “can’t”, and “yes” not “no”. It’s questionable, whether his actions and the blows to his image are the result of receiving bad advice, or disregarding good advice and preferring to do his own thing. Whatever the answer, he became badly unstuck in 2018. For that, he was my Man of the Year, but for all the wrong reasons.For anyone looking at how not to manage communications, how to make a bad public relations situation worse, Green’s last 12 months is a textbook tour de force.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/17/instagram.jpg","title":"instagram update latest scrolling why reverse old version guide swipe","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The message that pops up when the update arrives offers some clue about why this happened: Stories.Instagram update completely changes how users scroll through feedInstagram notes that the feature is more similar to the Stories tool that rolled out in 2016, allowing people to post disappearing photos and videos that could be clicked through in exactly the same way. It even tells people that they can use the same feed in just the same way.Since 2016, Stories has become probably the most quickly growing kind of media ever to be launched: not just on Instagram but everywhere on the web, the side-swiping, clicky way of getting through an app has spread itself across the entire internet. Instagram Stories is now twice as big as rival Snapchat, and makes up a major part of the way people use the app.Presumably excited by the vast popularity of those Stories, Instagram has decided to make everything else work that way, too.It is worth noting that even as Stories have gone from strength to strength, and Instagram has continued to grow, the company\u0027s founders also recently left the company. That was because of disputes with owners Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the direction of the company, according to a report in Bloomberg\u0026nbsp– and it may be that features such as these were the cause of those disagreements.It seems to be on its way to everybody, though that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll definitely have got it yet. Force quitting the app and scrolling around a little appears to make the new feature most likely to arrive.Usually, new Instagram features – especially ones like this, which bring dramatic changes – are rolled out slowly, to a small group of people first and then gradually to everybody else. But this appears to have come in one fell swoop, on Thursday afternoon UK time.They hate it. Almost everybody seems to absolutely despise the update.Searching for the word Instagram on Twitter brings a whole host of posts, many including explicit language unfit for this website.Give me back my timeline, one illustrative but relatively family-friendly post reads.\u0026nbspThis update SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: no. Instagram isn\u0027t giving its users the ability to use the old format, even temporarily: once the update has arrived, it has arrived forever, by the looks of things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Instagram often staggers such updates gradually.It has been greeted with near-unanimous outrage by the millions of users who have presumably just received it.What the hell is this @instagram?! wrote on.

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/gettyimages-669005400.jpg","title":"lady gaga enigma las vegas residency reviews setlist tickets","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Three if I’m lucky!’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialLady Gaga’s Las Vegas residency is the role she was born to playA history of Las Vegas residencies, from Liberace to Lady GagaKendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Thom Yorke up for Best Original Song“There’s a short encore to properly conclude the show once Enigma departs. In an oversized march shirt that has her Bowie-inspired “Poker Face” lightning bolt cutting through a silhouette of her body, she sings one last song: “Shallow,” the runaway hit from A Star Is Born.\u0026nbsp“The moment is a balm, and its one that makes sure the show’s time machine takes us right back to the present, reminding us how far she’s come and the many lives she’s lived after taking us on a tour of her own musical history. She performs ‘Shallow’ as Ally Maine does towards the end of the film after becoming a full-fledged pop idol.”The review concludes: “For a show that at first seemed like an excuse to remind us what Gaga is best at, it ended up becoming a show that confirms and begins her legacy.”“Enigma\u0026nbspis a generous show, by Vegas pop standards, not just by exceeding the standard get-‘em-out-onto-the-slot-machines set length, but because Gaga also happens to do almost two hours more of actual singing than some of her counterparts on the Strip,” Variety said. “Watching Gaga do what she does best — even better than act, still — is all the story or connecting thread a show needs. She and ‘Born This Way’ were both born to be in Vegas, and to raise the bar for superstar residencies just a little bit higher.”Entertainment Weekly said: “Enigma is Gaga’s way of sharing an epiphany that we can only assume she’s recently experienced and strove to manifest creatively in the way that best suits her.\u0026nbsp“At some point, Gaga lost who she was — whether by her own fault, or the machine around her, is only for her to say — but Enigma, in as much as we need from it, serves as her way of affirming that she’s never been more secure in who she is, and that the most atypical parts of Lady Gaga are just as present and valid as the parts we perhaps have told her we’d have an easier time accepting.”Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.For Billboard, the outfits during the show were a big draw: “With her longtime fashion collaborator Nicola Formichetti and her sister Natali Germanotta joining forces, the duo spawned a number of creative looks —ranging from florescent and leather to a body suit with flashing LED lights and a nude-colored unitard— for Gaga, the dancers and her band that would have made David Bowie proud.”\u0026nbspThe EW review added: “As over-the-top as the show was, it was the more sombre\u0026nbspmoments that stood out and gave insight to her separate Vegas show titled “Lady Gaga Jazz \u0026amp Piano,” which will feature stripped down versions of Gaga’s hits.”In a feature for\u0026nbspThe Independent, Helen\u0026nbspBrown observed how the Las Vegas residency is the role Gaga was “born to play”.“Those out of the Sin City loop may think it odd for a star on such a trajectory to sign up for Vegas,” she said.\u0026nbsp”For decades, the Nevada city has been the place where America put pop singers out to pasture. But the mood has been shifting since Britney Spears began drawing a younger, hipper crowd with her 2013-2017 Piece of Me show, which earned the MGM Park casino hotel around $135m (£107m) in ticket sales alone. While that show was something of a comeback – albeit for a relatively young performer – Bruno Mars signed up for his 2016 residency at the peak of his commercial and critical success and made 24K showbiz magic of it.“Gaga has reportedly been given $100 million reasons to deliver a two-year residency (also at the MGM Park). She’s an even better fit for Vegas than Spears or Mars: she is capable of both visually excessive pop and elegant old-school jazz.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/28/01/michael-palin-getty.jpg","title":"new year honours 2019 michael palin knight culture full list","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece.

There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6.

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

It is certainly shaping up to be a historic start to the new year for MPs returning to the chamber.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .If the jet was flying north then possible locations could stretch as fast as the border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Thailand.The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak originally asked the Kazakhstan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a search operation in the country but this quickly got sidelined as the rescue efforts focused on the Indian Ocean.A group of aviation experts assembled for the Australian TV programme  Minutes, broadcast in May .They claimed they may have solved the aviation mystery.They all agreed that Shah deliberately ditched the plane in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.Former Australia Transport Safety Bureau head Martin Dolan added: This was planned, this was deliberate, and it was done over an extended period of time.Simon Hardy, a pilot and instructor, discovered the captain made an unexplained and strange turn to fly over his hometown of Penang.He also claimed Shah dodged Malaysian and Thai military radar by skirting along their borders.But aviation expert has rubbished claims made in the documentary that the pilot of doomed flight MH gently landed the plane in the Indian ocean.Christine Negroni said analysis of pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March  — meaning the plane was out of control when it hit the water.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000070087372.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"queens brithday honours 2018 kenny dalglish knighted","story":"Dalglish and his we Marina have raised millions of pounds for cancer treatment and has also been a tireless campaigner for justice for the families of the  killed in the Hillsborough disaster.The -year-old Glaswegian was manager of Liverpool at the time of the tragedy - and is one of just two British managers to win the Premier League as boss of Blackburn in .Last night he said he was “hugely proud to have accepted the accolade” - in recognition for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool.And he joked that he thought the letter informing him of the knighthood had been from the taxman.Sir Kenny said: “We only set out to do the best we possibly could, even through all the other stuff - the charity or Hillsborough, it was to help people because somebody helped us.”Defoe dedicated his OBE to brave cancer tot Bradley Lowery, who he became friends with in the final months of his tragically short le.The Bournemouth striker said he was “truly honoured and humbled” to receive the award - given in recognition for his charitable work through the Jermain Defoe Foundation, which was set up to raise money for underprivileged children in the Caribbean and the UK.Defoe said he felt “mixed emotions” over the award, coming nearly a year after Bradley’s death aged .He said he wanted to “scream with joy” when his mum rang him up while he was on holiday to tell him about the OBE.But the footballer - speaking alongside his mother, added: “There’s been a lot of tears, it’s been tough.

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, without our cash, the EU now realises there will be a massive black hole in their coffers.EU chiefs mistakenly thought they had us over a barrel and could use their leverage to get whatever they wanted.But they are now waking up to the fact that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is unlikely to get the nod and, with no deal legally our default position, a clean break looms.The refusal to give our PM any concessions does not look so wise now.The Sun has long questionedthe EU would ever prioritise their economies and citizens’ jobs over a zealous desire to punish Britain for leaving.Perhaps Mr Oettinger’s comments suggest that reality is finally dawning.IT is shocking that Britain has just TWO boats to police , miles of shoreline.Organised gangs are taking advantage of our easily penetrable coast to traffick desperate people who will risk their lives in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to get here.As many as  people have tried to cross over from France in just two months.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mobile number sending the messages was an Irish number.“I just find it astonishing, that from the right beginning, they only believed her, to be dead. They never went ­looking for her.”Computer programmer Belling was lted as he tried to fly home from Rome’s Ciampino Airport with their kids after the cruise on February , .He was released last April and is now living back in Clarehall, Dublin, with his children and his Chinese mother-in-law while the probe continues in Italy.She has defended him as “a very good person”, telling an Italian TV show: “I don’t think he could hurt my daughter.”Solicitor Conti said the case is due to go to trial in March and claims ­evidence obtained by Belling’s nephew should be enough to exonerate him.He told the Irish Sun: “An invoice was sent to us in the post by Daniel’s nephew. It showed her credit card had been used to pay the motorway close to Dublin after Daniel was arrested.”Conti said the M toll was paid on March , . He continued: “While Mr Belling was in prison, I was given back his house keys. Daniel’s nephew went to the family home and then called me.“As he found out that he could not open the house with those keys, I advised him to call the police and check with them,there had been any kind of measures.Nothing had been carried out or was done.“Together with the police, Daniel’s nephew opened the door. The house was in order. No one had broken in.“It was clear, that someone entered the house and changed the locks. The we had a set of keys. According to her husband, she was the only one to have copy of the keys. She entered the house and then changed the lock.“The nephew, once he managed to enter the house, changed the locks, but he did it officially in this case.“Daniel, now lives in the same family home, close to the airport, with his two children and his mother-in-law.He added: “If she was in doubt he had killed her daughter, she would have nothing to do with him.”Conti said it was baffling cops had spoken to “- witnesses” who “did not notice anything unusual” — and told how officers failed in their probe.He said: “Mr Belling’s cabin was not seized. Therefore, Italian forensic police got onboard the ship seven days after the ship had docked at port as the final destination, to find the Bellings’ cabin had been reassigned to another couple.“The police took some photos from Belling’s balcony.

George Reginald Oliver Molyneux Herbert is one of  aristocrats competing in a hereditary peer by-election in the House of Lords. Only hereditary peers can stand in the bizarre poll, a hangover from attempts to reform the Lords, and only members of the House of Lords can vote. The winner will be able to shape laws and claim pound a day until they die or retire - a situation previously branded a mockery of our democracy. The -year-old th Earl of Carnarvon lives with his countess we in Highclere Castle on a ,-acre estate in Hampshire. The lavish house with a state dining room, library and smoking room was used as the home of the Crawley family in ITVs fictional period drama.   His ancestor the rd Earl remodelled the sprawling manor, whose origins date to AD, in the s into the stately home that is now famous around the world. And the th Earl practiced digging in its grounds before joining forces with Howard Carter to discover the tomb of Tutankhamun in Egypt. Tours of the estate cost pound a head while a Valentines Day tour with afternoon tea costs pound for a couple. In a manesto to fellow peers, the th Earl said owning his home has given him experience of small business, farming, tourism and countryside heritage matters that would help him in the House of Lords.  He added the residences renown gives him an international outlook to the world through Highcleres presence online. He also wrote he could bring experience from investing and working in software and technology, and promised to take part in committees and debates. The election is a hangover from Tony Blairs bid to modernise the House of Lords. Hereditary peers were mostly cast out in  but  remained as a compromise. That means when one dies or retires, remaining hereditary peers get first refusal on the seat, and only members of the House of Lords can vote. The latest election is being held to replace Tory Lord Skelmersdale, an Old Etonian who sat in the Lords for  years before his death in October.

Rival candidates include -year-old Lord Biddulph, whose entire manesto is the words always happy to serve, and Viscount Mountgarret, whose family own , acres of land devoted to game hunting in North Yorkshire. Other candidates include retired Navy commander the Earl of Effingham and state secondary school teacher Lord Hampton. Peers will be invited to cast their ballot in the opulent Queens robing room in the House of Lords on January . They can also vote by post.

The top Tory was forced to cut short his Christmas holiday in South Africa after  desperate people including children were intercepted trying to cross the Strait of Dover since Christmas Day. On Friday Mr Javid declared the situation a major incident and appointed a Gold Commander amid warnings it was a matter of time until a mass death. But he reportedly only decided yesterday to abandon a holiday with his family in a lodge that costs pound-per-person-per-night,you share a room. The Sunday Times reported he stayed in Dulini Lodge in the Kruger National Park, a .million-acre wilderness home to lions, leopards, rhinos and elephants. Guests at the riverside lodge are promised a symphony of birdsong in private plunge pools, three-hour safari drives and sundown cocktails overlooking the park. It is believed Mr Javid had been away for just four days when he took the decision to cut short his break - and had not yet had the chance to go on safari.  A source close to the Home Secretary would not confirm where he had stayed but insisted he had not been on safari. Mr Javids actions prompted demands for him to get a grip as the issue exploded into a political row. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson added to the pressure on his Cabinet colleague, saying the armed forces were ready to help. We have not had any requests as yet butthe Home Office is in need of armed forces support then our Navy, Air Force and Army stand ready to assist,” he told the Sunday . Some pundits branded Mr Williamsons intervention a proxy battle for the Tory leadership after Theresa May steps down before the next election in . And critics have attacked the scale of the response to  migrants crossing the Channel - compared to the , children in the UK in temporary accommodation over Christmas. Labour MP Karen Lee added: Given the numbers of Grenfell survivors left homeless under hiswatch, many still not permanently rehoused, the news that Sajid Javid is charging home to tackle the migrant crisis is worrying. These people are vulnerable refugees.  Six men were apprehended by Border Force officials at .am today on a beach in Kingsdown, Kent - bringing the estimated number of people detained trying to cross the Channel to  since Christmas Day. The six men, all Iranian nationals, have been given a medical assessment and have been transferred to immigration officials for processing. Mr Javid claimed he was keeping the number of Border Force vessels in the Channel under close review, but claimed there was no one easy answer. Home Office officials fear upping the number of cutters in the Channel - currently there is just one - could incentivise people smugglers to send more people on the dangerous journey. Conservative MP Rehman Chishti, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, blasted a lack of leadership to get a grip on this issue. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Tory MP for Dover and Deal Charlie Elphicke called for all five of the Border Forces Cutters to be deployed in the Channel as a powerful deterrent. Rejecting Mr Javids suggestion that increasing patrols would encourage more people to attempt the crossing, Mr Elphicke - who met Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes in Dover yesterday - said: You dont deter burglars by leaving your front door open.  He added: This cannot be done on the cheap with the half-hearted Dads Army-type set-up suggested by the Home Office in the past.” Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott blasted Mr Javid for failing to get a grip on criminal people smugglers. She said: He has still to explain exactly how the Government plans to handle these mass criminal operations in British waters. The Home Offices flawed strategy has been to focus on deterring refugees, thinking that the issues in the Mediterranean would never reach our shores. While the Tories wax lyrical about control of our borders and being tough on security, they cannot seem to get a grip on criminal smugglers operating on a few hundred miles of coastline, in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.

In what will be seen as a bid to burnish his credentials with Tory Brexiteers, Mr Hunt hailed the south-east Asian city state for plugging into the international economic grid on gaining its independence in . He also dismissed alternatives to Theresa Mays EU Withdrawal Agreement, denouncing the option of a second referendum as a dereliction of duty and warning that a no-deal Brexit could leave us poorer. Singapore has long been touted as a model for the UK after EU withdrawal by fervent Brexiteers such as former minister Owen Paterson, who last year wrote that Britain should adopt its low-tax, low-spend, low-regulation policies .  Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Hunt said Singapore had transformed itself from a tiny territory devoid of natural resources into the worlds eighth richest country. He added: While the circumstances of Britains departure from the EU are dferent, there could be few better instructions for us as we make our post-Brexit future. The Foreign Secretary, who backed Remain in , has emerged as a potential successor to Mrs May after shting his position to back Brexit. While acknowledging that the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, he urged fellow MPs to back it in next months crunch vote. All other options are fraught with danger and would create more problems than they solve, he warned.  A second referendum would ide the country again right at the moment when people need to come together, said Mr Hunt. And warning against the no-deal option favoured by some Leave-backing MPs, he said: No-one should be encouraging a move that could leave us poorer at the same time as gladdening the hearts of those who wish for a fractured Europe. Mr Hunts comments sparked a backlash from supporters of a second referendum, who warned the Singapore model would mean turning the UK into a bargain basement for business. Best for Britain spokesman Paul Butters said: The Foreign Secretary wants to turn this country into a low-tax haven for business. Nothing would help the elite out more, while stealing from the public purse vital funds for key services and damaging workers rights. Jeremy Hunt is frustrating the will of the people when he says things like this. No one voted for big business to rule over us.

The question is, “What happens now ” Mr Javid is cutting short his holiday. And it looks like he’s finally taking action, appointing a gold commander and talking about patrols being stepped up. These moves are necessary and to be welcomed. But he must also tackle the causes. Migration is a fact of le. There are lots of reasons people flee their homelands. Syria, for example, is a warzone and many Syrians have lost everything. In desperation, thousands have headed for Europe. And, because gangs are exploiting their panic and fear, one of the most dangerous parts of the journey is near the end. Organised criminals offer them a leline, but at an unbelievable cost: cut-price deals to allow migrants to put their children on boats.   This is not just a couple of conmen chancing their arms. These are cold, hard criminals who don’t caretheir “customers” live or die. One former coastguard officer says it is just a matter of time before there is a tragedy, and rescuers will soon be retrieving bodies rather than saving people. Mr Javid must act before that happens. That means beefing up our patrols and security. And it means smashing the evil networks exploiting vulnerable of people who are doing what we would all dowe lost shyeverything – trying to find a place of safety.

The kids and their parents – who pay pound, each – are herded on to inflatables and small vessels for the perilous -mile sailing from Calais to the Kent coast. Iraqi Kurdish gangsters use secret social media pages and passwords to drum up business. Then, “like travel agents”, they target refugees in ramshackle camps offering the “special half-price deals” for children. One refugee told us: “You have to pay mafia here to get on a boat to England.” But once in the UK many are picked up by “Mr Bigs” and forced into slavery. Last night Save the Children called our findings “sickening” and echoed a warning by French police that children’s lives are being put at risk. Home Secretary Sajid Javid cut short his holiday to deal with the migrant crisis, which he called a “major incident”. And Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes yesterday held an emergency meeting with the Border Force, Immigration Enforcement and the National Crime Agency in Dover. Our probe came as the toll of migrants plucked from the Channel by British authorities since Christmas Day reached . Many are professionals, business owners or from middle-class backgrounds in Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. They pay for the crossings after saving up, selling property or borrowing cash. Iranian Ahmad Lorpur, , has been living in a tent in Calais with his we and two children for four months while waiting for his chance to get to the UK. He told us: “You have to pay mafia to get on a boat. They are Iraqi-Kurds. “They call themselves ‘agents’, like travel agents. I have met one of them – a young Iraqi Kurd aged in his s. “He said he lives in England and that I needed to pay pound, each for me and my we to travel there. He said my children can go for half the price – pound,.” Standing with his kids Mariam, seven, and Benyamin, two, Ahmad added: “I have no money left now. It is all gone, butI had pound, I would pay it. “I paid ,to smugglers to get my family out of Iran and into Europe as we suffered persecution for being Christian. We managed to get here four months ago, but now we’re stuck. “It is no good for us here in Calais. My son is sick and we need help. “Everyone is waiting to get on boats to England. It is a big problem.”   An Iraqi-Kurdish refugee who is living at a camp  miles away, near Dunkirk, said desperate refugees contact smugglers through secret Facebook groups.The -year-old man, who lived in the north of England before being deported three years ago, asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. He said: “The names of the Facebook groups regularly change and it is not obvious what they are unless you know about them.“But after you’ve private messaged them, and they’re satisfied you’re not police, they send an agent to meet you in person. It’s still very cloak and dagger.“Once they’re completely happy, they negotiate a deal and give you a number to contact them on a messaging app like Telegram so it’s secure – as well as details of a bank account number for you or a family member to pay the money to. “I cannot risk giving you the details of the Facebook group becausethey found out I would be in a lot of danger. “They have knives and guns. I’m worried they could be watching now.” French officials say the number of detected illegal Channel crossings was  in  but has soared  per cent this year. But in Calais those determined to reach the UK are undeterred. While hundreds are putting their lives at risk on boats, others are paying pound, to stow away on lorries.  In the latest sea incidents, an inflatable containing four migrants was rescued off the Kent coast at around am on Friday.Six hours later another small boat was intercepted with eight people on board.That came after nine people, including three children, were intercepted on a beach in Sandgate, Kent, on Thursday.And more than  migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day.   Ingrid Parrot, of the French Maritime Police, said extra patrol vessels had been deployed to avert a tragedy. She added: “The figures are unprecedented and very disturbing. The risk is great.“There are  ships and  ferries crossing here every day. What’s more, the currents are strong and the winds almost permanent.” A senior French police source added: “Iraqi Kurds play a major part in the people smuggling rackets.“They are putting lives at risk while profiting from human misery. It is only a matter of time until lives are lost.” Two years ago, UK-based Iraqi Kurd gangster Twana Jamal,  – nicknamed The Godfather – was jailed for five years for a poundmillion-a-year cross-Channel people smuggling racket. And in September, two Albanians and five Brits from Kent were jailed for a total of  years after using small boats and a jet ski to smuggle people into the UK.

Last night, they were preparing to fly back with little Alice.But the youngsters homecoming is filled with heartache - because Ian and Linda have been forced to leave their eight-year-old grandson, Jack, behind.   The desperate pair, who continue to fight for custody of the two siblings, had been faced with the agonising choice to bring just Alice back - or neither child. This is because Jacks Chinese grandparents, who live in the northwestern city of Nanzhang, are refusing to give the boy up, The Mail on Sunday reports. On Boxing Day, as his gran Hu De Xiu packed a bag up for his little sister, the youngster reportedly wept and pleaded with her: Don’t let Alice go.We are overjoyed to bring Alice home but it breaks our hearts to leave Jack behind, Ian, now married to a second we, told the newspaper yesterday.Linda cried and asked me, How can we wrench them apart    He added that, in the end, he and his ex-we had to choose between bringing Alice home or walking away without either of their grandchildren. We could have lost them both for ever, he said.Ian and Lindas son Michael was killed in March  when he was kned by his estranged we, Weiwei Fu, in a jealous rage at his Shanghai apartment. The Next executive, who had met and married Fu after moving to China before they split up, had planned a university education for Alice and Jack.He had taken the youngsters around the world and gave them a western view, retired business project consultant Ian said in an interview earlier this year.  He added at the time said: “We lost our son and feel we can’t lose the children as well. They’re too precious... We can give them the le Michael wanted for them. We’d make sure they stayed in touch with their Chinese relatives.” Ian and Linda, who have spent more than pound, in their bid to get custody of Alice and Jack, spent time with their grandson in Nanzhang last week.They played with him at a hotel restaurant, as Fus parents looked on. Devastatingly, the two childrens Chinese relatives have allegedly told them that their parents are working abroad and that Michael abandoned them. But in reality, the father was stabbed to death by their mother, who is now serving le in prison after being locked up for murder this summer.   Ian, of Hartest, Suffolk, said earlier this year: That’s the lie they’ve been given but they’ll find out eventually. It’s terrible. He added that the kids were living in a one-bedroom flat containing five people, including their grandparents and cousin, in a small town.The granddad and Linda had previously enjoyed a close relationship with Alice and Jack. But after their sons murder, they were allegedly refused contact. The pair launched a heartbreaking battle for custody, which saw Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt raise the case on a visit to Beijing in July. Supporters also raised thousands to help the family. Ian and Linda ended up paying pound, in cash to Fus relatives.  They have reached an agreement that there will be weekly phone calls between Alice and Jack, as well as annual visits, the Mail on Sunday reports. Now, as they prepare to bring their granddaughter back to the UK, they are determined to keep up their fight until Jack can join them too.They say Alice is already missing her big brother.She has been amazingly brave but there have been moments when she has been in tears asking for her brother, Ian said.

Mum Jess Underwood had planned to spend the festive period at the Minehead resort with partner Stephen Grfiths, their five kids and another family of four. But she says their trip turned into a nightmare when two of their kids fell ill and then staff told them to leave. Jess said she and her family were forced to travel home to Penzance, in Cornwall, in the middle of the night and then had to find somewhere to eat on Christmas Day because they had no food in the house. Butlins policy section statesa guest has a contagious disease or illness they will be required to leave the resort, however a spokesman said the family will be offered a full refund.Jess told Somerset Live. When two of my children were sick in the night after we arrived I asked for clean sheets and some blankets because it was cold. They said someone would get back to me but no-one did.  I asked for some help again in the morning but again no-one called us back or gave us the clean sheets we needed. Two of my children and I had to sleep on the sofa because we could not change the sheets. They left us hanging all day the next day until .pm before they told us we had to leave immediately. They still charged us for a whole day before kicking us out even though theyve known since the night before that the children had been sick. No-one even asked after the children to see how they were. We were told we had one hour to get out then they had security guards escort us aswe had done something wrong. It was appaling. Butlins behaviour was utterly disgusting. Jess now vows her first trip to Butlins with children Summer, , Brooke, nine, Alyssa, six, Zailah, three, and Konnor, four, will be the last.  She added: We had taken a small Christmas tree and all the presents up there with us because we were supposed to spend Christmas at Butlins. We had to put everything back in the car in a rush and drive home to Penzance in the middle of the night and put everything back together at home in time for Christmas. We had to find somewhere to eat at the last minute because we had no food in the house as we were supposed to eat at Butlins and still paid the whole week for the catery. The children were so upset. They still remember it and talk about how we were kicked out of Butlins. What happened is outrageous. Jesss friend Roxanne and her family also left at the same time as they didnt want to be left on their own at the resort. The policy section of Butlins website confirms it is their right to evict anyone who falls sick on their premises. It reads: Should Butlins become aware, or have reasonable grounds for suspicion, that a guest has contracted a contagious disease or illness that has the potential to infect a large number of people quickly they and their party will be required to leave the resort. A Butlin’s spokesman told : “The first record we have of contact from the Underwood family was between . and am on December , when they informed us that some of their party were suffering sickness.“We advised the family that we would noty our housekeeping team. Our team made repeated attempts to call the family throughout the day to discuss next steps but were unable to make contact.“At approximately .pm on December , the family contacted us again to say three members of their party were now suffering with sickness.“Because we have to consider the welfare of all our guests and our team, where we believe any guests are suffering with an illness that could spread, we do regrettably ask them to leave.In this case, after the Underwoods contacted us again we spoke to them, assessed the situation and explained that we would need them to leave.We would only offer to quarantine guests in their room overnightthey informed us they had no means of travelling, and that wasn’t the case.“We certainly didn’t put any pressure on them to leave immediately, nor did we escort them off resort. It’s our understanding they eventually left early in the evening.“We refunded the Underwoods for the remainder of their break. Friends of the Underwoods, who were not unwell, also wanted to leave at the same time - we refunded them also. “Clearly this was not something we would wish for any guests at any time, but particularly on Christmas Eve.We hope the family members who were ill are now feeling better and we’re sorry that the delay between them contacting us in the morning and the decision to ask them to leave later that day exacerbated a very upsetting situation.With that in mind, we will be contacting the Underwoods so that we can express our apologies personally and arrange a full refund for them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dry january beckons here expert","story":"NewsDry January : Expert tips for a painless, alcohol-free start to the new yearBrits drank a staggering  units of alcohol a week during the festive season and in January one in ten of us will aiming for a month offShareCommentsByRachel Spencer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsInformation manager Alison Benson said she changed her le with Dry January\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe statics are quite shyfrightening andyou ever needed a reason to ease up on your booze intake, then now is the time – as Dry January is about to kick in.

The former England captain, , became an official member of the Royal Family in , when he married Zara Phillips - the Queens eldest granddaughter. Speaking about his very royal Christmas, dad-of-two Tindall revealed how the family have a surprisingly alternative Christmas day - dining on a cold buffet as opposed to roast turkey and all the trimmings. He described how the most of the festivities are played out on Christmas Eve - including the opening of presents and a black tie party in the night.  Speaking to Joe on the House of Rugby podcast, alongside fellow rugby star James Haskell, Tindall said: Christmas day is a little bit more quiet because it is a cold buffet - they give everyone the day off. Sheloves all the staff she has working for her so she gives as many the day off as she can. Their big day is on Christmas Eve - with a black tie shindig in the evening. Tindall, wearing a Christmas patterned suit, described how he likes to dress up in one of his garish festive outfits for the day - much to the Queens delights, who thinks dark colours are for sad times. He added: We open presents on Christmas Eve so I wore one of these and then just to give a little punch at breakfast, I came down in a dferent set up.  The Queen loves bright colours and thats why she wears all those amazing colours she does wear. She thinks dark colours are for sad times. While most of the palace festivities at Sandringham take place on Christmas Eve, Tindall went on to reveal how the family - including The Queen - sit down to watch the monarchs annual Christmas Day speech, before some members of the family enjoy an episode of Downton Abbey. When it comes to present buying, Zara Phillips splashes out on up to  gts, which get handed out at a Christmas meal for extended family a few weeks before the big day.

My we is incredible at buying presents because she takes presents for every single one of them too. Comparing his Christmases up north with his parents, Tindall described how his traditions and festive attire are very dferent.

It was suggested that Natasha Archer, who works as the Duchess of Cambridges PA and stylist, was to leave her role after being handed a Royal Victorian Orderin the New Years Honours list. The award recognises distinguished personal service to members of the royal family, but is dubbed the kiss of death because staff are usually handed such an honour when they leave their position. The -year-olds appearance on the list unsurprisingly fuelled speculation that she would be departing soon after giving birth to a baby boy named Theo last week. However, a palace spokesman last night rejected the claims telling the Mail Online: This story is totally made up - Natasha is on maternity leave. The new mum has been working with the royal family since  and was originally Kates PA.  In , she was promoted to Kates style advisor and was frequently spotted lugging around cases and suit bags on royal tours. She has played an important role in William and Kates lives - predominantly assisting the duchess with her style and travelling the world with the couple on official tours. She was spotted arriving at the Ludo Wing in St Marys Hospital following the birth of Prince Louis in April, to help the Duchess of Cambridge get ready for her public appearance. Last year, she tied the knot with world-renowned Getty royal photographer Chris Jackson after he proposed on a beach in Cornwall in . As part of his role as a royal photographer for Getty, he regularly accompanies the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Cambridge family and Meghan and Harry on official engagements.  Just  days ago, Ms Archer and Mr Jackson welcomed son Theo, who was born at Cha and Westminster Hospital in London on December . He announced the news on his Instagram account with a series of pictures of his newborn son and said he was the best present ever. He wrote: Could not be more proud of these two!! Absolute legends - I think this may be the best photo I’ve ever taken! Great to be home. Meanwhile, Meghan is set to lose close aide Samantha Cohen in the spring, a palace veteran who has served the royals for  years and is dubbed Samantha the panther.  Samanthas departure follows the recent resignation of Meghans personal assistant Melissa Touabti , who spent six months in the post. A source told the Sunday Times: Sam will be a huge loss. Going forward, Meghan might need someone cut from a slightly dferent cloth to traditional courtiers, who is not a career civil servant or royal insider.

And when you think of baked goods and sweet treats, you probably dont associate them with weight loss and health. But one man from London has proved that it is possible to eat what you want and shed some pounds at the same time. Choreographer David Hulston has managed to lose an impressive two stone in just six weeks while only eating food sold at high street bakery chain, Greggs.  The -year-old was keen to get trim for a friends wedding, so he and five other people took up a unique challenge as part of the Channel  show How to Lose Weight Well. Presenters Dr Xand van Tulleken and GP Dr Helen Lawal had contestants follow dferent diets to see which was the most effective. For the programme, David was tasked with eating no more than , calories per day and he was only allowed to consume food from Greggs Minimise Me menu. Furthermore he wasnt able to drink any alcohol during the challenge.  As part of his diet, he often chose to eat an egg roll for breakfast, a sausage roll for lunch and a coconut, lime and chili chicken salad for dinner. He also munched on snacks such as a banana and a fruit medley pot between meals. When he tired of eating the same thing, he would switch these out for red berry porridge, one slice of margherita pizza and a ham salad roll. At the start of the challenge David weighed  stone, but by the time he was done his waistline had shrunk and the scales read  stone.  Unsurprisingly he was thrilled by the results. He said: Im over the moon. I did feel hungry but Im glad I stuck to it. Im fast approaching  and want to feel fit by the time I do.

The -year-old has launched multiple verbal attacks on Meghan in the months leading up to and after her wedding to Prince Harry in May. Samantha, who has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, has branded -year-old Meghan a lair, delusional and even called her a Duch-ass on Twitter. Now, its claimed Samantha, who lives in Florida, has been added to a fixated persons list by the police royalty and specialist unit, after being identied as a risk, reports The Times.  The Duchess of Sussexs personal protection officers have reportedly briefed Scotland Yard detectives from Fixated Threat Assessment Centreabout the embarrassment of another public outburst from Samantha. The FTAC website defines fixated people as those who have an obsessional preoccupationwith a person for a perceived grievance, which they pursue to an irrational degree. According to The Times, a source commented: You cant protect someone like the Duchess of Sussex without knowing the background of her family. But someone like Samantha presents a risk rather than a threat. She is not committing criminal offences, but she is causing concerns for the royal family.  There is a big potential for some major embarrassment for the royals. Samantha could make a scene and create headlines with her actions - and lets face it, shes already kind of done that. Samantha is also reportedly working on a book about growing up alongside Meghan, called In the Shadows of Duchess, previously titled The Diary of Princess Pushys Sister. Despite months of publicly slamming her sister, Samantha claims her frequent outbursts and numerous interviews with the worlds press are a way of reaching out to the pregnant Duchess in a bid to heal the family rt. In October, Samantha made an unannounced arrival at Kensington Palace, before a widely publicised Christmas Card asking for a family truce was sent to the Duchess. Her father, Thomas Markle, also appeared on Good Morning Britain just before Christmas - calling on the Queen to intervene and resolve his row with Meghan.  The Duchess of Sussex and her dad Thomas Markle Snr havent been on speaking terms for months following the breakdown of their relationship. Mr Markle told ITVs morning show that he regularly sends text messages to Meghan, who is pregnant with her and husband Prince Harrys first child, but she never responds to them. I would appreciate anything she [the Queen] can do, and I would think that she would want to resolve family problems. All families, royal or otherwise, are the same and they should all be together, certainly around the holidays. He said of Meghan: I think shell reach out in time and Im hoping she will.

The -year-old, who has previously suffered from mental health problems, branded the experience of temporary accommodation as traumatic. She claimed Nottingham council even tried to get her to move to Derby - miles from her daughters school. Despite the numerous set-backs, her daughter, Success, had a % attendance record last year. Ms Gardner said: My relationship broke down in London so I had to come back to Nottingham as I had nothing left down there. I could not cope. I ended up with housing aid as I was in rent arrears and I became isolated and depressed.  Research had to be done to seeI had made myself intentionally homeless and I went through three dferent hotels in the six months it took for them to make a decision - which came back that I had despite my relationship breakdowns. I was all alone with my daughter then, and housing aid sent me to Loxley House and said they could help me. At one stage, Gem and her daughter were forced to stay in a hotel that didnt have electricity for three days. She said: When I complained, they threatened to kick me out. Some landlords can be horrible to deal with and take advantage of your situation. The travel costs to get my daughter to school were so expensive as we kept getting put so far away.Ms Gardner eventually got a solicitor and said it is unfortunate there is not enough concern put into where vulnerable women are getting placed. The council has now helped her get a privately rented house in Hyson Green, Nottingham She also has a job after graduating in applied social science and youth work at university, looking after a child on a one-to-one basis at a school.  She added: Im an educated woman. My situation is not who I am. It has opened my eyes to the reality of the system. It seems designed to make people fail. Its not surprising how people fall into prostitution and drugs. But when I was alone in London I thought, I have to do this for my daughter. I am hoping to get a house with my own name on it. My daughter wants to be a clothes designer and shes already wanting to help other people as well. She has written a few cards for homeless people this year. Were in a better position now, but there is always the worry about going back there. Councillor Linda Woodings, portfolio holder for housing and planning at Nottingham City Council, said: This has been a complex case and we’re glad that we’ve ultimately been able to support Ms Gardner back into permanent accommodation.  She was living in a privately-rented property with her child and came to us after her landlord evicted her for non-payment of rent. It took a lot of work to understand what had happened in Ms Gardner’s case and why she had been unable to keep up with the rent. This involved conversations with a number of partner agencies and she was temporarily housed while this took place. The use of bed-and-breakfasts and hotels is clearly not ideal, and the council remains on track to end their use for families by the end of the year. Properties are only used when they have been assessed by our safer housing team as meeting required standards. Where we’ve had concerns, the council has taken appropriate steps to help the owner improve things. Enforcement action is taken where necessary. Unfortunately, there are often restrictions in providing temporary accommodation at city-based hotels over the weekend. We have occasionally been required to move people ahead of the weekend, but always try to get them back into the same hotel so that children’s schooling isn’t disrupted.

It was when the mum-of-threes throat and eyes started to feel asthey were burning and fumes filled the air that she realised something was very wrong and rang the fire brigade. They ordered her to evacuate her home immediately and cordoned off part of her street in Nailsea, Somerset, reports Bristol Live.  Fire fighters wore breathing apparatuses as they went into the house to ventilate it, and wash away the chemicals to make it safe. Dominique, who wants to warn others of the dangers how easy it is to cause a major chemical incident, had used two bottles of ‘One Shot’ toilet unblocker. Hours later she then poured bleach down the toilet, which she she thinks one of her young children blocked by putting too much toilet paper or a toy down there. “I put the kids to bed at pm, ran a bath, then looked in the toilet and it was still blocked so I thought ‘I’m not getting into the bath like this’, she said. I’ll put my three-litre tub of bleach down there, that should do it. But the bleach mixed with the toilet unblocker still in there causing a chemical reaction and released huge quantities of chlorine gas.  “I have never experienced fumes like it,” Dominique said. “My throat and eyes feel burned.” Dominique quickly shut the bathroom door and opened the windows around the house. However, the chlorine gas began to spread and she sought help from a neighbour and rang the fire brigade, who instantly realised how serious the situation was.The family didn’t get back to bed and sleep until am the following morning. Dominique posted the story on Facebook and shared her embarrassment at having to call out the firefighters, but said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others not to do the same. While the reaction from her friends was one of concern - and a degree of humour - the incident could have been very serious, and many commented that they also had no idea that mixing two normal household materials could effectively create a poisonous gas cloud. “It was really serious,” she said. “We are all ok, but it was the dumbest thing I have ever done - please don’t do this!” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents tell hope tiny tots","story":"NewsParents tell of hope for tiny tots born into the UKs leading neonatal unitSPECIAL REPORT: The NHS youngest and smallest patients arrive here and their fate is in the hands of a team of miracle workersShareCommentsByMartyn Halle:,  DEC NewsLittle baby boy Kayden was born  weeks early and is one of the tiny fighters at Southampton Children’s Hospital \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHis eyes are shut, he is connected to a raft of tubes and wires, but look at his tiny hand… seemingly raised in a gesture of hope. Baby Kayden lies peacefully in the incubator which has been home since his premature arrival into the world last month at just  weeks. Mum Melayne Pragnell is close by, reassured by the wonderful care Kayden is receiving in the state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit at Southampton Children’s Hospital. This is where the NHS’s youngest and smallest patients are fighting for their lives – their fate in the hands of medics who perform miracles on a daily basis. Often the tots’ skin is so thin you can see through it. They are clinging on to a le that has only just begun. Last week, the Sunday Mirror was invited to visit the unit as figures show , babies – seven per cent of all UK births – arrive prematurely each year. The atmosphere is calm, professional, yet warm and friendly too. Doctors, nurses and parents talk in hushed tones because noise could hinder recovery.  An illuminated ear on the wall goes from green to amber to red to showthere’s too much noise. It is a peaceful environment of darkened rooms. Incubators are covered by towels so that the still immature eyes of their little occupants aren’t startledthe lights are turned on. Care home worker Melayne, , wasn’t due to have her baby until mid-February. She and partner Kevin McDonough, , had been trying for children for  years and endured three cycles of IVF. But in mid-November Kayden was delivered weighing just g – .lbs – after Melayne developed a shycondition called placenta previa and suffered a potentially le-threatening bleed. Tiny Kayden made good progress, but suddenly declined  days ago after developing a potentially deadly E.coli tummy bug, then sepsis and meningitis. Doctors were on hand to respond quickly and are hopeful he will make a full recovery. Kevin said: “One minute we felt we were on the home straight – he was breathing by himself and things were looking up for Christmas. Then we were faced with a situation where he might be dead by Christmas.  “The doctors were very quick with their antibiotics. They put him to sleep and then put him on a ventilator.” Consultant and mum-of-four Victoria Puddy is one of the best in the field. Since she started  years ago, shyenormous strides have been made. Victoria said: “Now we are saving babies at  weeks when a decade ago we wouldn’t have considered rescuing a child so young. And we are not just saving them, some are leaving here unscathed.” Just five per cent of premature babies are born before  weeks. At  weeks, like Kayden,  per cent survive. Medics at Southampton are also caring for the daughter of a newly-appointed colleague. Abhijit Bhattacharaya, , had been working on the unit for just a week when his we Himakshi, also , went into labour at  weeks. Abhijit said: “I knew things were not good when my boss from neo-natal intensive care came into the theatre. “Our daughter Neysha was not breathing and they took her away and worked on her for  minutes before she started breathing. We are so, so grateful for their expertise.” As Abhijit spoke his we gently cradled Neysha’s hand. And just a few feet away lay another premature baby – tiny Sarah George, born at  weeks to parents Basil, , and Simi, . Doctors are using steroids and oxygen to help her lungs develop. The -cot unit is a centre of expertise when it comes to paediatric heart and neuro surgery. Consultants will even operate on the tots in their cotthey are too fragile to be moved. Like NHS staff nationwide, the team here is dedicated to its work.

Just weeks after announcing Zaras second pregnancy, a spokesperson for the couple revealed on Christmas Eve they had sadly lost the baby. A statement said: Very sadly, Zara and Mike Tindall have lost their baby. At this dficult time, we ask that everyone respects their privacy. Now, former England rugby captain Tindall, , has revealed how the grieving couple spent a private Christmas with the Queen, who also missed the Christmas Day church service that year. Speaking about how he tried to lt the mood and cheer his we up in a silly festive suit, he said: Two years ago shewasnt feeling very well and so she didnt go to church and we had been though what wed been through - so we did our own little private - as a three. I said maybe I should be wearing something dferent today, but I was trying to raise the mood. The pair were expecting their second child - a sibling for toddler daughter Mia - in the late spring, and the baby would have been the Queen and Prince Philips sixth great-grandchild. They announced the second pregnancy at the end of November  - just weeks before their tragic loss. Earlier this year, Zara opened up about how losing their baby impacted on her and her husband as a couple. She revealed on BBC Breakfast how Mike felt helpless, saying: Its very dferent for us because were carrying the child, she said pointing to herself.  But for guys I guess its kind of that helpless feeling, which must be incredibly high and horrible for them. At the end of the day theyve still lost a child too. Being helpless is horrible isnt it... for anyone. In an interview about the “raw” effects of the first miscarriage, Zara recalled: “For me the worst thing was that we had to tell everyone – everyone we knew.” She also told how the Royal Family helped her cope. “It was a time when my family came to the fore and I needed them,” she said. “I had to go through having the baby because it was so far along.”  Zara described how the grieving process was a horrible road for her and her husband, adding: But you know actually now weve come out the end of it and hopefully it makes you stronger as a family.

The only exercise I have managed to do is hoist my legs off the floor and on to the sofa.The only weights I have managed to lt is that of the remote control. And the crisp bowl. My Dancing on Ice training took an especially big hit on Christmas Day – I am definitely one of those people who consumed a staggering average of , calories on the th, according to research. And I don’t get where that figure comes from – how can some turkey, a bit of booze and a few chocolates and Christmas pud add up to that  And that’s the problem, isn’t it  Obesity – and the strain our unhealthy lestyles put on the NHS – is on the rise.But while most of us know the dference between healthy and junk food, when it comes to knowing the calories in food, we are literally stuffed. And it’s the hidden calories manufacturers sneak in that bug me the most. I consider myself a smart and informed person who is totally aware and fully responsible for the choices I make in my le.I understand that, in order for me to lose weight, I have to consume fewer calories than I burn, no matter what diet I’m on.And I get that the daily requirements for a healthy woman is to consume , calories per day. But I am not a nutritionist, I am a busy working mum – and quite frankly I just don’t have the time or the inclination to work out how many calories are in the food I eat.And evenI think I’m making a healthy choice, that’s not always necessarily true... and here come the hidden calories, sneaking their way on to my hips.  Losing weight is not just about personal discipline, it is also about those in the food industry – shysupermarkets, pubs, restaurants and even schools – informing the public in a very simple, clear manner exactly how many calories are in their products. So I welcome Public Health England’s recommendation that there should be a calorie cap on ready meals, supermarket sandwiches and restaurant items. Chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said: “These are early days in the calorie-reduction programme, but the food industry has a responsibility to act.” What this means is they will have to revamp recipes and rethink meal offerings.The recommendations include a cap of cals on ready meals,  on restaurant mains and , on pizzas. It’s about time too. These big manufacturers have to take responsibility. They have a moral obligation to stop adding unnecessary calories in the form of sugar and fat. Why do you need to add sugar to a slice of chicken   Stealthy ways to make our food more palatable has led to sugar addiction, which causes obesity.I’m not buying excuses from manufacturers that these caps are “unrealistic” – that screams they can’t be bothered and don’t want to spend money. In this fight against obesity, everyone has to do their bit – self-discipline can only go so far. Manufacturers have to start putting morals before profits and appreciate they they play an integral part in the nation’s health.

The young couple, who had moved to the country from Shropshire under a year ago, had been sweethearts since their late teens.And Alice could not bear to live without Jason, her mum said. In the hours before her suspected suicide, the young woman had been at home while her boyfriend, , was out with friends.  Rugby player Jason reportedly enjoyed a Christmas drink with his pals during the catch up on December , before a cab was called.He is then said to have called Alice, telling her he would be back at their home in Stanley Street, Scarborough,“in a couple of minutes”.However, not long after, at around pm, sirens began wailing and Alice noticed flashing lights from emergency services vehicles.

Carol Smith, Combat Stress director of client services, said: “We absolutely do not want to reduce the hours.“Our helpline is the first port of call for veterans seeking help and it isreally important they are able to contact us at any time of the day or night.“A lot of calls are made at night because often people with mental health conditions find it dficult to sleep.

That said, it should be memorable because of how special it was and how much fun you had - not because your ex-we crashed the reception and ruined everything. This was the nightmare situation one couple found themselves in when the grooms ex found out about their big day and wasnt too happy about it. Instead of a perfect and romantic series of events, the pair were faced with screaming, assault and eventually an arrest. The whole shocking story was revealed on boredpanda by a kind doughnut shop manager who ultimately ended up coming to the rescue of the newlyweds.The unnamed manager starts by saying that an hour before closing a woman, who claimed to be a wedding coordinator, called the store. Desperately she askedthey would give her a few minutes of their time as she needs to buy any and all of the doughnuts she can. They explain: She says the wedding cake has been destroyed and the bride has been a huge fan of doughnuts since childhood and is willing to substitute.  The manager agrees to help and the woman arrives at the shop within ten minutes, quickly buying as many sweet treats as she can get her hands on. She pretty much wipes out all our stock and snags the biggest cream puff we have for the ceremonial doughnut, they continue. As shes getting ready to pay I ask her to wait just a moment. In a fit of inspiration, I grab some eclairs and write, congrats on one and the names of the couple on the other two in frosting. She thanks me profusely and runs out the door. A few weeks go by and the doughnut store manager begins to forget all about the bizarre incident - until a happily married couple pays the shop a visit.  They proceeded to thank the staff for helping them and reveal what really happened that night. The groom had an apparently psycho ex, who had been stalking them and found out about the wedding, the manager said. She became enraged that he was getting remarried. She stormed into the venue, grabbed the wedding cake, and chucked it at the newlyweds! I mean she-hulking a beautul three-tier cake! The ex is then said to have started shouting, before grabbing some wine bottles and smashing them on the ground - much to everyones horror.  Thankfully the groomsmen managed to restrain her and called the police, who charged the woman with assault, assault with a weaponand destruction of private property. The cake was ruined, as was the brides gown, but the couple somehow managed to enjoy the rest of the evening and even showed off a sweet shot of them cutting the ceremonial eclairs with huge grins. The shop manager added: The we was laughing and smiling in all the pictures, even with cake and frosting splattered all over her once gorgeous dress. She said it was going to be one of those stories that shes going to laugh about with her kids in years to come.

From homemade items that didnt quite go to plan, to last minute gts purchased on the way over, we thought wed seen it all. But one man has raised the bar for unusual presents by purchasing DNA testing kits for his entire family - and the bemusing item almost ruined Christmas for everyone. The unnamed son revealed all in a post online, which has had thousands of views.  Taking to Reddit, the man starts his story by revealing that earlier in the year AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit and for some reason he thought it would be a great gt, so he bought six of them - one for himself, his mum, his dad, brother and two sisters. However when it came time to open presents on December , the kits didnt exactly garner the reaction hed been hoping for. He wrote: As soon as everyone opened their gt, my mom started freaking out. She told us she didnt want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money.  The children were still keen to give the tests a go which caused an argument to break out between the parents. According to the post, the pair went upstairs and argued for about an hour, leaving the four kids to wonder what exactly was going on. At this point, the man truly thought hed f***** up and ruined the family Christmas. But then things took a surprising turn.  His parents eventually came back down and shared some shocking news with them all - one of them had a dferent dad. He explained: Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her le, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. The parents went on to share stories and photos for the first time and the son claims the experience brought them even closer together as a family.  He added: This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get out test results. Merry Christmas everyone! More than , people have taken the time to comment on his post, with many sharing their own unusual family stories. One person wrote: I was adopted by my grandparents and didnt know until I was older. The person I grew up with as an older sister was actually my biological mother. Another said: My friend discovered through AncestryDNA that her grandpa wasnt actually her grandpa. Her actual grandpa was one of her grandparents neighbours. A third added: I work at AncestryDNA. This actually happens all the time.

Beth Golding, a primary school worker from Canterbury, sat down over Christmas to watch what she thought was the  animated movie Treasure Planet with her toddler Eli. But shortly after the film started playing she soon realised that something wasnt quite right - and that her young son definitely shouldnt be watching what was happening on screen.   Instead of purchasing a Disney DVD from the Canterbury branch of Poundland, the -year-old had actually bought a copy of The Exorcist . Directed by William Friedkin, The Exorcist is a disturbing horror movie starring Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Max von Sydow and Jason Miller. It tells the tale of a mother and two priests attempting to save a child possessed by a demon, and has previously been named one of the scariest films of all time.   The young mum said when the movie started it looked dark and scary and thankfully after a few minutes her partner decided to switch it off. They then removed the disc from the DVD player only to discover what they had really been watching and to say the family was shocked would be an understatement. Luckily my son didnt see anything, but thats not the point, she explained. He could have seen something he shouldnt have.   Beth called the store soon after to complain and was told tothe DVD and get her pound back, but she wasnt concerned about the money.

It’s a step back in the right direction and, hopefully, be a good point in the end.“Livingston’s gameplan was to go direct and put balls into the box to make things hard for us but I felt we stood up to it very well, I can’t think of them having a clear chance.“A draw was probably a fair result but I felt we were the better team.Hopefully, it’s a good point come the end of the season.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c1cc286b0142-458x564.jpg ","title":"takeover talk was none of our business says dundee united defender","story":"Defender Callum Booth says the Dundee United takeover and the speculation in the run-up to it was never a big topic of conversation in the dressing-room.And the full-back admits there was much more gossip in the squad after Csaba Laszlo’s departure at the end of December.However, he concedes what new American owner Mark Ogren does once the transfer window opens next week will be grabbing the attention of him and his team-mates.“I would say we were more focused on the speculation surrounding the club when we didn’t have a manager,” said the -year-old former Partick Thistle man.“Then that was what all the players were talking about. It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c23494787682.jpg ","title":"wasted emergency services spent a fortnight attending hoax calls","story":"Tayside#s emergency fire and ambulance crews have spent nearly a fortnight responding to hoax calls over the past four years, the Tele can reveal.Hundreds of calls have been made to both services which have led to a turn-out of staff, only for them to find it was malicious.Firefighters have spent more than , minutes – a total of  hours or more than  days – responding to such incidents since -.The majority of those calls involved fire alarms being activated deliberately, but they have also attended  reports about dangerous buildings, crashes and people in distress.In -, crews spent more time attending hoax calls than any of the previous two years, at more than , minutes.Between April and November this year, the figure stood at , minutes.Terry Whyte, local representative for the Fire Brigades Union , said crews are working hard to inform children about the implications of making   calls.He said: “The FBU has been working with the fire and rescue service to try to drive this down.“It’s down to education, such as going into schools and teaching kids about how important it is.“Our officers could be tied up with something  when there is a much more serious incident going on where.“We are constantly out speaking to kids about the dangers of making these kind of calls.“If there’s a specic area that we’re getting these calls from, then we’ll go out to it.“We certainly won’t be slowing down in trying to stop it happening for good.”Meanwhile, paramedics in Tayside have also been on the receiving end of malicious calls – most frequently in Dundee.Ambulance staff in the city have spent a total of , minutes responding to hoax calls since - – equal to about  hours, or more than two days. vw, px\"  And figures suggest that - is on track to be the worst year of the last four – with more than  minutes already spent on hoax incidents since April, more than the whole of - and just short of figures from - or -.Callers have ly reported patients having breathing problems, traumatic injuries, chest pains, burns, drowning and even stabbing or gunshot wounds, during their malicious calls.A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: “Anyone who calls  without a genuine need is potentially putting lives at risk by tying up valuable resources that could be needed for a le-threatening call.“When appropriate, malicious or nuisance callers are reported to the police.“However, in many cases, the call is a result of a social issue rather than malice and the patient may still need assistance.“In these cases, the relevant agencies are advised so appropriate care can be provided.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We condemn hoax calls to our emergency services.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

In the past eight years, we have helped over  homeless iniduals and families in this way.#Over the past four years, we have also gted emergency food packs to those who have no food, or money to buy it. Last year we provided  food parcels, including a special Christmas pack for families in need. We have helped more than  households this way.#In addition, Mo-Ma has made awards to help young people at school with expenses such as clothing.Sandy continued: #Mo-Ma welcomes the support of the Co-op and its foodbank bin, which has made a valuable contribution to what we can provide and reducing our costs. The support of local organisations which have made donations, whether food or financial, to Mo-Ma is much appreciated.#Working with referrals through organisations such as Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice Bureau , Mo-Ma tends to do good work quietly, in the background.Gillian McInnes, ABCAB manager, said: #Mo-Ma provides a vital service to people who are often not in the happiest of circumstances. Their food parcels are specically aimed at a family#s inidual circumstances, so the service is fantastic.#People often approach ABCAB in financial dficulty or in fairly chaotic situations. It is all too easy to think that nobody cares, but through its work Mo-Ma helps to reduce stress and help people.#Sandy Taylor added: #As we approach Christmas, a time for families for friendship and for enjoying time together at home, it is heartening for those of us involved to see a growing awareness and desire from people across our community to contribute to our work, in support of those less well off than ourselves.#"},{"url":null,"title":"raising vital money for baby unit","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA coffee morning was held on Thursday December  to raise funds ahead of Joan Williamson#s brave Loony Dook dunk.As well as tea, coffee and nibbles, a table full of baskets was set up to raise funds.Ardrishaig woman Joan held the coffee morning in Lochgilphead Parish Church to raise money and encourage donations to the Simpsons Special Care Babies unit in Edinburgh, ahead of her e into the icy waters off South Queensferry on New Year#s Day.The Simpsons Special Care Babies unit looked after Joan and her twin daughters Angel and Star when they were born prematurely.

For myself, it has two principal components.The first is light. Most societies had and have a celebration of light at the darkest time of the year. It is a pattern followed by most of the world#s great religions.The religious reference is not only to the physical darkness of the sun being below the equator, but also the psychological darkness caused by uncertainty, loss, suffering of the body or the mind, broken relationships and the brokenness of many lives.By allowing the light of Christ to shine into our lives and bring comfort, guidance, courage, strength, we can change direction, start again and have cause for celebration.The second aspect is of birth. It really does not matter where or when Jesus was born. As Paul writes: #Jesus was born of a woman#, as we all were. The birth of a child, the gt of le, with all the potential each child has to become fully themselves.Jesus#s birth was no more or no less important to Mary and toThis time of year gives us the opportunity to celebrate le and perhaps, as the years pass and we look back, to reflect on how we have used our gts and talents.Is the world a better place because I we have walked this way  Is the world a better place because the Christ has walked this way If you are together as family, be happy together. Le is too valuable to spoil a celebration. If you are alone, I trust there are folk around you who will share with you.Whoever you are, may the light and the love of Christ#s coming bless you as you journey.PIC:Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell. _aRevCampbellAs isional commander, I sincerely hope this very special time of year is one that is fun-filled, enjoyed by all, and everyone is kept safe.It’s also a time for reflection. For my own part, I’m amazed at how quickly the year has passed.  has been a satisfying year as our strong local partnerships with our local authorities and other service providers have been built on to ensure close collaboration as problems arose.This approach delivered on our shared priorities to enhance the lives of iniduals in need of our support, and continued to nurture a safe and thriving environment for inidual and community wellbeing.We have faced several signicant challenges, not least the ‘Beast from the East’ extreme winter that caused such disruption across the country.During this Year of Young People, I am proud that the ision has continued to lead the way in Police Scotland in our innovative deployment of Youth Engagement Officers. Their interactions with young people make many positive interventions in their lives. We’ve also continued to grow the number of our teams of active and enthusiastic Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Police Scotland#s festive campaign provides useful advice regarding protecting you your home and property, and safety advice for shopping and using ATMs. Please check this on our social media pages.I hope you all enjoy the New Year and I encourage all to take care throughout the festive period.PIC:Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren. _aHazelHendrenI am very glad to have the opportunity to wish everyone across Argyll and Bute all the very best for this festive season. Argyll is stunning in the summer months when the sun shines but even as the nights get longer and the days colder there is still so much to enjoy from our glittering winter landscapes to the warmth of our many whiskies.When I look back over the past  months at le in Argyll and Bute, there is one thing that really stands out – the tremendous sense of community spirit, pride and positivity that’s sweeping through our communities of late.We have our challenges to face – that’s inescapable. But over the past year in particular I’ve been so encouraged to see the determination of local people to rise above those challenges and make sure that local le is as vibrant and successful as possible.  We’re all spreading the word that Argyll and Bute really is a great place to live, work, visit and do business – all year round.Wherever you are in Argyll and Bute, I hope you enjoy the festive season and that  brings you what you need. A Happy New Year to you all.PIC:Councillor Aileen Morton. no_aAileen-MortonMay I begin by wishing each of you a peaceful New Year.I think it is important that we take a bit of time  out of time to appreciate what we have but also to think of those less fortunate than ourselves andpossible, resolve to do something that will make a dference to someone’s le this festive season.Shamefully, despite the United Kingdom being the sixth largest economy in the world, more and more of our friends, neighbours and colleagues here in Argyll and Bute will have to rely on food banks and charities to get them through the season.It beggars belief that in , increasing numbers of mums, dads, children, pensioners, those in low-paid work, people seeking work, those living with mental health issues or a disability, have gone hungry and more and more children had nothing to unwrap on Christmas morning.And without the generosity of the people of Argyll and Bute and the wonderful work being done by an army of volunteers, the situation would be so much worse.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour.

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

In recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month. And residents at Girvan Community Council raised questions over the lack of CCTV along Dalrymple Street. Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks. Cllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the Girvan community. He said: “It is fantastic - I think it has highlighted the fact that when we had the incidents of vandalism, how important CCTV is for protecting our town centres. “I’m glad that the ones we have are ing, but more to the point - I am really delighted that the new CCTV is on the way. “I think it is a win-win situation for the community of Girvan.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"school becomes single campus two","story":"NewsSchool becomes single campus as two main parts join upThe transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House.ShareByStephen Houston:,  DEC NewsWellington school is now a single campus \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe two main parts of Wellington School have become one. The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this. One of the endearing things about the Europeans, and I say this as a Brexiteer, is their cafe culture.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

last of the countyrsquos infant schools will disappear and a new single school will be created.However, there are no plans to move buildings, with the new merged school run across the two former education establishments.Until now the schools in the town had P-Ps attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P.However, both schools operated their own curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had opposed it.Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, said that following those results she had arranged to meet face to face with parents at public meetings in a bid to tackle their concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that there had been concerns from some parents but pointed to a recent inspection at Prestonpans Primary School which had called for additional support to be given to the school after grading its performance as weak in parts.He said: ldquoWe know we have and have had great teachers, inspiring headteachers and great support staff and yet we receive these reports.ldquoWe owe it to the children of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"wakey-wakey-kids-schools-starting-earlier","story":"East Lothianrsquos six secondary schools have traditionally set their own timetables ndash leading to dferent start and finish times, as well as a range of lunch breaks.East Lothian Council carried out a public consultation over plans to synchronise the days to bring all the schools in line with one another.And, after nearly three quarters of those surveyed gave the thumbs up to the change, Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, recommended all schools have a -period week.All six schools will finish their day earlier than usual under the new proposal ndash with a .pm midweek home time.And five of the six face an earlier start with only Ross High School, Tranent, already starting its timetable with the .am registration which will now be across the board.Pupils at Musselburgh Grammar will start their day  minutes earlier than present, while at Knox Academy, Haddington, it is  minutes earlier.Youngsters at Preston Lodge, North Berwick High School and Dunbar Grammar will also have roughly  minutes less time in bed.Mrs Robertson told a council meeting on Tuesday that the next stage would be consulting with ldquokey stakeholders, including trade unions and the people who provide home to school transport, over a phased introduction of the new timetables.It will also likely lead to a change in school day hours for some primary schools who share transport with their high schools, to ensure the needs of pupils can still be met.Earlier proposals to set down a new common day for primary schools and increase P and P hours to  a week, instead of the current . hours, have been shelved.Mrs Robertson said that the common school day for secondary schools would improve inclusion and make it easier for schools to work together.Three of the secondary schools ndash Musselburgh Grammar, Dunbar Grammar and Knox Academy, Haddington ndash have said they will be ready to introduce the new timetable in August next year.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-ministers-book-of-poetry-inspired-by-the-bible","story":"The Rev Jock Stein, along with we Margaret, was joint locum minister at Cockenzie Old Parish Church before stepping down in .Originally he started writing one poem for each of the  books in the Bible and then, encouraged by friends, expanded his poetic project further.He said: ldquoThey said to me it was daft just to approach it that way as it would be too complicated and folk might not understand it, so it was suggested I focus on people and their stories, which is why From Cosmos to Canaan is the first of many volumes.ldquoIn it I examine key issues and use poetry to give a new slant on it.

Before bringing its Budget back to Parliament, the SNP must think again.One of the social security levers provided to Holyrood after the independence referendum was the ability to \"top up\" reserved benefits.Ahead of Finance Secretary Derek Mackayrsquos draft Budget in December, a coalition of academics, charities and anti-poverty groups called on the minority SNP administration to boost child benefit by pound.In a separate letter to Mackay, senior church figures also demanded the Government act with ldquogreater urgency by backing the same policy.The benefit, which is taxable for some high-earning families, is currently worth pound. a week for the eldest child and pound. for additional children. A pound-a-week rise for each child has been costed at around pound million.However, Mackay snubbed the calls and the Government is sticking with its plan of introducing an ldquoincome supplement by , which could be after the next Holyrood election.New figures, produced by Scottish Labour, show that over half-a-million families would receive a boostthe policy was introduced next year.The statistics also reveal that , families with more than one child would see their income topped up by at least pound a year.Around , families with two children would receive the pound-plus rise, as would , family units with three children, and over , families with four or more kids.In Glasgow, nearly , families fit into this category, while the figure for central Scotland is closer to ,.Critics of the proposal believe topping up the benefit, first introduced in , is an inefficient way of lting some of the , children out of poverty.At First Ministerrsquos Questions earlier this year Nicola Sturgeon said the policy would result in a ldquodrop in child poverty of ldquojust two percentage points, adding: ldquoI am not saying that that is insignicant, but we are committed to introducing an income supplement, and in doing so we must ensure that the money that is invested in it has maximum effectiveness in tackling child poverty.She also said that pound out of every pound would go to families who are not living in poverty.Children are deemed to be living in povertythey are in households with less than  per cent of median household income.Leonard told this newspaper: ldquoOur communities are being held back by austerity. The fact that one-in-four children in Scotland are spending Christmas living in poverty is nothing short of a national outrage. Children in poverty cannot wait for help, they need it now. Before bringing its budget back to Parliament the SNP must think again.ldquoLabourrsquos plan to top-up Child Benefit by pound per week will mean more than quarter of a million families across Scotland will be pound better off.\"John Dickie, chair of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: \"There is no question that families need an immediate boost to their incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing.

We use green energy and wersquore going to start growing our own vegetables.A couple of weeks ago I went into Fort William town centre, and I talked to local cafes about using plastic straws because to make plastic you use fossil fuels. We recently had a meeting because wersquore trying to create a Fort William Extinction Rebellion group so we can do some action in .I think, politically, there just needs to be much more action, because politicians and leaders are having all these climate talks but nothing is actually happening. We could tax CO, we could tax meat to encourage more sustainable and ethical eating, but that isnrsquot happening. The politicians and the government need to be doing much more.Irsquove been reading about it and the UK government is planning to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent by , which is not enough. There need to be zero greenhouse gas emissions by  worldwide.There are still people in my class who donrsquot think that climate change exists. I think that one thing that needs to happen in  is for schools to start educating young people on climate change. There needs to be more awareness. In one of my classes at high school we had some lessons on the global goals and it was depressing that climate action is number  when it should be number one.Irsquove seen quite a few of the talks by Greta Thunberg [the teenage activist who has inspired a generation with her climate strikes] and, in fact, after the holidays Irsquom going to start climate striking ndash only for an hour every Friday. Irsquom just going to sit outside school for an hour in the morning. Irsquom trying to get other people involved but on February  therersquos going to be a UK-wide school strike.Parisa Shirazi, I work for an MP, and I come at this question from what Irsquove seen in casework. There are a lot of things which make you very angry.When yoursquore working in an MPrsquos office a lot of things that you deal with are to do with social security and immigration cases and what I see day in and day out is that perfectly ordinary, good people are being treated with a hell of a lot of scepticism. We see people whose benefits are being cut, people who are very ill being dragged in for disability assessments, people who are just applying for visiting visas for their familythey have a new baby in the UK and just facing blanket refusals.So what I would like to see I less cynicism towards certain groups of people. There is a lot of scepticism towards people in the benefits system. There seems to be a lack of appreciation of the fact that the system is paid into by everyone and itrsquos thereanyone needs it. Thatrsquos what the welfare state is for ndash itrsquos not to demonise a certain group of people.Irsquove not always been political. I grew up in Northern Ireland, apathetic towards politics. I moved away when I was , studied in Durham and did my masters in Edinburgh.I feel exhausted by Brexit. I feel like it was an enormous amount of upheaval for no gain. It just fills me with despair. Becauseyou study a law degree, as I did, you hear about things like disability rights and other rights that were brought about by being part of the EU.Sanna Aziz, \"I do a lot of campaigning around race equality. What I would like to see in  is a lot more research into the racial wage gap. There is not enough prominent research into what it is like for women of colour to be in the workplace and get paid so little compared to their white or male counterparts. I would also like to see some actual work being done in that area, in trying to make that equality, some sort of initiatives so therersquos a whole government drive towards that goal.Last year I went to the United States on an exchange set up in Jo Coxrsquos memory. It was inspiring. We visited so many dferent organisations. We went just after Trump was elected and they were talking about the amount of hate crime that was spiked then in the US. The organisations there felt like they were getting pushed back, but they were still pushing forward. They were saying no matter what happens just keep pushing forward because eventually you will make change.What drives me is that when I was a kid, I experienced a lot of racially based bullying. I used to get so upset about it, but when I was older and in high school before I left, I talked to the kid and I asked him why and he didnrsquot have a proper reason for why.From then I realised a lot of it is done out of ignorance, so from then on I tried to prevent people being as ignorant, and make them come to terms with the damage they can do when theyrsquore being racist or homophobic.Irsquom studying international politics at Stirling University. A large part of me is really nervous to go into the jobs market. But again, Irsquom hopeful. Irsquom just hopeful that everything will work out and my generation will be able to maybe not fix things, but improve them.I want to see more consideration for what iniduals experience on a day-to-day basis when theyrsquore of colour.

Those things are not severe enough for people to say itrsquos a hate crime. Itrsquos just a day to day stigma around people of colour that I want us to get rid of. I know it wonrsquot happen overnight. It probably wonrsquot happen in the next ten years but Irsquom hopeful.Hannah Brisbane, ldquoIn  I would like to see more girls having more confidence and speaking out on issues that matter to them and being invited into important discussions. With Girl Guiding Scotland next year wersquore developing a youth forum and my role with them is helping lead to that. Irsquom really excited to give our members a space to speak out on issues that effect girls and young women.Irsquove had lots of opportunities over the past four years. Irsquove given evidence at the Scottish Parliament in committees and met MPs and MSPs. So I definitely feel that Irsquove been listened to and Irsquom keen to help other girls have that same experience. Irsquove done a lot of work on sexual harassment and in particular harassment in schools.Research we did a few years ago found that two-thirds of girls had experienced some sort of harassment in school. Thatrsquos unacceptable and we had the opportunity to bring that evidence to the Scottish Parliament and do some work with them on how we can change things, for instance develop Personal and Social Education.We started that work before the Weinstein scandal came out. Movements like MeToo and TimesUp have forced people to take these issues more seriously.Brexit makes the year ahead really uncertain. I voted Remain and Irsquom definitely worried about losing certain rights. For instance I was on an Erasmus exchange year last year and after school I worked for a year to save up to go travelling around Europe. I do French and politics at Edinburgh University, so I feel that possibilities from that might be more limited. Irsquod hope that those rights that we had will remain but no one knows what will happenNicola Sturgeon is probably one of my political heroes. I remember looking up to her even when she was just Health Secretary and thinking that women can be a force to be reckoned with in politics.Joe Hesmondhalgh, \"My biggest concern is climate change and the current climate crisis. Itrsquos always been on my radar, but the UN report that came out in September really brought it to my attention. It said we had twelve years to stop the worst effects of the potential climate crisis and that terried me. What is also terrying to me is the lack of urgency from our government and powerful institutions and the media.I got involved in Extinction Rebellion, a climate action group that uses non-violent, disruptive methods to get our voices heard, in November. I helped set up the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow group but also the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow University group and Irsquove been involved in two direct actions so far. Irsquom willing to be arrested for this because itrsquos the most important thing there is.When I think of all of the issues I care about, climate change will make all of them worse. I really care about homelessness ndash it will make that worse. I really care about human rights ndash it will make that worse. I really am willing to get arrested for it. I think a lot of other people are too.Brexit is obviously an issue which is going to have a big impact on my le, but when therersquos such a massive, global crisis looming, it almost feels like itrsquos a distraction. Wersquove got twelve years to save the planet and the Brexit negotiations will probably take that long to wrap. When you see the massive resources that are being put into Brexit negotiations and preparations fortherersquos a No Deal, it just seems crazy. We could be putting all those resources into averting climate change.What Irsquod like to see, in , is the Extinction Rebellion key demands happen. A commitment to zero carbon emissions by  would be a step in the right direction from the UK government. As a rich country, our government and us, as the public, have to take the lead in trying to avert the climate breakdown. I think creating fair climate policy is also a democratic issue.This is the first time Irsquove ever got involved in any direct action ndash for two reasons. Firstly, the UN climate change report had an impact on me and, secondly, I think Extinction Rebellion feels genuinely dferent. It feels like wersquove been signing petitions and writing to MPs for years and this is fresh and new and it exciting. Wersquove tried all the non-disruptive methods. I think itrsquos time to try disruptive methods.For a while I wasnrsquot optimistic about the future. Hearing, over the years, all the evidence and reports about climate change does make you cynical and it makes you want to switch off, but I think, after joining Extinction Rebellion and other groups, Irsquove stopped feeling miserable or cynical. I felt the same about homelessness but then I started volunteering at Shelter. I think working together with other people really does make you feel better about it. I think the best way to not feel miserable about these things is to do something about it alongside other people.\"Callum Lynch, \" is the year that Scotland has the opportunity to fundamentally reshape what a childhood can be for people who are or have grown up in care. I went into care when I was  and while that meant I was saved from the neglect that I lived in, it also meant spending the rest of my childhood surrounded by legal processes and professionalism.I had staff, not parents. I lived in a unit, not a home. I was physically restrained by the people who looked after me when it was deemed I wasnrsquot being compliant. I was part of routine conversations about whether it was a good idea for me to live in the same place as my brother, even though he was the only person who understood my le.I hear versions of this still,  years on, compounded by the fact that young people still donrsquot have the right to independent advocacy in legal meetings where enormous decisions are made about their le. Hope has, for many, felt like something hard to find in . I have felt like a bit of an anomaly this year because I have relished political conversations.Having spent the year campaigning and speaking to politicians from every party, I know that while there are fundamental disagreements about our constitutional make-up, there is political will to do something dferent for care experienced people. I believe that our politicians want something revolutionary to happen for those are or have been looked after by the state. \"Erin McAuley, ldquoA lot of our lives are very precarious. Although therersquos a lot more opportunity therersquos little security or stability. A lot of the jobs that young people are facing are insecure or are short-term contracts or are not well paid in comparison to the standard of living.It seems to be that therersquos a whole chunk of young people in Britain who are stuck in this precarious cycle of high rents and insecure work, low pay. That includes students. Irsquove qualied as a teacher recently, but to sustain myself at uni Irsquove worked all my four years. Irsquom in retail now, on a short-term contract.Itrsquos not unusual for young people to be in and out of short-term contracts. And something that frustrates me in work is that Irsquom doing exactly the same work as maybe my colleague younger than me or my colleague older than me, but wersquore all getting a dferent pay based on our age. Thatrsquos something that shouldnrsquot be happening.Irsquom chair of the Unite Youth Committee. Within that committee our three big things are the pay disparity among young people, mental health and rent. If I could wave a wand in , I would have something done about the price of housing, whether thatrsquos through rent caps or more social housing. But also I would change the world of work, and not have any zero-hour contracts and have wages that people feel they can sustain themselves on.Mental health is another thing that I would want to solve. There is a mental ill health epidemic and no wonder, given wersquove got an insecure job market, and insecure housing, plus so much more pressure on young people, with Instagram and twitter, to feel validated.Irsquove always campaigned for mental health services, partly because of my own experiences. I went to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicewhen I was  but then I got moved straight to the adult service because there was not a young adult service, and it was just a long waiting list. My magic wand for Scotland for mental health would be to bring in a - service.Bryn Evans, ldquoThe thing I most worry about to do with the world right now is Brexit. When the referendum happened, I was hopeful that the vote would go towards Remain so when it got announced that we were going to leave, it shocked me.A few of my friends are from a iety of dferent European countries and they are not scared but worried for their future in this country. I think some are just going to leave Scotland and not come back.The two things I would most hope to happen in  are Brexit not happening or Trump being put out of power."},{"url":null,"title":"ice-hockey-team-sends-toys-to-sick-children-in-malawi","story":"Glasgow Clanrsquos annual ldquoAir the Bear event sees supporters throw new toys on to the ice for local charities such as Glasgowrsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children and this year itwill also benefit the Malaria Alert Centre in Blantyre, Malawi.The team has joined forces with the University of Glasgow to ship toys to Blantyre, Malawi, to give to children waking up from a malaria coma.Scientists at the University of Glasgowrsquos Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation and the Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitologyhave close research links with Malawi.When travelling to Malawi for research scientists use their baggage allowance to take donations of surplus medical supplies and equipment to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi.On their next research trip their luggage will also include the toys from the ldquoair the bear event which took place at Braehead Arena in December.Gareth Chalmers, Glasgow Clan chief operating officer, said: ldquoWe were recently approached by Clan fan Michael Rennie, who works as a research technician at the University of Glasgow, regarding supporting the Malaria Alert Centre with soft toys from our annual Air the Bear event.ldquoAs itrsquos for a very worthwhile cause, we had no hesitation in agreeing to support this.He thanked supporters for their generosity.Professor Andy Waters, WCMP director, said: ldquoWe have been providing toys for these children in Malawi for some time now, usually pre-used and donated by colleagues and their friends.ldquoIt is dficult to overstate how appreciated the toys are by the children and their families who have just come through the most stressful of circumstances.ldquoThe fantastic generosity of the Glasgow Clan Ice Hockey team will ensure that more Blantyre children will be comforted as they pull through a le-threatening illness due to the skill and dedication of the staff at Malawirsquos QEH."},{"url":null,"title":"take-grandparents-on-holiday-minister-for-loneliness-tells-families","story":"Mims Davies said Britons could learn from the example of Mediterranean nations, where families involve the older generations more in their daily lives.And she said communities had a ldquomoral duty to stop the elderly feeling abandoned, urging employers to give staff more time off to care for parents.Speaking to the Sunday , Ms Davies said:ldquoVery often you will be out on holiday ndash a few of you in a small British family ndash and you will find this huge, wonderful plethora of people on the beach.ldquoAnd you will think, lsquoGod, doesnrsquot that look fun rsquoldquoWe are just a little bit blinkered.

It showcases his achievements.\"He achieved a lot in his career but his downfall was alcohol, that fed into his convictions - such as for drink driving.\"For Kerrigan, who is writing a book called Finding Benny, Lynch is a tragic, complex figure who the city should be proud of.\"There is no excuse for [domestic violence] but there can be causes,\" he adds.\"He has no convictions from before . If you want to look for a cause [drink] is one of them.\"Every single one of the newspaper reports mention that he was intoxicated. He was a flawed character.\"We are reframing things based on todays social norms and taking these incidents as standalone events then yes, we have to condemn them.\"But there wasnt the help then that there is now.\"Benny Lynch didnt get a second chance to recover or recant. All the problems in his le killed him. He died.\"Marsha Scott, chief executive of Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, would disagree. \"In the same breath as we often hear that there is no excuse for domestic abuse, we also hear that it is by and large the fault of alcohol, mental health, poverty, fame, or in historical cases ndash the product of a society with dferent morals to those we have now,\" she said.\"Those conveniently forgotten in this discourse are of course victim-survivors, the women who experience pain ndash physical and emotional ndash inflicted by abusers.\"In our view it is their strength and courage that merits celebrating, not those responsible for doing harm.\"There are records of Lynch trying to seek help for his alcoholism. He was sent to England for treatment and he would take the ferry to a monastery in Ireland to try and dry out.As Mr Kerrigan says, he \"shook it off\" but as soon as he was back in his former circles, the old problems would begin again.Under the influence of drink, Lynch racked up a slew of criminal convictions, including drink driving and child abuse.Liverpool Echo, Wednesday, October , .

He was fighting it, he knew it was killing him and hurting him and his family.\"Whether Lynch would have recovered from his alcoholism is impossible to say, and what he would have done during recovery ndash make amends or not ndash is similarly unknowable.What we do know is that famous sportsmen are often given a free pass simply because they are talented, they generate money for their clubs and they have legions of supporters willing to overlook their abuses of power.What would a statue for Benny Lynch say about modern Glasgow \"We are erecting a statue to someone who has these dark sides and to an extent I would agree that theres a thing of celebrity where we bend light around certain people, no matter what they have done,\" Kerrigan adds.\"I think its a celebrity problem, rather than a sport problem.

A lot of people from the past that we celebrate are very flawed characters and can we really judge them by modern standards \"Half of the artists in the citys collections have very colourful pasts and yet people revere them. What do we do about that \"Jimmy Boyle is revered as an artist and yet he spent time in Barlinnies Special Unit for much worse crimes ndash domestic abuse is a terrible crime ndash but this man committed murder.\"And people revere him as an artist. Do people not deserve a second chance \"For feminist groups, who have argued these points endlessly, the answer is straightforward.

McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Sunday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings. However, more recently windows on the higher first floor were also damaged.

It also opens on New Yearrsquos Day with a ldquowalk-off-the-hangover brunch and is promising more mouth-watering baklava from the Aleppo Bakers.Verity added: ldquoLocals of my age will remember how Mario Pagliari at his Merrythought Cafeacute used to always have his ice cream machine going over Christmas and New Year.

Well done to Pat Munro for taking an interest in the company and especially as it is local. Good luck with your negotiations.Another added: ldquoWell done Brian Munro. A good deal done there.The award-winning Carbon Dynamic, based at the Cromarty Firth Industrial Park, announced earlier this month it was unable to continue trading due to ldquochallenging conditions and signicant cash-flow dficulties.As a result,  local jobs were made redundant with just two workers kept on.But on Wednesday joint administrators Blair Nimmo and Geoff Jacobs of KPMG said the business had been sold to Pat Munro, safeguarding the future of the firm.Carbon DynamicLimited, a new company, has been set up to facilitate the purchase.Mr Nimmo said: ldquoIt is extremely pleasing to secure the sale of Carbon Dynamic in such a short time-frame, and to buyers who can see the potential in the business and its skilled workforce. The sale has achieved a good outcome for many stakeholders and we hope it will benefit the local area.ldquoAs new owners, Pat Munro has an ambitious vision to build on Carbon Dynamicrsquos reputation for cutting-edge design and manufacture of eco-friendly modular buildings, re-employing a number of Carbon Dynamicrsquos former staff and contributing to the ersity of the economy in the Scottish Highlands.Brian Munro, managing director of Pat Munro, which is one of the largest privately owned contractors operating in the Highlands, said: ldquoWe collaborated [with Carbon Dynamic in previous successful projects and were very saddened to learn of the financial situation which threatened the future of  important local jobs.

Pat Munro will take good care of it.

As we enter  and the final countdown to Brexit, I share the sense of deep frustration felt by many.Anger with a Tory Prime Minister who is dragging the UK towards a clf edge with the hardline Brexiteers who don’t care about the impact on workers and with the leader of my own party who is prepared to facilitate a reckless withdrawal from the EU.That Brexit will deliver economic hardship for our country is beyond doubt. It is constitutional vandalism of the very worst kind, which will hit the poorest the hardest.Shame on those who are unwilling to stand up for the communities in the firing line. Your actions will not be forgotten.But there is another emotion as well: sadness.By the end of March, we are destined to walk away from the most important peace process the modern world has ever seen.It will decimate opportunity for the next generation, and send a signal to the world that we no longer believe in cooperation and togetherness, and instead we stand for isolationism and nationalism.I believe in solidarity and the breaking down of borders. That’s why I oppose both Scottish independence and Brexit. As the words on the back of my Labour membership card state – “by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone” – words that Jeremy Corbyn should reflect upon.I am Scottish, British and European, and Brexit is not going to take that away from me.But it is going to take away the opportunities that come with being part of the European Union.Over  years as an MEP, I have witnessed the EU expand and reform to bring nations closer together in the interests of co-operation and peace.The expansion that delivered membership to countries like Poland and Romania was a success that brought huge idends for those nations as well as our own.The economic contribution of EU migrants to Britain is beyond question. That so many workers, who pay their taxes and help run our vital services, such as the NHS, are already leaving our shores is a tragedy.They have not only contributed to our economy, but also to our society. They are our neighbours, our work colleagues and our friends. If you are having trouble finding a job, getting a house, or seeing your doctor, it’s not caused by your Polish next door neighbours, it’s caused by the Tories’ austerity ideology.That my own party also wants to end freedom of movement is deeply distressing for me.We should be shouting from the rooftops about the unions of people and nations, and how we can use their collective power for the common good. That’s at the very heart of what it means – or what it should mean – to be Labour.But I worry too about the impact of Brexit on British citizens who have enjoyed the freedom to travel across the EU unhindered. The youngsters who have been offered the opportunity to fall in love with European cities, European culture and European people.The Brits who have made their homes in France, Spain and Ireland, often to enjoy a well-deserved retirement, or the students who have taken advantage of the Erasmus programme to broaden their horizons.As a young woman myself, aged just , in  I became the UK’s youngest MEP.I have witnessed major EU reforms that have transformed our lives, such as lower credit card fees, clearer labelling on food products and the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges.I have used my voice as a representative of voters in Scotland to help build a fairer society.So yes, I am angry that we are putting further development at risk. But, when the clock strikes pm on  March, it will largely be sadness that I feel.Sadness for those who will miss out on the opportunities we have today sadness for my friends across Europe and sadness that we are led by politicians who are willing to tear apart the bonds of solidarity that mean so much to so many people.Catherine Stihler is Labour MEP for Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849531.1546007236!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan 2019 predictions likely to be less crazy than reality","story":"No-one knows what will happen next year, so guess away # the truth is likely to be stranger than fiction, says John McLellanFilling newspapers at Twixtmas, as we must now refer to the week separating Christmas and New Year, is a pain all those reviews of last year and wild predictions for the one to come because nothing’s happening.At HQ the holiday cover just wants something, anything to fill the space. And early, please. The trade secret is what is known in politics as the Christmas Box a folio of previously prepared stories from press teams under day-by-day embargo drip-fed to tide the papers over until proper news starts happening again.Without Christmas Boxes, the news agenda would just be a diet of the day’s emergencies, the aftermath of drunken violence and the Old Firm. A bit like BBC Scotland every weekend.This year it’s much, much easier. No-one, not the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the First Minister, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch of Constantinople or Richard Dawkins has any idea what’s going to happen in British or European politics next week, never mind next year, so commentators can speculate away in the knowledge that reality will be crazier than any guess.My punt is the Prime Minister’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement for leaving the EU will win the day but onlyshe follows the advice to narrow down the options. There is no parliamentary majority for any of the possible pathways and despite talk of Norway or Canada Plus, it might as well be Norwegian Wood or Canada Dry for all the attention the EU is paying. The options come down to a second in-or-out referendum, the draft deal or a no-deal departure.As the government is committed to the meaningful vote by  January, the first move onfrom recess a week on Monday should be to force a vote over a second referendum. With Jeremy Corbyn committed to Brexit it’s a vote the government should win, which would leave the draft withdrawal and a no deal departure which the majority also oppose. Game, set and match, Mrs May.But having gambled with General Election odds in her favour and lost heavily, will Mrs May gamble again  With advice from the level-headed David Liddington, I’m not betting against it. VA envyEnterprising iniduals can make their own headlines, as Edinburgh Labour leader Cammy Day has done with his views on the Dundee VA and how Edinburgh should be following suit. What caught the eye, on Tayside certainly, was Cllr Day’s rejoinder that “ bloody Dundee can get a VA, then the capital city wants something even better”. Somewhat more diplomatically, bloody Dundee councillor Lynne Short responded calmly: “It is goodwe are inspiring other towns and cities.”Happily, now working on what could be Edinburgh’s answer to the VA is award-winning Scottish architect John McAslan whose catalogue of major international works includes London King’s Cross Station. Typically in his game there has been the odd political scuffle, most notably his shelved plans for Glasgow’s George Square.His practice has been working on the £m Granton collections centre for the National Galleries of Scotland and ever-helpful Cllr Day chipped in: “What we don’t want is a big storage container. We want a VA, we want something that’s quite iconic. If that’s not what’s coming forward then we are not interested.” “Quite iconic  How quite iconic would you like it, sir,” might not be Mr McAslan’s immediate reaction, but the point about a focal point for the new district is reasonable. I could hardly argue, given I made the same point in June after a sneak preview of the VA. “Siting anything like the VA in or around Edinburgh city centre would cause uproar, but put it on the seafront in Granton and it might have a similar effect as it’s having in Dundee,” I wrote. The problem with iconic, as the saga of the ten-times-over-budget £m Scottish Parliament building demonstrated, is cost. The Dundee VA is only about the same size as the Holyrood debating chamber alone and from £m ended up costing just over £m. Not quite iconicIconic is not a word often used to describe Meadowbank Stadium. Controversial or crumbling certainly, historic to an extent but symbolic not so much, not in architectural terms anyway.But the ious schemes to replace the Commonwealth Games complex have come to symbolise bitter cynicism about local decision-makingand a deep disenchantment with Edinburgh Council.For all its shortcomings, the stadium gave the district a sense of identity which the new sports centre will struggle to match.A new animated ‘fly-through’ of the replacement centre has just been released by the council, revealing a perfectly al regional sports centre, but to borrow from Cllr Day, it’s not quite iconic. Maybe the reality will be more impressive, but it doesn’t look like much for £m, certainly not the underwhelming -seat spectator area which is supposed to be a new home for Third Division high-flyers Edinburgh City.There is no sound business case for the council to build and maintain an international athletics stadium which would be needed about once every two years. If a millionaire track and field fan came forward then maybe it could be dferent, but the last time a supposed tycoon flashed his wallet around Meadowbank it didn’t end well. But the new images will do little to quell the feeling the area has been short-changed.Progress prediction nilNew Meadowbank is due to open in  and approximately  months later voters get a chance to pass judgment on their councillors at the  local elections. So in the spirit of all those Twixtmas space-fillers, here are a few predictions for Scotland’s capital in  after ten years of SNP-Labour coalitions: the Newhaven tram completion will not have taken its first fare-paying customer, the huge new Granton estate will not have risen from the old gasworks site, the South Suburban rail line’s only service will still be freight and the airport International Business Gateway will still be a field. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849875.1546106838!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm no time like the present to turn over a new leaf","story":"Looking back at the series of bloody car crashes that have constituted the last year in politics, the only positive I can come up with is that  is very nearly over.Whether it was the cruel dishonesty of US President Donald Trump, the ineffectual floundering of Prime Minister Theresa May, or the appalling rise of anti-Semitism in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party, the past  months had something for every kind of masochist.And there’s little to suggest that  is going to be much better.

And wouldn’t it be rather fun, too I have suggestions for opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, too.As  looms, Jeremy, why don’t you resolve to check who it is you’re associating with and supporting  Of course, you’ve been really unlucky over the past few decades, often appearing in public with racists and anti-Semites, but next year you can be the change your party needs.When you’re asked to endorse a candidate or appear on a  with an activist, ask yourself whether your endorsement is appropriate.If you cannot tell simply by looking whether you are about to offer your support to someone who believes Jews control the world through sinister networks, there’s a thing called Google you can use to find out more. Heaven knows, you’d have saved yourself a great deal of time and trouble in the past by carrying out the most cursory of checks on the people you associate with.Jez, whenever it turns out that you’ve been unlucky enough to hang about with anti-Semites or take money from Iran’s Press TV – the mouthpiece of a brutal regime – you’re quick to tell us that you oppose racism in all its forms. I say  should be the year that you stop opposing internet search engines in all their forms and find out a little about the people you consider fellow travellers.But it is not just leaders at Westminster who should resolve to do things dferently in the year ahead. I have some advice for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon too.Back in , you told us that the independence referendum was a once in a letime event. You resolved, after defeat in that vote, to bring the country back together. You’ve not really done that, have you, First Minister Instead, you’ve sought to turn every political twist and turn into an argument in favour of a second referendum. It doesn’t matter what the polls have told you, you’ve insisted that support for independence is growing.So why don’t you resolve, in , to stop this nonsensical game and get on with using the powers at your disposal to change Scotland for the better Why don’t you, First Minister, make next year the one where you began listening to the majority of Scots A new year with a new politics of honesty sounds pretty good to me.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4849970.1546175147!/image/image.jpg","title":"liam fox claims whisky industry could be boosted post brexit","story":"Exports of Scotch whisky could be boostedthe UK joins a trans-Pacic trade agreement after Brexit, according to International Trade Secretary Liam Fox.The Trans-Pacic Partnership , which comes into force on Sunday, will eliminate tarfs on % of goods traded between states once ratied by all members.The agreement covers  countries around the Pacic rim, including Australia, Canada and Japan, as well as fast-growing economies such as Malaysia and Vietnam.: Scotch Whisky association backs plansAccording to the Department for International Trade , UK Scotch whisky exports to CPTPP nations were worth £ million in - - an increase of .% on the previous year.Scotch whisky exports currently face tarf charges, such as % when exporting to Australia, which make them more expensive for consumers.CPTPP countries account for .% of Scotch whisky exports globally.The UK Government has suggested that joining the CPTPP would bring signicant savings for exporters and businesses and raise standards on human rights, labour practices and environmental standards across member states.DIT is in the process of analysing responses to a -week public consultation on potential accession to the trade bloc.Mr Fox said: “Total trade between the UK and CPTPP members was worth £ billion last year and the UK joining could help British businesses further establish a foothold in the Asia-Pacic region, which will be an engine of growth in the st century.“We are determined to deliver a free trade agenda that guarantees greater market access for existing UK exporters and helps more businesses, including SMEs, to capitalise on the opportunities that free trade brings.“The Scotch whisky industry supports more than , jobs across the UK, , of them in rural areas, providing vital employment and investment.“In , £ worth of whisky was exported every second and there is great potential to increase this in the future after we leave the European Union.”Martin Bell, of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: “The Scotch whisky industry is a strong supporter of open markets and trade liberalisation.“CPTPP is a st century trade agreement which balances ambitious market access commitments and state-of-the-art rules with appropriate space for regulators to pursue legitimate domestic policy goals.“The agreement already encompasses many important and growing markets for Scotch whisky in a high-growth region.

The head was not larger than that of a seal, and was furnished with two blow-holes. From the back a number of filamentshang down like a mane. On each side of the body were three large fins, shaped like paws, and jointed.”One needs only to read that to note the striking similarity with the Loch Ness Monster.: Edinburgh scientists identy new prehistoric sea monsterUnfortunately, by the time the experts arrived on the scene, what remained of the beast had decayed to the point that it was dficult to determinethis was the real deal.Bits of the carcass, which included vertebrae segments and strands of hair, were transported to Edinburgh - then one of the most important scientic centres in the Western World - where they were poked, prodded and pondered over by members of the Wernerian Society. Nobody could figure out the mystery, but so convinced were the great minds of the time that this was a newly-discovered species, the beast was given its own scientic name: “Halsydrus Pontoppidani”, after a Norwegian bishop who recorded sea monsters in the s. Even Nessie doesn’t boast her own proper moniker.However, the mystery was short-lived. : German U-boat abandoned due to ‘sea monster’Esteemed surgeon Sir Everard Home brought the beast’s skull and neck bones with him to London, bursting the bubble in the process. Upon closer inspection of the vertebrae, Sir Everard concluded it was the scant remains of a humble basking shark.Basking sharks are not uncommon in the North Sea, particularly during the summer months. They are seen in even greater numbers in the North Atlantic and will occasionally venture close to the west coast of Scotland.Home’s findings were given further credence in the s by Dr Geoff Swinney, an expert on lower vertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles, who asserted that it was  per cent certain that it was a basking shark.And, with that analysis, the Stronsay Beast was dead.A specimen of the ‘sea serpent’s’ vertebrae is kept by the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street in Edinburgh.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Aimee-Fewell-4-Auchtertyre-primry.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745500.1545401332!/image/image.jpg","title":"galgorm resort and spa evacuated","story":"Galgorm Resort and Spa has ed to business as usual after an evacuation earlier this afternoon.The hotel was evactuated as a precaution following a small electrical fire, which had been dealt with by staff by the time the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service had arrived at the scene, a fire service spokesperson said.Galgorm Resort and Spa.Victoria Brown, marketing manager at Galgorm Resort and Spa, said: “As a precautionary measure we evactuated the resort this afternoon following an incident whereby smoke was seen coming from a ceiling .

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

State papers: Claims of shoot-to-kill policy by the RUC at the height of Troubles had ‘grave implications’ for Garda co-operation, said Dublin Justice Minister The two soldiers were surrounded by the crowd when they joined the funeral cortege of Caoimhin Mac Bradaigh, an IRA man killed in Milltown Cemetery by the loyalist Michael Stone while attending the funerals of the three IRA members shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar.The double killings provoked outrage among MPs at Westminster. A memo written by an Irish Government official following a debate in the House of Commons about the murders said that Mr Kilfedder raised the possibility of a Church excommunication of IRA terrorists, which \"might in consequence reduce their funerals to very modest affairs\".Moments before the two corporals were dragged from their car Wood drew his pistol and fired a warning into the air, but it did not deter the crowd from surrounding the vehicle.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decidethe final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum or so-called People’s Vote.However he said he was “working on the assumption thatwill leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Government cannot renege on Brexit Dr Fox told the Sunday Times that Brexit will only be “% certain”the House of Commons backs the Prime Minister’s deal in a crunch vote next month.The International Trade Secretary warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May’s deal would be “incendiary” and said it was “a matter of honour” for them to support the PM.Having given the public the right to decide on EU membership in a referendum, “Parliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on that result”, said Dr Fox.“Were they to do so, I think you would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament. And I think that would put us into unprecedented territory with unknowable consequences.”Campaigners for a second EU referendum seized on the International Trade Secretary’s comments, saying that polls suggested that fewer than % of Britons now want to leave the EU.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a referendum, said: “Brexit not happening isn’t - as Liam Fox says. It’s actually -.”The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choiceDavid DavisFacebookTwitterFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis said he expected defeat for Mrs May’s plan in the Commons to force the UK and EU back to the negotiating table to strike a new deal before March .Mr Davis told LBC radio: “They will have to come back and deal again. The deal she’s got is no good.“It will be very, very nerve-wracking for some people and some companies, but at the end of the day we will get a deal and it will be a better one than she has got. That’s where I think it will go and that’s what I think she should do.”Mr Davis dismissed ministers’ warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit as “scare stories”.“The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choice,” he said.“They are saying to the ones who want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you won’t get Brexit’ and to those who don’t want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you will have the worst sort of Brexit, you will have a hard crash-out’. Both these stories can’t be right.“They are trying to run the clock down. I don’t think it’s a wise strategy.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Government had put Britain into a “ridiculous” position.He tweeted: “Combination of  Brexit promises and useless Government. No deal has never been viable and, as every day passes, it becomes less so.”But the Scottish National Party’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, retorted: “The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green Party are all working together to try and get a People’s Vote. Why don’t Labour work with us and others on the Government benches to stop this madness “Labour will not be forgiven for standing aside. You can call me anytime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"state papers let them get on with butchering each other mps demanded withdrawal from ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"watch baseball star stuns parents by paying off their debts for christmas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Also, I paid off all your debt as well.“Now, instead of trying to save money every weekend to replace the savings account you drained on travelling to see me play baseball you can spend it on yourselves.”It concludes: “Because you deserve the very best I want you both to know how much I appreciate you and how none of this would be possible without you.“Your giving hearts helped to shape my tiny dream into a reality.

Christmas present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat.

Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong. Mr Watson, who is  and probably one of Killyleaghrsquos oldest residents, has been fighting a gruelling battle with the Housing Executive to obtain a house without stairs.At his Comber Road home Mr Watson and his  year-old we, Liza-Jane, have been tormented for a long time by problems which are easily overcome by the young, but cause massive complications for older citizens.The normally simple operation of climbing stairs is is a great task for Mrs Watson. Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy. The little foal was born two weeks ago and Gregory will now have twice as much to handle.ldquoHe has still not picked a proper name for the new addition.

Behind-the-scenes discussions are tang place in an attempt to end the monopoly of harbour facilities by the Strangford ferry and open up berths for smaller craft.Strangford, as a port of call for small boats, was virtually closed off several years ago with the expansion of the ferry service and ancillary facilities.The villagersquos past has always been linked with the harbour when an armada of small boats tied up at the harbour wall, particularly during the successful carnival days.DRUMNAQUOILE mdash Police are investigating the slaughter of three sheep and the injuring of ten others in the Drumnaquoile area.

Irish diplomat and relayed to Dublin in .The suggestion in Parliament by independent Unionist MP Jim Kilfedder came days after one of the most high-profile double killings when Army corporals Derek Wood and David Howes were beaten and shot dead by a mob after they inadvertently drove into an IRA funeral.The two soldiers were surrounded by the crowd when they drove into the funeral cortege of Kevin Brady, an IRA man killed in Milltown Cemetery by the loyalist Michael Stone while attending the funerals of the three IRA members shot dead by the SAS at Gibraltar in March .A memo written by an Irish government official following a debate in the House of Commons about the murders has been declassied in Dublin.The official said that Mr Kilfedder raised the possibility of a church excommunication of IRA terrorists, which “might in consequence reduce their funerals to very modest affairs”.Moments before the two British corporals were dragged from their car, Mr Wood drew his pistol and fired a warning into the air, but it did not deter the crowd from surrounding the vehicle.Former DUP leader Peter Robinson suggested that the soldiers had refrained from opening fire because of fear of repercussions and asked the secretary of state to make clear that he would stand behind any members of the security forces who had to defend their lives in such circumstances.It also emerged from the state papers that the British joint secretary told an Irish government official there was a prospect of a public controversy “looming between the RUC and ITN and BBC” over RUC access to the television tapes of the killings.Broadcast networks that were covering the funeral refused to hand over the footage to the RUC, saying it would endanger the lives of journalists. “He said that ITN had agreed to give the RUC access while the BBC had refused,” he wrote.News coverage of the funeral later became central to the case and helped convict Harry Maguire and Alex Murphy, who were both jailed for the  attack.Relationships between PSNI and community in west Belfast have ‘deteriorated’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

coastlines are dotted with swimmers who go out no matter what the weather or temperature.Team Dash and Splash swimmers, some in fancy dress, after a swim in the Irish Sea at Bangor beach. Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireIt is a trend that is growing across the UK, with membership of the Outdoor Swimming Society up from  in  to , in .Cold water plunges are believed to have health benefits, including strengthening the nervous system.While some swimmers don wetsuits, a growing number of groups insist on “skins only”, ie swimming suits.The Donaghadee Chunky Dunkers in Co Down is one of the longest running groups in Northern Ireland. It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up.

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:ITALYVenice, November .Prince Pio, Ambassador from the Emperor, has proposed to borrow a large Sum of Money for his Imperial Majesty of this Republick upon the Customs of the Port of Trieste. To which Proposition the Senate has answered, that it was not agreeable to the State to grant a Loan upon those Customs but thathis Imperial Majesty would make the Republick an absolute Sale of this Port, they were ready to enter into Negotiation there upon. This Answer has been very well received at Vienna, because Trieste is now of no Advantage to the Emperor, the Commerce which was intended to have been established there in no Degree taking effect after the Abolition of the Ostend East India Company wherefore the Imperial Court concludes, that as Trieste brings in no real Profit to it, nor is ever likely to produce any its best Method will be to dispose of it for a Sum of ready Money. [His Imperial Majesty was Charles VI, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, covering much of what is now Germany, Italy and Austria]RUSSIA.Petersburg, Nov. .

Born in Germany, he became a brilliant military commander, ultimately for the Russians, leading them in their war against the Ottomans, which began in  and which the Austrians joined in . The Empress, also known as the Czarina, was Anna of Russia, who came to the throne in , five years after the death of Peter the Great, and held office until . Count Munich fell out of favour after the death of the empress and was at one point set to be executed, a sentence that was commuted to banishment in Siberia]LONDON, Nov. , , , .This Day  Yards of Linen were imported hither from Leith in Scotland and above  Quarters of Wheat were shipp’d off hence for foreign Parts.From the Hague, that every Thing seems to tend towards an Accommodation with Spain, on the following Conditions, viz. The restoring a Flag taken by the Dutch from on board a Spanish Ship the punishing corporally, at least fining of the Persons concerned in that and other Insults and the rigorous Prohibition of all clandestine Trade for the Future.Declassied papers: IRA concerns at Gerry Adams’ leadershipEuropean pilgrimage route for Irish saint in bid for special status Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"[There was tension between Spain and other trading nations, including a  incident when aSpanish commander boarded a British boat and cut off the captain’s ear.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join. There are no auditions and no previous choir experience is needed.The concert saw many people turn up to enjoy the music alongside a iety of refreshments.Dafydd Jones, administrator of the Parish of All Saints Church and organiser of the Music at Lunchtime programme of concerts, said the concert was a great way to start the season.He said: \"An enjoyable time was had by all - audience and performers who have, by the way, expressed a willingness, nay an enthusiasm, to come back for amatch next year.\"After welcoming the audience and thanking them for their attendance, I introduced the Town Mayor, Cllr Jon Luxton who spoke briefly about Music at Lunchtime, the Barry Community Choir and All Saints Church also expressed a desire to come back for other concerts in the future.\"The choir performed a most enjoyable pot-pourri of songs from the shows amongst many others and ended up with a foot-tapping medley of World War One favourites.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decidethe final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum or so-called Peoplersquos Vote.However he said he was ldquoworking on the assumption thatwill leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided.ldquoI have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May, Mr Juncker added.ldquoIt is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Government cannot renege on Brexit Dr Fox told the Sunday Times that Brexit will only be ldquo% certainthe House of Commons backs the Prime Ministerrsquos deal in a crunch vote next month.The International Trade Secretary warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs Mayrsquos deal would be ldquoincendiary and said it was ldquoa matter of honour for them to support the PM.Having given the public the right to decide on EU membership in a referendum, ldquoParliament cannot now, with any honour, renege on that result, said Dr Fox.ldquoWere they to do so, I think you would shatter the bond of trust between the electorate and Parliament. And I think that would put us into unprecedented territory with unknowable consequences.Campaigners for a second EU referendum seized on the International Trade Secretaryrsquos comments, saying that polls suggested that fewer than % of Britons now want to leave the EU.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a referendum, said: ldquoBrexit not happening isnrsquot - as Liam Fox says. Itrsquos actually -.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said he expected defeat for Mrs Mayrsquos plan in the Commons to force the UK and EU back to the negotiating table to strike a new deal before March .Mr Davis told LBC radio: ldquoThey will have to come back and deal again. The deal shersquos got is no good.ldquoIt will be very, very nerve-wracking for some people and some companies, but at the end of the day we will get a deal and it will be a better one than she has got. Thatrsquos where I think it will go and thatrsquos what I think she should do.Mr Davis dismissed ministersrsquo warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit as ldquoscare stories.ldquoThe Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choice, he said.ldquoThey are saying to the ones who want Brexit lsquoIf you donrsquot vote for this you wonrsquot get Brexitrsquo and to those who donrsquot want Brexit lsquoIf you donrsquot vote for this you will have the worst sort of Brexit, you will have a hard crash-outrsquo. Both these stories canrsquot be right.ldquoThey are trying to run the clock down. I donrsquot think itrsquos a wise strategy.Labourrsquos shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the Government had put Britain into a ldquoridiculous position.He tweeted: ldquoCombination of  Brexit promises and useless Government. No deal has never been viable and, as every day passes, it becomes less so.But the Scottish National Partyrsquos leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, retorted: ldquoThe SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green Party are all working together to try and get a Peoplersquos Vote. Why donrsquot Labour work with us and others on the Government benches to stop this madness ldquoLabour will not be forgiven for standing aside.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
