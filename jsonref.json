AMLO was then a member of the PRI party, led by President Enrique Pena Nieto, but quit in the late 1980s.After losing the Tabasco governor’s race twice, he staged protests in an attempt to raise his profile during a time in which there was increasing resistance towards the leading party. However, in 2000, AMLO was elected as the mayor of Mexico City as part of the PRD.With his first bid at the presidency in 2006, he promised to ‘put the poor first’, but his critics branded him ‘a danger for Mexico’, likening him to Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez. The election was decided by a thin margin and López Obrador claimed it had been rigged.          Mexico City\u0027s main square, the Zocalo, as Andrés Manuel López Obrador delivers his speechAMLO led protests yet again and declared that he was the legitimate president of Mexico. This led to the former Mayor speaking in villages that had not been visited by political leaders for years.One of his aides, Polimnia Romana Sierra said: ‘He spoke with the same energy under a tree in front of 10 people as he did in the full Zocalo. Nobody works the microphone like him.’He formed a new party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and by 2015, he was regarded as the next election winner. In addition to this, as the PRI became increasingly involved in corruption scandals, López Obrador also grew in popularity.His wife and fervent feminist, Beatriz Gutierrez, also helped to extend his appeal to female voters in Mexico.          AMLO, accompanied by wife Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, delivers his victory speech in MexicoAndrés Manuel López Obrador\u0027s policiesAfter winning the Mexican election, Andrés Manuel López Obrador must now ensure that his promises are fulfilled. Despite critics comparing AMLO to Hugo Chavez and his leftist sympathies could turn Mexico into Venezuela, he took home a landslide victory.According to the BBC, many believe that he shares an authoritarian approach and will ruin the economy, but AMLO has rejected these claims and has said that he will not carry out expropriations and will not seek re-election.However, he has promised to renew contracts awarded by the state oil company Pemex to private companies during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto and will check they are not corrupt. He has also vowed to bring economic growth, jobs and social development programmes.‘We will carry out a peaceful transformation, ordered, but profound and even radical, because the word radical comes from root, and what we will do... is, in essence, to root out the corrupt regime,’ he said at one campaign rally.Against what he describes as the ‘power mafia’ of Mexico, he plans to increase scholarships for the young and expand welfare for the elderly, offering ‘good relations’ with the private sector and accusing business leaders of acting ‘like they owned Mexico’.AMLO has also promised to bring peace to the war on drugs, but will not continue the military-led strategy. Notably, he has also said that he would not let Mexico bow down to Trump and asked for ‘friendship’ and ‘mutual respect’ to avoid any trade war.\u0027Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States it\u0027s a human right we will defend,\u0027 Lopez Obrador said in a June speech reported by El Universal.US President Donald Trump congratulated Lopez Obrador in a tweet saying: \u0027Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico.

is expected to heap pressure on NATO members to spend more at what could be a bad-tempered summit next week          In a letter to his British counterpart, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis (pictured)

forcesDonald Trump is expected to heap pressure on NATO members to spend more at what could be a bad-tempered summit next week.  In the missive, seen by The Sun, General Mattis told Mr Williamson that Washington is \u0027concerned\u0027 the UK\u0027s forces and diplomatic influence are \u0027at risk of erosion\u0027.He said he wanted Britain to remain America\u0027s \u0027partner of choice\u0027 - but added that the French were committed to being \u0027global actors\u0027 alongside the US. Mr Trump will travel to Europe next week for a potentially stormy NATO gathering on July 11-12, before heading to the UK.In the two-page letter, Gen Mattis said \u0027the credibility of the UK\u0027s armed forces\u0027 had been crucial in securing its place on the world stage.David Cameron DID ask

provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change.\u0027The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money.Gen Mattis said: \u0027A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.\u0027Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.\u0027Highlighting Mr Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra £260billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: \u0027As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence.\u0027Other allies are following suit.\u0027          The letter has been leaked as Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured left with Mrs May and her husband Philip at an Armed Forces Day event over the weekend) lobbies hard for his budget to be expanded    Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured together at the White House in April) have struck up a close rapportHe stressed that it was \u0027in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice\u0027 but \u0027in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability\u0027.In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: \u0027It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.\u0027Downing Street tried to play down the row, insisting Britain has the \u0027biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato\u0027.‘I would point to the Nato Secretary General following his meeting with the PM where he said he appreciates Britain’s commitment and leadership in the Alliance,\u0027 the PM\u0027s spokesman said.‘The UK is above the 2 per cent contribution and we have said we will continue to meet that target.‘We, the US and France are close allies and partners willing to take action together in defence of our values.’However, the spokesman refused to state that the UK would continue to have the largest defence budget in Europe.   The week after receiving the letter, Mr Williamson told MPs that US patience over European defence spending was wearing thin.\u0027We can\u0027t continue to expect US taxpayers to keep picking up the tab for European defence indefinitely, nor can we expect US patience to last forever,\u0027 he said on June 20.The Commons Defence Committee has also called for a significant funding boost, moving the level of defence spending up from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of total GDP.A cash injection on this scale would equate to additional funding of around £20billion a year and bring investment in defence to levels similar to those seen between the end of the Cold War and the mid-1990s."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/13/4DD6ABFA00000578-5909173-The_27_year_old_princess_a_relative_of_Emperor_Akihito_will_marr-m-3_1530533285778.jpg","title":"Pictured

When he outgrew that and was being sent for slaughter, Manor Farm stepped in. ‘He’s a rascal,’ says Di. ‘Having been given lots of attention, he feels it’s his right to demand fuss from visitors, who are taken by surprise when he head-butts the back of their knees!’          Bullied pig called Simon: Partially-sighted and with deformed front legs, Simon was so terribly bullied by the bigger pigs he shared a sty with at another rescue centre that they asked Manor Farm to take him. ‘He was grossly overweight which didn’t help with his movement problems — if he was a human it’s like he’s walking on his wrists,’ says Di. ‘He’s now lost weight and is enjoying life with his friend Brooke. She chivvies him around all day and I give him strawberries and melon which he loves.’          Jack the VERY stroppy Donkey: Jack was the first non-hen to be taken in by Manor Farm rescue sanctuary after it came into being about seven years ago. ‘We bought the land for it with some money left to me by my Uncle Jack,’ says Di, ‘so when a donkey sanctuary asked me to look after a donkey called Jack it seemed meant to be. The only thing is — he’s nothing like my Uncle Jack who was very gentle whereas donkey Jack is quite stroppy!’Less than a decade ago, Di and Alan were both running businesses from their Nottinghamshire village home.Now they’re also running an animal sanctuary that currently cares for more than 100 farmyard creatures. And not just any creatures. They take in the ones no one else wanted, rejected because they were disabled, had health problems, special needs or simply grew too old.Or, in the case of the many rescued from petting zoos, simply because they grew up. ‘People imagine these animals are living a lovely life in the petting zoo until they die naturally,’ says Di, ‘but that’s not so in the majority of cases.Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...Share this article‘Lambs can be bred out of season to be Christmas attractions to be bottle-fed by visitors but once they’ve grown out of the cute stage, they go into the food chain.’What’s more, they often come to her emaciated, neglected and infested with parasites. Then the battle is on to save their lives. That battle costs Manor Farm Charitable Trust up to £100,000 a year — around a fifth of which are vets’ bills.‘Our vets are constantly challenged by the ageing of our animals,’ Di admits.No wonder — it’s rare farmyard creatures live more than a year or two before going to be slaughtered.          Blind Stevie\u0027s a littler wonder: When blind Stevie the Mallard duck came to Manor Farm, they knew he needed a friend to guide him round. ‘I chose a girl called Wanda,’ says Di, ‘because female ducks are louder than the boys and I believed he needed someone noisy to follow around.’ Stevie was found with big scabs over his eyes. ‘We didn’t know at first if he’d been attacked, if they were infected or even if he had eyes. He did — but he was blind.’ Now Wanda’s his guide duck.          Toothless OAP fed on a banana: Life’s left Dolly so scared of human strangers that when summer comes Di can’t call in a shearer —instead she has to do it herself with nail scissors. Dolly, a breeding nanny at a farm park, came to Manor Farm in 2012 when they started neglecting her because she’d become barren. ‘She barely had the strength to hold her head up,’ says Di. ‘But she had an indomitable spirit we could all do with.’ Dolly, who has no teeth, was fattened up with mashed banana and is now in the equivalent of her 90s.          Stumble, duck who live up to his name: Stumble may only have one leg but he’s still the scourge of the female ducks he shares his enclosure with. ‘He’s perfected the ability to jump on to a mate,’ says Di. ‘They all run but they can’t hide from him. Stumble’s leg had to be amputated after getting caught in fishing wire. He’s had a difficult summer because he’s moulted and lost his tail feather and wing tips — which help keep him stable. So he keeps falling over.’ And falling in love.          Goat that costs £3,000 to perk up: Of all the Manor Farm animals, Jo cost the most. So thin when Di rescued him from a petting zoo that he couldn’t hold his neck up, she nursed him back to health in her kitchen. ‘He came up to me as if to say “help me,” ’ she says. Jo was covered in lice and had digestive problems. ‘We nearly lost him several times — he was always the one needing the vet at midnight,’ says Di. But she doesn’t begrudge a penny of the £3,000 he cost. ‘He’s the sweetest creature,’ she says.But it’s not just the vets who have been learning. Di has too. ‘In 2010 I treated myself to four hens as a reward for completing an MA in creative writing and I found it was a slippery slope ,’ she says.A year later, a relative died, leaving her money to buy the six-acre field behind the house. Slowly the brood grew and the dozen or so enclosures now house 64 hens, 27 goats, two donkeys, one pony, two pigs and 30 sheep.Di now employs a full-time member of staff and three part-timers. Every day begins at 6am when she gets the feed ready. It ends at 10.30pm — earlier in winter — when she puts the animals to bed. She also finds time to run her publishing business (and Alan his marketing consultancy firm) which help bankroll Manor Farm.          Ewe with a stiff neck: Born with a twisted neck, Hilda was too deformed to breed and too skinny to slaughter so Di took the tiny ewe in. \u0027We were told she\u0027d never take to humans,\u0027 she eat out of a trough because she\u0027d never seen them before. But within a month she was letting us touch her and gradually she got a lust for life. Now she loves to be cuddled and her tail wags madly like a big dog          A goat the size of a pony: Ronnie, the Anglo Nubian goat, is the size of a Shetland pony. ‘They’re a large breed but he’s a particular giant,’ says Di, ‘and that’s how he ended up here — his elderly owner couldn’t cope with the size of him and was going to have him shot.’ So she did a 135-mile round trip to save him. ‘I knew he was big but even so it was a bit of a shock when I saw him.’Other money comes from corporate and personal donations and the sale of eggs and wool from the animals online. Apart from cash worries, there are other downsides. ‘I’ve had every injury known to man — I’ve lost a nail to a goat horn, been electrocuted by a fence and accidentally injected myself with goat antibiotics,’ says Di.But this pales into insignificance compared to the pain of losing one of their beloved creatures. The sanctuary is full so it’s only with the death of an animal that another can be saved. They come from farm parks, via social media or from other rescue centres.‘It is hard work,’ says Di, ‘but when you see the sheep feeding on the grass and the goats happy in their enclosure, it’s worth it.’          Hen healed in a roasting tray: Buffy the ex-battery hen was doing perfectly well at Manor Farm when she was sat on by another bird and left with a bruised back last winter. ‘One of my biggest joys was that we got Buffy back to health with daily physio,’ says Di. ‘Although I do feel a bit guilty that we kept her in a roasting tray so she could rest her neck on the edge of it. She’s still a bit stiff and walks with a bit of a goose step but is otherwise fine. And she now loves cuddles — every time you pass her she wants you to pick her up.’          Sheep who need a dentist: Dumpy is easy to spot: his teeth have grown so big, his jaw is deformed. ‘But you really couldn’t meet a sweeter sheep,’ says Di. She saved him from the slaughterhouse last year — he was on a trailer bound for it when the farmer’s daughter put out a social media appeal. ‘We all clubbed together to buy him and the farmer said we could have him — as long as we gave the money to Comic Relief,’ says Di. But those teeth keep the dentist busy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/22/4DDC2F2D00000578-0-image-a-101_1530567895840.jpg","title":"Man bit tail rattlesnake tossed neighbors RV argument","story":"    Ryan Felton Sauter, 39, of Dale, Texas, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass and deadly conduct after allegedly biting the tail off a rattlesnake and putting the snake in his neighbor\u0027s RVA Texas man was arrested after allegedly biting the tail off a rattlesnake and putting it in his neighbor\u0027s RV following an argument between the two men. Ryan Felton Sauter, 39, of Dale, Texas, was arrested and charged with Class A misdemeanor criminal trespass of a habitation and deadly conduct following the incident which occurred on June 17.After an argument with his neighbor, Keith Monroe, Sauter allegedly found a rattlesnake and used his own teeth to bite its tail off, so the snake could not be heard when it attacked.Sauter is accused of then putting the maimed rattlesnake inside Monroe\u0027s RV.Monroe told the Austin-American Statesman he saw Sauter leave his RV and asked him why he was in his home without his permission. According to Monroe, Sauter said, \u0027You\u0027ll see why.\u0027 In an effort to figure out what Sauter meant, Monroe said he went inside his home and, looking around, saw the three-foot-long rattlesnake.\u0027I freaked out,\u0027 Monroe told the Statesman. \u0027I couldn’t believe this happened.\u0027           Sauter\u0027s neighbor, Keith Monroe (pictured) said that he and Sauter had an argument prior to the snake incident and that they had long-standing disagreements over multiple issues          Monroe said that he saw Sauter exiting his RV (pictured) and when he asked why Sauter was inside without permission, Sauter said \u0027you\u0027ll see why\u0027           The snake Monroe found in his RV was three feet long.

When he outgrew that and was being sent for slaughter, Manor Farm stepped in. ‘He’s a rascal,’ says Di. ‘Having been given lots of attention, he feels it’s his right to demand fuss from visitors, who are taken by surprise when he head-butts the back of their knees!’          Bullied pig called Simon: Partially-sighted and with deformed front legs, Simon was so terribly bullied by the bigger pigs he shared a sty with at another rescue centre that they asked Manor Farm to take him. ‘He was grossly overweight which didn’t help with his movement problems — if he was a human it’s like he’s walking on his wrists,’ says Di. ‘He’s now lost weight and is enjoying life with his friend Brooke. She chivvies him around all day and I give him strawberries and melon which he loves.’          Jack the VERY stroppy Donkey: Jack was the first non-hen to be taken in by Manor Farm rescue sanctuary after it came into being about seven years ago. ‘We bought the land for it with some money left to me by my Uncle Jack,’ says Di, ‘so when a donkey sanctuary asked me to look after a donkey called Jack it seemed meant to be. The only thing is — he’s nothing like my Uncle Jack who was very gentle whereas donkey Jack is quite stroppy!’Less than a decade ago, Di and Alan were both running businesses from their Nottinghamshire village home.Now they’re also running an animal sanctuary that currently cares for more than 100 farmyard creatures. And not just any creatures. They take in the ones no one else wanted, rejected because they were disabled, had health problems, special needs or simply grew too old.Or, in the case of the many rescued from petting zoos, simply because they grew up. ‘People imagine these animals are living a lovely life in the petting zoo until they die naturally,’ says Di, ‘but that’s not so in the majority of cases.Adorable moment Limbani the chimpanzee shrieks with joy and...Fury at female Kentucky hunter who posted sickening photos...Share this article‘Lambs can be bred out of season to be Christmas attractions to be bottle-fed by visitors but once they’ve grown out of the cute stage, they go into the food chain.’What’s more, they often come to her emaciated, neglected and infested with parasites. Then the battle is on to save their lives. That battle costs Manor Farm Charitable Trust up to £100,000 a year — around a fifth of which are vets’ bills.‘Our vets are constantly challenged by the ageing of our animals,’ Di admits.No wonder — it’s rare farmyard creatures live more than a year or two before going to be slaughtered.          Blind Stevie\u0027s a littler wonder: When blind Stevie the Mallard duck came to Manor Farm, they knew he needed a friend to guide him round. ‘I chose a girl called Wanda,’ says Di, ‘because female ducks are louder than the boys and I believed he needed someone noisy to follow around.’ Stevie was found with big scabs over his eyes. ‘We didn’t know at first if he’d been attacked, if they were infected or even if he had eyes. He did — but he was blind.’ Now Wanda’s his guide duck.          Toothless OAP fed on a banana: Life’s left Dolly so scared of human strangers that when summer comes Di can’t call in a shearer —instead she has to do it herself with nail scissors. Dolly, a breeding nanny at a farm park, came to Manor Farm in 2012 when they started neglecting her because she’d become barren. ‘She barely had the strength to hold her head up,’ says Di. ‘But she had an indomitable spirit we could all do with.’ Dolly, who has no teeth, was fattened up with mashed banana and is now in the equivalent of her 90s.          Stumble, duck who live up to his name: Stumble may only have one leg but he’s still the scourge of the female ducks he shares his enclosure with. ‘He’s perfected the ability to jump on to a mate,’ says Di. ‘They all run but they can’t hide from him. Stumble’s leg had to be amputated after getting caught in fishing wire. He’s had a difficult summer because he’s moulted and lost his tail feather and wing tips — which help keep him stable. So he keeps falling over.’ And falling in love.          Goat that costs £3,000 to perk up: Of all the Manor Farm animals, Jo cost the most. So thin when Di rescued him from a petting zoo that he couldn’t hold his neck up, she nursed him back to health in her kitchen. ‘He came up to me as if to say “help me,” ’ she says. Jo was covered in lice and had digestive problems. ‘We nearly lost him several times — he was always the one needing the vet at midnight,’ says Di. But she doesn’t begrudge a penny of the £3,000 he cost. ‘He’s the sweetest creature,’ she says.But it’s not just the vets who have been learning. Di has too. ‘In 2010 I treated myself to four hens as a reward for completing an MA in creative writing and I found it was a slippery slope ,’ she says.A year later, a relative died, leaving her money to buy the six-acre field behind the house. Slowly the brood grew and the dozen or so enclosures now house 64 hens, 27 goats, two donkeys, one pony, two pigs and 30 sheep.Di now employs a full-time member of staff and three part-timers. Every day begins at 6am when she gets the feed ready. It ends at 10.30pm — earlier in winter — when she puts the animals to bed. She also finds time to run her publishing business (and Alan his marketing consultancy firm) which help bankroll Manor Farm.          Ewe with a stiff neck: Born with a twisted neck, Hilda was too deformed to breed and too skinny to slaughter so Di took the tiny ewe in. \u0027We were told she\u0027d never take to humans,\u0027 she eat out of a trough because she\u0027d never seen them before. But within a month she was letting us touch her and gradually she got a lust for life. Now she loves to be cuddled and her tail wags madly like a big dog          A goat the size of a pony: Ronnie, the Anglo Nubian goat, is the size of a Shetland pony. ‘They’re a large breed but he’s a particular giant,’ says Di, ‘and that’s how he ended up here — his elderly owner couldn’t cope with the size of him and was going to have him shot.’ So she did a 135-mile round trip to save him. ‘I knew he was big but even so it was a bit of a shock when I saw him.’Other money comes from corporate and personal donations and the sale of eggs and wool from the animals online. Apart from cash worries, there are other downsides. ‘I’ve had every injury known to man — I’ve lost a nail to a goat horn, been electrocuted by a fence and accidentally injected myself with goat antibiotics,’ says Di.But this pales into insignificance compared to the pain of losing one of their beloved creatures. The sanctuary is full so it’s only with the death of an animal that another can be saved. They come from farm parks, via social media or from other rescue centres.‘It is hard work,’ says Di, ‘but when you see the sheep feeding on the grass and the goats happy in their enclosure, it’s worth it.’          Hen healed in a roasting tray: Buffy the ex-battery hen was doing perfectly well at Manor Farm when she was sat on by another bird and left with a bruised back last winter. ‘One of my biggest joys was that we got Buffy back to health with daily physio,’ says Di. ‘Although I do feel a bit guilty that we kept her in a roasting tray so she could rest her neck on the edge of it. She’s still a bit stiff and walks with a bit of a goose step but is otherwise fine. And she now loves cuddles — every time you pass her she wants you to pick her up.’          Sheep who need a dentist: Dumpy is easy to spot: his teeth have grown so big, his jaw is deformed. ‘But you really couldn’t meet a sweeter sheep,’ says Di. She saved him from the slaughterhouse last year — he was on a trailer bound for it when the farmer’s daughter put out a social media appeal. ‘We all clubbed together to buy him and the farmer said we could have him — as long as we gave the money to Comic Relief,’ says Di. But those teeth keep the dentist busy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/23/4DDC612900000578-0-image-m-43_1530569832386.jpg","title":"The gloriously British summer party","story":"    Anyone for tennis?

I’ve never tried it and there isn’t much peer-reviewed literature on the matter – but from what I know of the debate, Gwyneth Paltrow is in one corner, singing its praises for hormonal balance, and all of gynaecology is in the other, saying this is a stupid thing to do, the vagina is self-cleaning, has a delicately balanced environment of flora and bacteria, the hormones are generated in the fallopian tubes anyway, which are nowhere near any steam, and also, you might burn yourself.What a shame, therefore, to find it on the programme for the nation’s first women-only festival, scheduled this August in Somerset. As if they weren’t already going to be mocked enough: for the wild foraging and the workshops entitled “Shamanic Journey Into Unity Consciousness” for the headline act, TreeSisters for the basket-making and the DJ promising a set about sacred sexuality.And yet, steaming or no steaming, mockery in this instance is rendered speechless. The event simply outflanks any attempt to ridicule it. Which is when it dawned on me that they’ve done this on purpose: it is a world-class trolling event, purpose-built to give Rod Liddle and Richard Littlejohn aneurysms. Doubtless, when you get there, it will be sunshine and snakebite and the raw, lusty amusement of being everything your detractors say you are, and then some.There will be dissenting voices on the feminist side: in the quest for the universal acceptance of equality, wouldn’t it be better not to look so cranky? This ignores the one true property of chauvinism, that it is never satisfied. You can spend your life compromising and appeasing, moving closer to them accepting that steaming your vagina has no medical basis and that you probably are not able to communicate directly with a tree, that foraging is a self-indulgent hobby for people who could perfectly well afford wild lovage in a farmers’ market, and they’ll still want more. They won’t be happy until you accept “menstrual” as a dirty word and deride female company as, in essence, second-rate. And even if you roll over to all that, they’ll vote for Jacob Rees-Mogg anyway, and wham, you’ll lose your reproductive rights, thanks. A little pushback is well overdue.It is a useful parable for Angela Merkel, who woke up this morning in a fix: she has been rolling over to the demands of her interior minister – Horst Seehofer, leader of her partner party, the CSU – and his preferred immigration policy of Germany-for-the-Bavarians. Already, he has been accommodated to a degree that goes against what any reasonable leader would make of the refugee crisis: he wants Germany’s borders closed to anyone already registered in another EU country, and Merkel has introduced a slew of almost-measures – agreements with inidual nations to reduce this “secondary migration”.She has accepted the fundamentals of Seehofer’s argument, despite the fact that “You keep them, you’re where they landed” is a poor one. It is no way to equitably distribute displaced people it’s politics as a game of musical chairs, one that is rigged because some of the chairs are much closer to the sea. It demands, furthermore, an end to the open-border policy that is a cornerstone of European cooperation. And, inevitably, it wasn’t enough. Seehofer is still causing trouble. It would never have been enough. Compromise only emboldens the absolutist.In fairness to Merkel, she has striven to make the humanitarian case for refuge but, hitting obstacles, she has surrendered to the realpolitik she sees across Europe if someone hits you with nationalism, come back with some soft-nationalism. In Emmanuel Macron’s tougher stance against homeless migrants in Theresa May’s hostile environment everywhere the far right advances, you can see spurts of bitter cruelty, tossed like fresh meat into the cage of a lion that won’t be satisfied until it’s savaged the whole zebra.It’s not even a left-right issue: it’s hard-right versus everyone else. One side repudiates all humanitarian responsibilities, the other scrambles to negotiate which scraps of decency we’re allowed to keep. The mainstream moves myopically into a new reality of the right’s creation. Are we allowed some refugees if they’re women? If they’re children? If we see a picture of a dead one on a beach? If we promise to harass them and keep them in poverty once they arrive? If we let most drown, can we take the few that could swim? The values that underpin the principle of sanctuary, being enshrined in international law, are considered too obvious to restate. But without them, we are reduced to only such generosity as the other side will allow – which is, on current form, none.Fascism is on the march: from racism to misogyny, from the usual suspects (Hungary, Turkey) to previous beacons of social democracy – Denmark’s new “ghetto” laws are terrifying, the audacity as chilling as the ambition. It will not be sated. It can only be opposed: with tree wisdom and steam – which are really just forms of celebrating difference without shame – with fearlessness, with whatever you’ve got."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82845437d21d4f6b6ea1706b355fb6a03c093a37/0_264_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c2bd97feed9f43a64ceae5d0751cef","title":"lgbt dorms gay students safe sheffield university","story":"For teenagers, leaving the family home and moving to college for the first time can be one of the most anxiety-producing events of their young lives. They will be in a new environment not knowing a soul, and will have to figure out, many for the first time, how to feed themselves and do their own laundry. (Just throw it all in the washer on cold, kids, and it will turn out fine.) But there is a particular anxiety for LGBT youth headed off to college, many of whom might still be in the closet. There is the fear of ridicule and alienation from their peers, and of violence against them. To combat this, the University of Sheffield recently announced that in the next academic year it would provide accommodation for LGBT students that would serve as a “safe space for students to be themselves”. It has received 30 applications for the 12 rooms and vows to offer more designated spaces in the future.This led to an article in the Times saying the university had been “warned about ghettoising LGBT students”. It seems to forget that gay people for decades have chosen to live in “gaybourhoods” in large cities, not simply to be able to live as their authentic selves, but also to ensure their safety. For many LGBT people, a ghetto is exactly what they are looking for. There are some that even want the queer community to have an independent nation.Even so, these fears of segregation seem largely unfounded. By no means is it compulsory for students who identify with one of the colours of the LGBT rainbow to live in these rooms. The flats are near more traditional housing so students can mingle.In the Times, Simon Thompson, the director of Accommodation for Students, the UK’s largest university housing service, made it clear he did not approve of Sheffield’s plan nor a similar one at Georgetown University in Washington DC. “University is about opening your horizons and meeting people from different cultures, different backgrounds, different sexualities, everything,” he said. “It’s a disadvantage if people close themselves off and don’t socialise with straight people. It seems like madness to me.”On the contrary, the idea that college students, perhaps the most social humans on the planet, will only befriend those in their immediate vicinity is madness. Anyone who has a degree knows that, over four years, friends are made from among a wide swath of people, both inside and outside of one’s subject area and accommodation block. Thompson is right that college life should prepare kids for wider society beyond university. But the fledgling queers of this world need a place where they feel like they belong to gain the confidence needed to operate in the world at large. This living arrangement doesn’t hinder their ability to integrate, it optimises it.For many, the social aspect of university life is just as important as what one learns in classes. What straight critics of LGBT dorm life fail to realise is that this is something that gay young people, especially those from more rural or conservative areas, have dreamed about. They finally get the chances that all the other youngsters had in high school: to be around people just like them, with the same interests, to be able to flirt with and ask out those they fancy without the fear that their romantic yearnings will lead to exposure, bullying, or worse. This is especially true for trans students living as their confirmed gender for the first time.Heading off to college is hard enough. Let’s give LGBT young people the gift of only having to worry about the things that all college kids worry about, like figuring out the laundry. (For that, the same rules apply. Just stick it on cold.)• Brian Moylan is a pop culture writer who lives in New York"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6fd15e3eba12ef3d0253154aafe0258a96cb7ba/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83cf48c147fd2f2f291fb3b3983a2926","title":"mexico narco nightmare amnesty traffickers","story":"Mexico sees itself today on the brink of change. The new president, the silver-haired Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has a mandate to renew the country’s politics, awarded to him by a people exasperated with poverty, outrageous inequality and corruption in daily life, and pervasive, brutal violence.López Obrador’s accession follows the bloodiest 12 months in the bloodiest decade since the Mexican revolution. So what are his options in the wake of the catastrophic “war on drugs”, lost to the tune of up to 250,000 Mexican lives since December 2006, with another 30,000 people missing? Mexican society itself has become brutalised, beyond even the narco-bloodletting, and the crimes that blight daily life are committed with shocking levels of impunity.Something has to radically change, and it is hard to imagine why any young voter would have endorsed the heirs to serial failures by President Felipe Calderón of the National Action party. Calderón kicked the hornets’ nest in 2006, taking on the cartels and unleashing the bloodshed. His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, restored the Institutional Revolutionary party and continued the war, to no effect, along with an even more grotesque record of corruption within his government.Mexican citizens suffer a related, raw fear of contagious violence. Its roots might lie in narco-traffic but the carnage has now spread way beyond it. It’s a culture of violence that was previously contained but is now geographically ubiquitous. There now comes a five-month transition period before López Obrador’s inauguration – a potentially fearsome limbo, after which the new president must find an efficacy in confronting this violence where his predecessors have failed.Mexico’s is a war I saw at close range, while writing a book about the bloodbath between cartels and the state. Narco-cartels are corporations – astute and effective – and a clientelist system of government has cohabited with them for decades, in alliances and modes of conviviality that mutate as one generation and modus operandi of criminal syndicate bequeaths another.López Obrador may just continue the tradition, though he promises to break with two of its central propositions. One is a fusing of the army and police into a single national guard under presidential authority. For all the warnings of authoritarian “Chavismo”, this might have an effect on the insidious network that connects layers of police and military authority with various cartels. The other, more widely discussed, is an “amnesty” for drug traffickers. But to whom would this amnesty apply? If the incoming president plans a pardon for small-time operators, gang fighters who carve turf or sell on the expanding domestic market, he takes an interesting step towards the effective legalisation of some quarters of narco-traffic.Amnesty for crime at all levels will lead people to ask: where does amnesty end and impunity begin? Amnesty for organisations such as the Marxist Farc in Colombia is offered in exchange for disarmament there’s no sign of that from the Sinaloa cartel, Los Zetas or the rising Jalisco New Generation. Will the amnesty apply, for instance, to people such as the former governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte, with whom I had my own menacing encounter in 2012? He is now awaiting trial on organised crime and money-laundering charges.In Mexico – as in the international system that launders drug money – the line between legality and illegality is a lie cartels ersify well beyond drug money into oil, minerals, tourism and so on. Will the amnesty shrug in acceptance of this, and, if so, what is supposed to change?There is one major step López Obrador could take. The drug war can never be won in or by Mexico alone – the struggle against narco-traffic, its violence and profits must be global and entail an entire international rethink.Eight years ago, at the summit of American states in Cartagena, Colombia, the host, President Juan Manuel Santos, threw down the gauntlet to drug-consuming countries in Europe and North America, where refined noses snort lines acquired at the expense of horrendous bloodshed, and the profits are laundered by banks such as Wachovia and HSBC, also with effective impunity (although both paid substantial fines).Those countries, said Santos, must accept their co-responsibility for the violence that Colombia – and Mexico – suffer, and assume a role in combating it that begins at home, not with yet more war in the “producing” and “transit” countries. Europe and the US (even before Donald Trump) have resisted Santos’s plea, and his forthcoming replacement as Colombian president, Iván Duque, will propose nothing of the sort. López Obrador, if he has the wit and wisdom – which cannot be presumed – will resurrect Santos’s cause and speak for not just Mexico’s but Latin America’s impatience with this nightmare.Journalists report like vultures on Mexico’s ultra-violence and hyper-cruelty, but it is a country where most daily encounters are life-affirming, invariably delightful – with resourceful, kind and hospitable people a country deep and rich in history and culture. The dichotomy highlights something in Mexico worth liberating from the horrors.During his campaign, López Obrador has had the audacity to evoke past presidents José María Morelos, Benito Juárez and Francisco Madero, greater men than him for sure, but whom he claims to want to emulate. These presidents did advance the best in Mexico against the worst.If López Obrador wants to even doff a sombrero to that heritage, he cannot just have an “amnesty” in response to the failure of the war on drugs. He must start to uproot the violence with solid strategies – on education, women’s rights, alleviation of poverty, ending cronyism and impunity. If he is to succeed he must nurture Mexico’s resourceful creativity and rewrite the war on drugs as a political war on war itself.• Ed Vulliamy is author of Amexica: War Along the Borderline"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a5e931d9d2eb16a0ba797628c5e45874b8e73a/0_245_2200_1321/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bab01f655ea00ee7c1d88101e9eaf57f","title":"the guardian view on mexicos new president there is an alternative","story":"Why did Mexico fall so hard for the 64-year-old Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as Amlo? His landslide victory is down in part to his offer of hopeful renewal and in part down to a national urge to stand\u0026nbspup to Donald Trump’s noxious anti-Mexican bullying. But\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspLópez\u0026nbspObrador won largely because his opponents championed the technocratic, free-market approach that has dominated Mexico since the mid-1980s. That has conspicuously failed to deliver the promised growth to alleviate poverty. Meanwhile violence skyrocketed and corruption soaked the body politic.A self-styled leftwing outsider, Mr López Obrador is no newcomer to politics. He won his country’s presidency after two failed attempts. Winning may have been the easy part. Governing, as Mr López Obrador knows from his stint as mayor of Mexico City, is harder. Although the presidency is a powerful post, his new party is unlikely to win a two-thirds majority in Mexico’s Congress, which is the threshold for big constitutional reforms. On the campaign trail Mr López Obrador promised to sell the presidential planes, turn the presidential palace into a public park and to halve his salary. But he also ran on a surprisingly sober business agenda overlaid with flashes of economic nationalism.In his victory speech Mr López Obrador sensibly signalled a shift away from the militarised response to drug cartels that has palpably failed. The question he has yet to answer is how to enforce the rule of law in a\u0026nbspcountry where murders have reached the level of an armed conflict. On the economy, the new president has made it clear that he views Mr Trump’s Nafta negotiations as an opportunity rather than a calamity. Given its natural resources, it is remarkable that Mexico imports so much US food produce.Mr López Obrador wants to be food independent but has yet to explain how this would be achieved. Mexico is a young democracy run until 2000 by one party. It is now a tolerant, secular state which has survived economic and democratic crises. There\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspno serious prospects of regional secession. Mexico’s new president is a friend of Britain’s Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, but he reflects his own nation and the struggles it contains. A new Mexican democracy is testing itself.

He meant 12 years because, at the risk of being pedantic, England did not qualify for Euro 2008. But yes, it is the biggest game since England played Portugal in the 2006 World Cup, featuring a red card for Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo’s infamous wink and yet more evidence that England are not made for penalty shootouts.Southgate prefers to speak in plain English, not clichés, so he refrained from using the age-old phrase about “taking each game as it comes”. That, however, was the gist of it. Very sensible, too, when history suggests England should not get too far ahead of themselves. Reminder: there were members of Roy Hodgson’s staff punching the air when Iceland scored the last-minute winner against Austria that meant they would be England’s first knockout opponents in Euro 2016.Southgate did acknowledge that England had found themselves in the better half of the draw, with the possibility of a quarter-final against Sweden or Switzerland to follow and, beyond that, a semi-final against Russia or Croatia and no way of meeting France or Brazil until the final.England’s base in the pine forests of Repino may be secluded but Southgate is in enough contact with the wider world to understand that the fervour is building back home. “I am not surprised,” he said. “Whenever people say ‘I don’t care about international football’ that tends to be during the season. Then you come to a big tournament and it is not just football fans, it is grandads, it is aunts, everyone, supporting the team. And, for some reason, they like these lads.”His bigger point was that this was not a time to think of any other match apart from the next one. “That was a trap we’ve fallen into in the past,” he said. “I can see everybody is more excited but we have to think separately, otherwise we just get carried away on the wave of emotion and we would not be thinking clearly about what we have to affect. We have to control the bits we have to control. But we would be foolish to focus on longer into the tournament.”Again it came back to the Iceland game and the mistake many people made of assuming England were set for a quarter-final against France in Paris. Hodgson and his assistant, Ray Lewington, did not even bother going to the Iceland-Austria game to make a personal check their next opponents, preferring instead to spend the day sightseeing and going on a boat journey down the river Seine. Even now, two years on, it seems like a remarkable oversight and listening to Southgate it was clear he felt the attitude of the players was wrong, too.“A few of these players, in the last championships, were in a fixture they thought they should win. Then, once they went behind, they suddenly felt that approach wasn’t correct. We won’t fall into that trap again, against a really good team. It is one of many games that we have unpicked because it would be silly not to look at previous tournaments and try to identify what we can learn.”Not to be too presumptuous, for starters. Colombia, after all, are hardly a team that England can underestimate, particularly if James Rodríguez is fit to take his place in a forward line with Radamel Falcao and Juan Cuadrado. England have not kept a clean sheet here and, if they are to make it into the final eight, a lot depends on the three-man backline of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Harry Maguire, how well Jordan Henderson can shield them as the only defensive midfielder and whether Jordan Pickford can look more assured in goal.At the same time England have Southgate’s first-choice XI available, with Fabian Delph the only absentee now he has flown home to attend the birth of his child – or, as Southgate put it, “buying his wife curries and all sorts of other strange things”. Southgate is encouraged by the energy of his team’s performances and did not seem too troubled when it was pointed out to him that it will be 999 days since Raheem Sterling, with two England goals in 40 appearances, last scored for his country.“We have a very difficult opponent – a very good side who we respect –and the level of the game is going up a notch,” Southgate said. “But we think we can cause opposing teams a lot of problems and that won’t change because we are in the knockout phase.

Tabárez’s team had already made it to the last 16 and rumours had spread there would be major changes to his starting XI.In response he fell back on a familiar phrase. “We do not speculate,” Tabárez announced. It is a distinctly Uruguayan note of defiance, a reminder that this is the most fiercely competitive of\u0026nbspfootballing nations, notorious for\u0026nbspits warrior spirit, what Jorge Valdano referred to in these pages as\u0026nbspthe “Garra Charrúa” culture, named after the native tribe which, rather than offering to negotiate, killed and ate their European\u0026nbspinvaders.Resting players, going slow, soft‑pedalling a winnable game: Tabárez and Uruguay refused to contemplate this. Russia were duly dispatched 3-0, ignition for the subsequent defeat of Portugal in the\u0026nbsplast 16. France will provide powerful over-dog opposition on Friday. But Uruguay are ticking now, fired by the thrill of competition. This is a team where nobody sleeps until this tournament is done one way or another.And so on to England and a backstory that has swirled just out of sight around the deliciously well‑matched last-16 tie against Colombia at the Spartak Stadium on Tuesday night. In Gareth we trust. For now. Depending on how things turn out. But it is hard to avoid the sense of contrast here. England, it seems, do speculate at World Cups.With Spain dumped out of the draw by Russia on Sunday afternoon Southgate’s decision not to field his most powerful team in the final Group\u0026nbspG game has begun to look an ever more wildly polarised piece of tactical thinking.So much reasoning in sport is reverse-engineered out of results, which are in turn decided on the tiniest details. History is written, in gloating 10-point headlines, by the\u0026nbspwinners.But this is what Southgate is now facing. The danger is that the effects of a calculated gamble – and probably a wrong-headed one – will\u0026nbspnow be ramped up by subsequent results.Win against Colombia and Southgate will have shuttled England towards near-certain World\u0026nbspCup glory. Lose and England’s manager will be open to accusations of having tried, unsuccessfully, to juke the draw at a tournament and fallen short of the obligation to compete to the maximum in every game, another case in sport of an obvious strength – planning, thoroughness, “owning the situation” – becoming\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspflaw.The comparison might be made with 1950, when England’s selection committee left out Stanley Matthews against the amateurs of the USA in Belo Horizonte, saving their ace for tougher challenges in the later rounds, only to find themselves guilty of the kind of starchy British post-imperial arrogance to which only a slightly wooden Hollywood re-enactment can do justice.With this in mind it is probably a good idea to pack this away now. Southgate was either right or wrong to make eight changes in\u0026nbspKaliningrad.The dumb luck of being sunk by a defensive mistake on Tuesday night, or a fine performance from an opponent, should not change this.And probably there was a slight mis-step here, albeit one made out of good intentions. Judging by Southgate’s obiter dicta at his post‑match press conference it seems England were broadly convinced that the choice for the last\u0026nbsp16 would boil down to Senegal and Colombia. Colombia are ranked 16th in the world, Senegal 27th. Strong opponents both: better to face either one with a fresher first XI.So Southgate will have chosen his team for Belgium the day before the game. The players will have been told. Overnight in Kaliningrad the skies were filled with travelling agents turning up to see their charges make their World Cup bows.Except, two hours before kick‑off things changed. Japan had finished above Senegal in Group H. Suddenly there was a genuine choice. Winning Group\u0026nbspG would dish up a tie against opponents ranked 61 in the world, below Panama. Yes, the other half of the draw already looked easier beyond that stage. But given a straight choice and no preconceptions most England managers would take the Tabárez line. We do not speculate. We play to win.Southgate chose not to strengthen his team. Elements such as loyalty and balance and happiness in the group come into this. It was a measured call. It did not work out. But it will still hover round his shoulders, a blow ready to fall should England slip up in Moscow when they might have been in Rostov playing Japan.Whereas in reality this must all be balanced against a mass of positives on the other side. The comparison with Euro 2016 has been made, when England made six changes for the final group game against Slovakia in Saint-Etienne, drew 0-0, then played against Iceland like a team recently roused from cryogenic storage.But so far it is the contrast that stands out. By the time the Iceland game came round Wayne Rooney had already leaked to the press his anger at being dropped. Senior FA figures had made clear their unhappiness with the manager, his ever more distant hopes of a new\u0026nbspcontract.Compare and contrast the complete absence of leaks or noises off from within the Harry Kane industrial complex. Kane has five goals in two games. He wanted to play against Belgium\u0026nbspB, then Japan, then have a square go at Brazil.He did not want to be rested. His agent wants him to win the Golden Boot. But there has been no suggestion of public disappointment, of anything less than a functioning team at work. This in itself is progress.Plus, there is always another side. Uruguay do not speculate. But they have arrived at the quarter-finals without Edinson Cavani, their top scorer’s hamstring twanged against Portugal after he missed only one minute of the previous three World Cup games.Meanwhile Croatia did rest players for their final group stage match but played their worst game of the tournament against Denmark off the back of it.It is surely better to judge Southgate’s progress on more tangible evidence. And not on the whims, the fury, the fine details of Colombia in Moscow, a game that deserves to stand alone, and to be played out without looking back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1d3ed25c29f3523f2012d754f6d3753d55bc24/0_39_2057_1234/master/2057.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c96ae8dc6b67bd9093899e7da6bba5e","title":"marouane fellaini nacer chadli fringes belgium hazard flatters","story":"Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli play bit-part roles at their clubs but proved their worth with goals to beat JapanHearts sank like lost shoes in a muddy field in Manchester when the news emerged last week. Derision, resignation, bafflement: United had a perfect opportunity to rid themselves of Marouane Fellaini but instead they gave him a new contract.If one listened to some of the wailing, it felt as if Fellaini was an irritating house guest, the sort who puts his shoes on the couch and takes bites out of the cheese. The time had come for him to move on but United not only invited him back in for a brew, they made him up a proper bed in the spare room.And then there is Nacer Chadli. It was, to say the least, an eyebrow‑raiser when he was even named in the Belgium squad for Russia: one had to look up where he was playing his club football and, as it turns out, it was still West Brom. Not that he had actually played much: he had spent virtually the whole season out injured, making his call-up even more baffling. This was not Brazil fretting on Neymar’s fitness: this was Nacer Chadli.And yet these two unwanted toys, discarded in the minds of many, were the men who saved Belgium. One could almost hear the snorts when they were introduced, proof that Roberto Martínez was a smooth‑talking snake-oil salesman, not a manager but a motivational speaker with some coaching badges. Fellaini and Chadli? Pah!Shows what we know. Or, it shows that football generally, and this World Cup specifically, is absolute chaos. Nothing can be predicted. Nothing can be planned for.This is a tournament where Russia look like potential champions and Germany are sulking at home for the first time since before the war. A tournament where Thomas Müller and Andrés Iniesta have been virtual irrelevances but Fellaini and Chadli are game-changers.Before the game the talk was about a more conventionally desirable player. On Sunday Eden Hazard was asked about the departure from the tournament of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and what that might mean to him.It was framed as creating a vacancy for a tournament-defining star, a chance for Hazard to translate his frequent brilliance for Chelsea on to the international stage. “It’s time to shine,” he said, with a sort of dead-eyed certainty.He started as if that was his big aim, the juices flowing from the off. There was a driving run through the middle, a delicate flick with his right foot, a finger‑stinging shot with his left. He seemed more aggressive than usual: not in the tackle but in his movements. Fine skill combined with a point to prove.But as the game progressed he faded, though he did hit a post after Japan’s first goal. He might take it as an insult that Martínez went for the hammer and smashed the emergency glass, reaching for the sinewy tree that goes by the name Fellaini. Insult it might be, but it worked.Perhaps, if nothing else, this game might provide some succour to despairing United fans. Really, they should know what Fellaini is there for by now. He is an impact substitute, a creator of chaos to turn to when order and sound planning have not worked.Assuming he is used in these sorts of circumstance, as the plan\u0026nbspB muscle, he is a perfectly fine option – effective, ugly, not capable of elite football, not capable of much that is recognised as football at all, really, and yet someone who can change matches.Which is what he did here. Japan almost looked cocky in the minutes after they scored their second through Takashi Inui and then, when Fellaini and Chadli were introduced, it was as if they looked to the sidelines and thought: “Is that all they’ve got? This is in the bag, lads.”Well, it was not in the bag. It was very much out of the bag. Thanks to Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli, Belgium’s golden generation live to fight another day. What a world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c1d8c6ce36a3e096d3bef665d49f4a6156f37f/0_57_4579_2748/master/4579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17db1afac11c7011b25ca3db5afef8dd","title":"wayne rooney dc united mls","story":"Wayne\u0026nbspRooney\u0026nbspinsists he has not moved to DC United to wind down his career and that he retains the hunger required to succeed in Major League Soccer.The 32-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract to leave Everton and conclude a decorated career in England.

From the minute you find out and you’re puking everywhere, to the thoughts that run through your head about the things you imagine doing if someone harmed your child.” Pregnancy, she adds, can make you feral.You can’t talk about a new novel that deals with sexual assault without looking at it through the lens of #MeToo, particularly when the author made waves last year after accusing Oscar-nominated actor James Woods of preying on her when she was 16 (Woods denies the allegations). Tamblyn is also one of the founders of Time’s Up, an organisation launched at the beginning of this year to fight sexual harassment in the film industry.However, Tamblyn’s decision to make her antagonist a woman did not start with an intention to expand the conversation around sexual assault. When she first started toying with writing a novel four years ago, long before Harvey Weinstein was exposed, she began with the observation that it is rare to see a truly awful female antagonist. Someone who is “doing things without consequence and for no other reason than she just enjoyed them. For so many movies and books, if there is a female antagonist, they’re usually doing something to get back at someone. There has to be a redeemable quality, no matter how small. Even if it’s their prettiness.”Writing Any Man was cathartic. While Tamblyn says she has never been sexually assaulted “in any of the ways” in the book, she knows what it is like to be a victim of sexual violence. She has spoken openly, for example, about an ex-boyfriend who assaulted her at a nightclub in Hollywood, dragging her out of the venue “by my private parts”.Writing Any Man was also physically painful. “I had really severe carpal tunnel syndrome and De Quervain syndrome in both arms … if I typed for long periods of time, my arms would go numb. My hands would go numb, part of my cheek would go numb.” This was partly due to pregnancy and the repetitive strain of typing, but she thinks there was also a psychological element. “I think if Carl Jung were examining this, he would say that I was also possibly breaking out of some sort of a physical cast that I had been in my entire life. Perhaps it was actually my body attempting to feel for the first time.”Tamblyn started acting when she was 11. She grew up saying other people’s words and feeling other people’s feelings, being watched without truly being seen. “I think my experience growing up was one of long-term varied objectification,” she says. “All I’ve ever done is act. Even though there were so many other things swirling in my head.”She started getting that swirl on to paper a few years ago. In 2015, Tamblyn released a poetry collection called Dark Sparkler, about the lives and deaths of child actors. All of a sudden, she had physical ailments that “seemed to come out of nowhere”. But they did not really, she notes. “It has occurred to me that someone should do a study on artists who have to emote for a living and what that does to the central nervous system.”Of course, it is not just actors who emote for a living. Being a woman has traditionally meant demonstrating the right sort of emotions: smiling on demand, being polite, internalising your anger Lately, however, the anger has been uncorked. From Nasty Woman T-shirts to the #MeToo movement, women aren’t afraid of proclaiming how pissed off they are. How they are sick of having our bodies and emotions policed. That anger has bubbled up in pop culture. While reading Any Man, I was reminded of Dietland, a bestselling novel by Sarai Walker, recently turned into a TV show, which features a shadowy vigilante feminist group known only as “Jennifer” that murders predatory men.Tamblyn has not heard of Dietland and is careful to stress that Any Man is not a revenge fantasy. “Yes, there’s a lot of anger,” she says, but “I want to look past the anger at what is underneath it. And what is underneath it is a lack of empathy. When you don’t feel seen, you, of course, get furious, which I think is how a lot of women have felt for a long time.” Tamblyn carefully distinguishes sympathy from empathy. Sympathy, she says, is being able to rationalise why someone did something. Empathy, however, is “connecting with people on a larger whole, with who they are. Part of the huge disconnect within the #MeToo movement, for example – and it is very wild that this book was written so long before it – is that men can sympathise with women, but I don’t know that they empathise. They don’t know how to. This experience is really forcing men to empathise with the daily experience of womanhood.”Rape culture and gender inequality is not about men versus women, Tamblyn says. We all need to empathise more and interrogate our own complicity. “I think liberals do that. In this country, they do it too much, to the point where it harms them. And conservatives don’t do it at all. To the point where it harms them.”It would be hard to talk about complicity without mentioning Tamblyn’s husband, the comedian David Cross, who plays Tobias Fünke in the sitcom Arrested Development. In May, a New York Times interview with the cast of Arrested Development was held up as a disturbing demonstration of how complicity works. When the interviewer brought up accusations of sexual misconduct (which he denies) and harassment against the cast member Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walter (who plays Lucille Bluth) spoke tearfully about how Tambor had yelled at her on set. The male actors, including Cross, quickly rallied to Tambor’s defence, talking over Walter and minimising her experience.And, again, she says, that is really the point of Any Man: to show, not tell. To show the violence of objectification the physical and psychological violence of assault the violence of not being believed.“To find a way to get people who have been blind their whole lives to see. That is the work. That is the only way that things can change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9f4fe17aae8654f95d63020c8debbf8965cc89/0_377_7929_4759/master/7929.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6642a0a215b3c46f99764fd8654eac9","title":"anna jones cherry recipes","story":"You can’t beat cherries straight from a bag – unless you try this almond cherry cobbler and roasted cherry saladCherries are hands down my favourite fruit. During these summer weeks, I buy a bag most days. They’re almost always best eaten straight out of the bag, but there are a few recipes where cooked cherries rival fresh. One is this cherry cobbler, an intensely sweet-sour party between cherry and its best friend, almond. The other is a cherry salad, the fruit quickly pickled and roasted, popping against the salad leaves and buttermilk dressing.I make this in peak cherry season, when they are most affordable. At other times of the year, you could use some cheaper frozen cherries, or even some pitted and roughly chopped red plums in place of half the cherries.1kg cherries, pitted1 tbsp amaretto or frangelico (optional)Seeds from 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla paste2-4 tbsp honeyZest of 1 unwaxed lemonFor the topping60g almonds, skin on125g white spelt flour1 tsp baking powder50g raw cane sugar or demerara sugar100g unsalted butter, chilled1 pinch flaky sea saltTo serveCreme fraiche, yoghurt or ice-creamHeat the oven to 240C465Fgas 9. First, make the topping. Blitz the almonds in a food processor until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, then add the flour, baking powder and sugar and pulse a couple of times to combine. Cut the butter into cubes and add to the food processor with the salt. Blitz again, until the mixture resembles rough breadcrumbs. Add a tablespoon of water and pulse again until it comes together into a firm dough.Put the cherries, liqueur (if using) and vanilla into a bowl and mix to combine. Grease a 20cm baking dish, and spoon in the cherries, to cover the bottom of the dish. Drizzle over the honey and use a tablespoon to dollop the dough on top, leaving gaps for the juices to bubble through.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the topping has risen and is a deep gold. Top with a few more toasted almonds, if you like, and serve with creme fraiche and a swirl of honey or some ice-cream.I use red-tipped little gems here, but butterhead, oakleaf, lollo rosso and frisée would also work. If you can’t find buttermilk, use yoghurt thinned with a splash of milk for the dressing. Some goat’s cheese or goat’s curd would be a nice addition, too.For the salad200g cherries, pitted and halvedA few sprigs thyme, leaves pickedZest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon2 tbsp red-wine vinegarOlive oilSalt and black pepper4 slices good bread4 little gem lettucesFor the dressing125ml buttermilk or thinned yoghurt (see note)1 tsp runny honey2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Lay the halved cherries on a baking tray, scatter with the thyme and grate over the lemon zest. Drizzle with the vinegar, then with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss the lot together and roast for 15-20 minutes.Tear the bread into chunks, put on another baking tray and season well. Drizzle generously with olive oil, then put in the oven for the last 15 minutes with the cherries. When time is up, the cherries should have darkened a little, their flavour intensified, and the bread should be crisp on the outside, chewy in the middle and deeply golden.To make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients in a jug, or shake in a tightly sealed jar, taste and season.Wash, dry and quarter the lettuces and scatter them on a plate. Once the cherries have cooled a little, scatter them over the lettuce and bread, and drizzle generously with the dressing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855d97666363e7750584645ef2bef22b253c2edb/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd437b8fde2918293e97605e5d8e22a","title":"30000 buying flat london mortgage deposit","story":"I thought I wouldn’t get a mortgage, but my family have offered me help with a depositQ I am a single 38-year-old adult living in London with no dependants.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said government benefit cuts are hitting lower-earning households in the UK, making it increasingly difficult for them to keep up with the rising cost of living. It called on ministers to consider remedies such as ending the benefit freeze in place since 2015 and to raise the universal credit work allowance.Despite an inflation-beating increase for the national minimum wage earlier this year – having risen from £7.50 to £7.83 per hour in April – analysis compiled by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University on behalf of the JRF showed families were still falling behind.The report said a single person needed to earn £18,400 a year to reach the minimum income standard, which is a measure of income people need in order to reach a minimum socially acceptable standard of living in the UK, from £17,900 when the requirement was last calculated a year ago. A dual-earner couple with two children needed to earn £20,000 each, while a lone parent with a preschool child had to earn £28,450 – an increase of £2,500 on the previous year.Although the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds middle-class households have fared best in the decade since the financial crisis in a recent study, it found people at the top and the bottom had suffered weaker income growth. According to the JRF, a lone parent working full-time on the minimum wage in 2008 – with help from tax credits introduced under Labour – had a disposable income just £520 a year short of their needs. Following almost a decade of tax credit cuts under Conservative-led governments, people in this situation are about £3,640 a year short.

May, promising to publish the long-awaited Brexit white paper next week, said it would include “proposals relating to customs and Northern Ireland”.It is designed to replace the discredited customs partnership model that was favoured by May and the maximum facilitation model preferred by the Brexiters and the majority of her inner cabinet, both of which had been rejected by the European Union as unworkable.But there were complaints about the lack of detail, with some senior cabinet members saying they were not aware of what was contained in fresh proposals, while Number 10 would not be drawn on who had been involved in its development.Details would be unveiled for the full cabinet to sign off at Chequers on Friday, although there were early indications it would not involve the UK signing up to the EU’s system of common external tariff for goods in a revamped maximum facilitation proposal as some Brexiters had feared.Jeremy Corbyn sought to play up Tory isions on the UK’s post Brexit future in the Commons. Speaking in a debate about last week’s European council meeting, the Labour leader said he “looked forward to the much vaunted third way on customs that the prime minister hopes will unite her cabinet, because the current chaos at the heart of government leaves us facing crucial unanswered questions”.May responded with an emotional appeal for party unity at a ball for party donors in London. Describing the stakes as high, the prime minister said: “We each have a choice to make. Will we come together and stand together as a party, as a government and as a country?“Will we find the boldness, the courage and the discipline to unite as one for the good of our nation and fellow citizens? Or will we be ided and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?”The prime minister will travel to see Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, on Tuesday and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Thursday. Number 10 insisted that neither leader would get an advance briefing on the customs proposal that is intended to break the political deadlock in the Tory party.Meanwhile, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was forced to leap to the defence of leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, after the MP for North East Somerset was criticised by party colleagues for warning that May risked splitting her party as Sir Robert Peel did when he forced through the repeal of the corn laws in 1846.As May’s statement to the Commons was concluding, Johnson tweeted: “It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country.”Earlier, two Foreign Office ministers, Alistair Burt and Alan Duncan, publicly rebuked Rees-Mogg. Duncan accused him of “insolence” and said his “lecturing and threatening the PM is just too much”, adding: “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Burt accused Rees-Mogg of being part of an “ideological clique” in a tweet after the article was published. “Just tired of this endless threat and counter-threat,” he wrote. “Why don’t we want the best for the UK than for our own ideological cliques? And there are others in this negotiation as far as I’m aware?”Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of pro-Brexit Tory MPs, writing in the , said: “Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised. One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way.Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, urged May not to listen to the “arbitrary red lines” of Brexiters like Rees-Mogg. Speaking in the Commons, to complaints from her own benches, Morgan called on the prime minister to “find a pragmatic, sensible and flexible Brexit which delivers on the referendum result of two years ago but protects businesses and jobs and the economy and entrepreneurs, otherwise we will not be thanked for the mess that we end up in”.Cabinet ministers intend to turn on the charm to justify their post-Brexit strategy, with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, organising a summit for business leaders at Chevening House on 20 July, the week after the white paper is published.It comes after Johnson had reportedly said “fuck business” at a reception in response to corporate concerns about the lack of clarity emerging from the British government, and a desire by business for a soft Brexit deal that would as far as possible replicate the UK’s existing trading relations with the EU.The invitation from Davis said that the idea was to “to use this opportunity to assemble another group of business leaders from across the economy, including some new voices who were unable to join us last time, to continue the dialogue”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b745aba1e897fad2d440c04857fb9f4137fdee12/157_22_1763_1058/master/1763.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9dcfd3a8a57528f8d431c95cfdea94","title":"maybot launches pm vr construct alternate brexit reality","story":"Prime minister constructs a safe space where she can finally be in charge and showcase her new 3D customs modelWhen all else fails, just make it up. Right now, not even Theresa May wants to be Theresa May. Some might argue she never did. Just about everything that could go wrong, has gone wrong. Most of it of her own making. There is no area of the government that is running effectively and with the prime minister’s personal authority utterly diminished by her own incompetence, the cabinet is now bound by collective irresponsibility. A 29-person rogue state.Under the circumstances, then, you can’t entirely blame May for deciding to construct her reality as she would like it to be. A safe place where she can imagine herself to be in charge. Of herself, if nothing else. So when she came to the Commons to give her statement on last week’s EU summit, she offered a version of events that was unrecognisable to anyone who had been following them.The summit had been a huge success. One at which she had played a key role on immigration and security matters by going out to get the coffees for the other leaders when the talks had dragged on into the night. As for Brexit, she had warned the EU that it had to stop all the dawdling and get on with the negotiations. Time was running out and if Michel Barnier caused any further needless delays she would get very, very cross.A few ministers sitting alongside the prime minister dutifully nodded their heads as if they were in a hostage video, but the rest of a rather sparse chamber looked understandably perplexed. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, spoke for most MPs when he observed that a cabinet that was not even able to agree on what it wanted itself and had repeatedly missed all its own deadlines was hardly in a position to moan about the EU.“It’s time to pick a side,” Corbyn said. The prime minister was indignant. She had picked a side. She had picked the fence and she was going to carry on sitting on it until someone pushed her off. There had been loads of progress in the negotiations and things were absolutely on schedule. Apart from the bits that weren’t, which were down to Labour frustrating Brexit. Just moments ago it had been the EU holding up negotiations, now it was the opposition.Too far gone in her own fantasy to spot the contradiction, May went on to insist that the fact so many organisations were making emergency preparations for a no deal Brexit was a sign of just how thorough and well advanced the government’s planning had been. She had made some proposals and she was going to make some further proposals at some unspecified time or other.And if those further proposals came to nothing she would make further, further proposals. Some of which she might even disclose to her own cabinet. David Davis looked even grumpier and more out of his depth than usual, having only learned that May had now come up with a third customs idea that the EU had also rejected, when he had switched on his radio that morning.May, though, was beginning to feel comfortable. There was something quite cosy about existing in a cocooned delusional state and she was determined to do nothing that might drag her back to a semblance of reality. William Cash butted in to check that his punishment Brexit was still the government’s preferred option. May just smiled and nodded. His Brexit could be whatever he wanted it to be.Immediately, a disturbed Anna Soubry bounced to her feet to check that her soft Brexit was still on the cards. “Of course,” May mumbled. She too could have whatever Brexit she wanted. Saying whatever anyone wanted to hear was so much easier than making a decision. She would be whatever anyone wanted her to be. Why pretend to have any sense of self?Though May was oblivious to her internal inconsistencies, her circuit board began to overload. Before long she had lost all grasp of language and went full Maybot. “There has been some jocularity around the term Brexit means Brexit,” she said, “but it does mean Brexit.” Brexit means Brexit means Brexit. After two years we were really no further on than this. The prime minister was too far gone to realise she was dying on her feet. Just as the country was dying on its feet.

MPs should also be banned from taking on outside jobs as parliamentary strategists, advisers or consultants, the committee said. Lord Bew, the committee chair, said MPs should continually demonstrate integrity, and that some have failed to do so. “Where a small number of iniduals have taken up outside interests beyond what might be considered reasonable, it risks undermining trust in parliament and parliamentarians,” he said.Based on parliament’s register of members’ interests up to March, the total annual earnings from regular outside interests amounts to approximately £3.35m. The register includes three consultantsadvisers, 30 writers and 59 speakers, panellists or radio contributors. Jobs as political strategists and advisers are much less common than in the past, the committee said, and it expressed concern they could lead to MPs developing privileged relationships with particular organisations, resulting in “undue influence” being brought to bear on parliament. The committee originally launched its inquiry in March last year in the wake of the political storm that followed the appointment of former chancellor George Osborne as editor of the Evening Standard, alongside a series of other lucrative appointments, while he was still an MP. Osborne, who stood down as an MP last year, is among those to have given evidence to the committee.In its report, the committee called for a reform to the register to make it more “accessible, searchable and usable” by the public. The current rules on when MPs needed to declare an interest are “complex and unclear”, it said, and it called for voters to be told what outside interests parliamentary candidates intend to hold if they are elected. Minister Nadhim Zahawi tops the list of Conservative MPs for outside earnings, earning an equivalent annual salary of £765,000, according to reports.The MP for Stratford-on-Avon, who co-founded the polling business YouGov, was the chief strategy officer at the oil exploration company Gulf Keystone Petroleum, from which he received £29,643 a month. He has now stood down from that job.Many MPs claim work outside of parliament means they have a broader range of experience and are less likely to be “career politicians”.But many critics have called for a ban on second jobs, saying it would increase public trust in politicians.MPs are not allowed to act as “paid advocates” and have to declare their financial interests, including paid employment outside parliament, in the register.There are also restrictions on the roles cabinet ministers are entitled to take up immediately after leaving office."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269c9486a2bbf73c8d3937236a78f0bef3536b1c/29_58_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8156457e9d90e2b98d2c9d64e654552","title":"cameron norrie laim broady britains lack of depth","story":"Then there were two and that it was Aljaz Bedene, back representing Slovenia, who has left the British men’s ranks so depleted is an irony lost on few. Indeed, though he does not compete for Great Britain any more, he revealed the England football captain, Harry Kane, played a role in his first-round victory against Cameron Norrie.This time last year Bedene was celebrating a five-set win against Ivo Karlovic that ignited the home crowd 12 months on and his four-set victory against Norrie has left British hopes reliant on Kyle Edmund and the teenage wildcard Jay Clarke. Andy Murray’s 11th-hour withdrawal has highlighted how fragile the supporting cast is.Bedene used to be among that number but, not permitted to represent Great Britain in the Davis Cup, having previously done so for Slovenia, he switched back after three and a half years competing under the union flag. This victory must have been all the sweeter then against Norrie, born in South Africa to British parents, raised in New Zealand and college trained in the United States.“Against Tunisia he was pulled down and he stayed calm. I would freak out, because it was an important moment. I kept calm, which was good, although it wasn’t easy, because most of the things went against me.”Norrie certainly had his moments, indeed he took the first set, but ultimately on his second Wimbledon he came up short. Bedene was competing for a sixth time here and perhaps that was the decisive factor – he won two tie-breaks in the third and fourth set, showing a touch more composure at the crucial points of an absorbing match, clinching a 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory. Nonetheless Norrie turned professional only 14 months ago and to qualify outright, rather than rely on a wildcard, suggests a bright future.“I handled the occasion a lot better than I did last year and I’ve grown a lot over the last year as a player but he just played more clutch than me in both tie-breaks,” Norrie said.All is not entirely lost for Great Britain and Edmund, seeded 21st, is expected to beat the Australian qualifier Alex Bolt comfortably on Tuesday but defeat would leave Great Britain’s men’s contingent staring down the barrel of failing to get anyone beyond the first round for the first time in the open era.Liam Broady, another wildcard, was the other Briton to bow out on Monday, competitive for the opening set against the 2016 finalist, Milos Raonic, but ultimately blown away by the big-serving Canadian, going down 7-5, 6-0, 6-1. As he pointed out afterwards, the British ranks would be strengthened were Dan Evans in attendance but Broady stopped short of questioning the decision not to give Evans a wildcard, having returned from his one-year drugs ban in April. “Dan is a fantastic grass court player, he’s a fantastic tennis player full stop and he’s beautiful to watch on the court,” Broady said. “But the All England made their decisions for obvious reasons. I think Dan understands that as well as anybody.”Considering Broady is ranked 173rd in the world, there is little shame in losing to the 13th seed, even if Raonic won 13 of the last 12 games. If the 24-year-old was competitive in the opening set, eventually losing serve at 5-6 down with two consecutive backhands into the net, here was an illustration of the work that needs to be done to qualify on merit, citing Norrie as the example to follow.“I’m hoping to get to the place that Cam’s in now,” Broady said. “He did a great job of it. It took him less than a year to get into the top 100. It definitely gives me heart to know that type of player can do really well.”Norrie undoubtedly did so in a tight first set, edging it 6-4 but he lost a second in which he broke back twice in a tie-break. The third went the distance again but when a Norrie doubt fault ensured it went the way of Bedene, the Briton was always facing an uphill battle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16e91ca58a8b80bae848b8cd37b4a1c20a1840c/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03a5eb8ba5e19591943f7c7ebf97b4a6","title":"froome slow process lack detail annoy organisers experts","story":"The verdict fell suddenly in the nine‑month saga of Chris Froome’s adverse analytical finding for Salbutamol. Most notably it wrongfooted the Tour\u0026nbspde\u0026nbspFrance organisers, who were expecting a court hearing on Tuesday morning to resolve their attempt, dating back three weeks, to refuse Froome entry to their race on the grounds that with the outcome in abeyance his presence would be damaging for the image of their race.That attempt was rendered irrelevant immediately on Monday morning when a statement from the UCI cleared Froome of any wrongdoing. Crucially, given the length of time the process had taken, there were no hints of a possible appeal. There were also, however, few details from the governing body an explanation came from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which – the UCI made clear – had been involved from relatively early in the proceedings.The Wada statement said, in essence, that Froome had demonstrated the levels of Salbutamol found in his urine samples varied widely enough for the finding to be within a certain margin of error (“demonstrated within‑subject variability in the excretion of Salbutamol”) and that he had been ill and had upped his dosage. It also accepted that in his case a comparative study was not possible because it was impossible to replicate the conditions how the sample had been taken. Crucially, the statement concluded “the sample result is not inconsistent with an ingestion of Salbutamol within the permitted maximum inhaled dose”, mentioning also that there had been “chronic use of Salbutamol at varying doses over the course of weeks of high intensity competition”.The verdict left Froome in the clear to attempt a record-equalling fifth victory in the Tour de France, a double of Giro d’Italia and Tour de France in the same season, and a “quat-trick” of four grand tour victories in a row: Tour and Vuelta 2017, Giro and Tour 2018. Critically, it fell before the start of the Tour de France, eliminating that court case between Froome and the organisers and removing any potential ambiguity over the results of the 2018 Tour. Fans would be able to watch him racing in the knowledge that the case was no longer pending.The Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, was – understandably – frustrated at the way events had left his organisation with egg on its face and he bemoaned the length of time the proceedings had taken. “Above all, it’s a pity that we have had to wait for months, because the lack of answers in all this time has obviously given rise to indecision, doubt and thus to suspicion. That’s where we have ended up.”The one thing lacking in the verdict was a detailed exposition of the nuts and bolts of Froome’s defence, although the cyclist told Sky News that he would be making information public in the next few days. The lack of detail was bemoaned by one anti-doping expert Robin Parisotto, speaking to cyclingnews, said he felt it detracted from the verdict. “It’s now about having full access to the reasoned decision as it’s hard to comment without it,” said Parisotto, a former member of the UCI’s Biological Passport programme. “This is a case where they need to release the report in order to silence the agitators. I’m bamboozled to be honest.”The Froome ruling raised other questions, most notably whether it had established a precedent for further Salbutamol cases. Wada rules – as quoted in the organisations statement on the Froome case – specify that if Salbutamol is found over a certain threshold it “is presumed not to be an intended therapeutic use of the substance and will be considered as an AAF unless the athlete proves, through a controlled pharmacokinetic study, that the abnormal result was the consequence of the use of the therapeutic dose (by inhalation) up to the maximum dose indicated above”.The Froome ruling appears to have departed from that particular part of the rule, because a key factor in the case was the fact that the study could not be carried out in a way that replicated those in which the sample was taken. That will most likely be claimed to apply in other cases. The question of where it left the threshold for Salbutamol was also hanging perhaps Salbutamol would go the way of caffeine, where it proved impossible to regulate the substance by working with a permitted threshold and it was eventually legalised to avoid\u0026nbspconfusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97256ef44e511b3e0ff230cf3b1b093cb75eb779/0_178_4789_2875/master/4789.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18e18929e4d267a2063dff92a20f677","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez democratic politics","story":"Less than a week after her stunning primary win, Ocasio-Cortez is told she’s too leftwing to win key midwestern votes. Not surprisingly, she disagreesIn April 2016, Bernie Sanders’ political revolution fizzled to a halt in New York. Hillary Clinton’s adopted home elevated her to within striking distance of the Democratic nomination. The loss was a devastating blow to Sanders’ progressive supporters.And yet that setback helped prepare the ground for one of this year’s most shocking political upsets.In a primary last Tuesday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old leftwing activist and Sanders organizer, defeated Joe Crowley, a 10-term House Democrat and potential contender for speaker, in an outer-borough New York district.“We’re in the middle of a movement in this country,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN after her win. “I feel this movement, but that movement is going to happen from the bottom up. That movement is going to come from voters.”Progressives hailed the win as proof of a growing grassroots movement.“Just like in 1916 when we saw the beginning of a progressive movement in response to the Gilded Age, I believe the Trump era is going to bring a progressive renaissance in this country,” said Ro Khanna, the only member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez – albeit in a dual recommendation with Crowley.Ocasio-Cortez, Khanna said, “is a harbinger of that new progressive movement”.And yet, for a Democratic party in search of a new identity in the Trump era, her victory has offered little immediate clarity.“When you knock off somebody like this, it’s very significant – and it doesn’t happen by accident,” said Jim Kessler of the centrist thinktank Third Way.But he added that Ocasio-Cortez’s win was less an endorsement of her leftwing ideology than a reflection of Democratic voters’ current preference for fresh faces and female candidates.On Sunday, the Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth suggested Ocasio-Cortez’s leftwing politics could alienate moderate midwestern voters.“I think that you can’t win the White House without the midwest,” Duckworth told CNN’s State of the Union. “And I don’t think that you can go too far to the left and still win the midwest.“Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial midwest. You need to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide.”While it is true that in 2016 Sanders did not win the nationwide contest, he did beat Clinton in Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin, midwestern states which backed Obama but abandoned the Democrats for Trump. Two years later, in one of the most liberal enclaves in America, Ocasio-Cortez ran on a progressive platform that included several core policy issues proposed by Sanders.She pledged support for Medicare for All and tuition-free public college, backed a federal jobs-guarantee program and called for Congress to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).That earned her the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, a fact upon which Republicans have duly seized, claiming her win shows Democrats have moved too far to the left.On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez also appeared on the talk shows. On NBC’s Meet the Press, she was asked how she would “sell” her views to an older generation of Americans perhaps “afraid of the S-word”.“It’s part of what I am,” she said. “It’s not all of what I am. And I think that that’s a very important distinction. I’m an educator. I’m an organizer. And I believe that what we’re really seeing is just a movement for healthcare, housing and education in the United States.”Bill de Blasio agrees. The mayor of New York backed Crowley but in a statement issued after Ocasio-Cortez’s win, he said the Democratic party was “in a deep and fast process of change” and declared its future to be “decidedly progressive”.Until Tuesday, progressives had achieved only handful of notable electoral successes while suffering losses in Virginia, Ohio and Iowa. But there are other signs their message is resonating. A third of Senate Democrats, including many prospective 2020 candidates, and more than half of House Democrats support Sanders’ single-payer healthcare plan. Calls for minimum wage are widespread and many have adopted the anti-Wall Street rhetoric that was a trademark of Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign.In the House, Democrats must gain 23 seats if they are to retake the majority. As primary season nears the home stretch, the party has expressed confidence in a crop of contenders who have emerged in battleground districts.Speaking anonymously, an aide to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argued that primary voters have largely unified around Democrats with the best chances of unseating Republicans. Twenty-seven of the party’s 29 “red to blue” candidates have won their races so far, the aide said – adding that many of those candidates track toward the center of the party, especially on healthcare and the economy.After Tuesday’s election, Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Ocasio-Cortez’s win was a reflection of the party’s “vitality” but was not indicative of a wider shift in its beliefs.“They made a choice in one district,” she said, adding that the fact 27,000 voters in a liberal district elected a more progressive candidate was “about that district” and “not to be viewed as something that stands for anything else”.“I think that there are a lot of districts in this country that are like New York 14,” she told NBC, “that have changed a lot in the last 20 years and whose representation has not.”Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran political consultant based in New York, said Crowley’s defeat should set off alarm bells for incumbents of either party.“The electorate is angry and both parties are in serious trouble,” he said. “The schism is huge and the coalitions are brittle. The difference is that the Republicans found one angry man to unite their anger.”Ocasio-Cortez said she felt such frustration knocking on doors in Queens and the Bronx. That sentiment, she told CNN, extended beyond “just one district”.After her win, she joined Sanders in endorsing Brent Welder, a labor lawyer and former Sanders delegate who is running in a Republican-held suburban Kansas City district that Clinton won narrowly. His August primary will likely be the next major test of the strength of the left.Like Ocasio-Cortez, Welder embraces single-payer healthcare and rejects corporate donations. Though his district is very far from New York, he is confident “progressive values” can resonate across demographic and geographic ides.“Her support in this race really helps us prove to the voters that this is the way to win and the way to achieve good progressive policy,” Welder told the .New York 14 is a safe Democratic seat. Next year, Ocasio-Cortez will almost certainly be in Washington. She has vowed to bring a “caucus” with her.“There’s a real hunger out there among voters for boldness and change agents,” said congressman Raul Grijalva, a co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus. “That’s what she presented and she won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13098cee1e8cf8c2d23704be903b4ff97685be8d/0_121_4818_2892/master/4818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebc82fcc64e778f3a807bf53663bd0af","title":"remove confederate presidents statue from virginia capital commission says","story":"An official report is urging major changes to Monument Avenue in Richmond, which features five statues of Confederate leadersA commission studying what to do with prominent Confederate monuments in Richmond, Virginia, has recommended removing one that honors Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. It also said permanent signage with historical context should be erected near other statues.Richmond, the state capital, was the second capital of the Confederate States of America, after Montgomery, Alabama. Monument Avenue, a prestigious residential street, has five soaring Confederate statues. The first, of the general Robert E Lee, was erected in 1890. The other statues – to Davis, the cavalry commander Jeb Stuart, the general Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson and the naval commander Matthew Fontaine Maury – were raised in the early 20th century.A statue of the African American tennis player Arthur Ashe, a Richmond native, was added in 1996, provoking a nationally publicized and racially charged dispute. The Davis statue, the commission said, “is the most unabashedly Lost Cause in its design and sentiment” and should be removed, pending litigation or changes in state law. “Lost Cause” refers to a view of history, long prevalent in southern states, which minimises the role of slavery in causing the American civil war, which was fought between 1861 and 1865 and through which slavery was abolished in the US.An inscription on the Davis monument “styles the Confederate president as a ‘Defender of the Rights of States’”, the report noted. The panel was made up of historians, local officials and others and spent about a year studying and soliciting public input. In a report of more than 100 pages, it said city leaders should consider adding new monuments that would reflect a “more inclusive” story. “In the course of the work, it became abundantly clear the majority of the public acknowledges Monument Avenue cannot and should not remain exactly as it is. Change is needed and desired,” the report said. A Virginia state law, which the Republican-controlled general assembly has shown no appetite for changing, prohibits local governments or others from “disturbing or interfering with” memorials to war veterans.The statute is at the center of a lawsuit playing out in Charlottesville over the effort to remove two Confederate statues in the aftermath of violent white nationalist demonstrations last August during which a counter-protester was killed. Those events and others in recent years, including the shooting dead of eight black churchgoers in Charleston in 2015, have prompted a national push for the removal of monuments and other symbols of the Confederacy, including the Confederate battle flag. Many cities, prominent among them New Orleans, have removed such statues from view. The Richmond report is not legally binding. Mayor Levar Stoney said in a statement he would study its recommendations further, though he said he agreed with the report’s finding that “something needs to change”. “Richmond has a long, complex and conflicted history and the Confederate statues on Monument Avenue represent a shameful part of our past,” Stoney said. When Stoney announced the commission, he said the statues should be supplemented with historical context about why they were built. After the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, he expanded the panel’s mandate.Many other US cities moved more quickly. Four monuments were hauled away in Baltimore – in Maryland, a border state that stayed in the union – days after the Charlottesville rally. In Memphis, Tennessee, city leaders used a legal loophole to get around a law protecting memorials by selling the parks where three statues to Confederate leaders stood. A not-for-profit removed the monuments, under the cover of darkness. In Kentucky, a panel formed in Louisville released a report on Saturday saying public displays honoring the Confederacy were unwelcome. The Richmond report suggested that part of the Davis monument could be relocated to his grave at Richmond’s Hollywood Cemetery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a5e931d9d2eb16a0ba797628c5e45874b8e73a/0_224_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2da7e85ef940d6ffcfebb5ee925c273","title":"amlo mexico president five things","story":"Mexico’s new leader writes books, is friendly with Jeremy Corbyn, and has more in common with Lula than TrumpCritics deride Andrés Manuel López Obrador – or Amlo as most call him – as Mexico’s “tropical messiah”. Others have painted him as a Donald Trump-style Latin American populist with a big ego and a distinctly dictatorial bent. Even some supporters admit they fret about Amlo’s authoritarian tendencies and whether he is truly a man of the left.But most analysts believe Amlo has more in common with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a pragmatic one-time union firebrand who led his country from 2002 until 2011. Like Amlo, Lula spent years trying to become president before succeeding at his fourth attempt.During his victory speech on Sunday night Amlo shed some light on how he plans to tackle perhaps the most urgent problem facing Mexico: the growing drug-related violence that this year has claimed an average of 88 lives per day. Amlo vowed to change the “failed strategy” his predecessors have used to tackle insecurity – a heavily militarized 11-year “war on drugs” which has claimed 200,000 lives. On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbsp“More than the use of force, we will deal with the causes from which insecurity and violence originate,” Amlo said. “I am convinced that the most effective and humane way of fighting these ills involves combating inequality and poverty. Peace and tranquility are fruits of the justice.”Amlo isn’t just Mexico’s new president – he’s also a bookworm and author with no fewer than 14 titles to his name. His tomes include Don’t Say Goodbye to Hope, The Mafia That Took Possession of Mexico and The Mafia That Robbed Us of the Presidency about his first failed presidential bid, in 2006.The book was recently published in English with the title: A New Hope for Mexico: Saying No to Corruption, Violence, and Trump’s Wall.Amlo’s friends include an influential British leftist: the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, with whom he reportedly spent part of his 2016 Christmas holiday.The pair are said to have met through Corbyn’s Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez, a former human rights layer who now runs a fair-trade coffee business in the UK. Corbyn, who has longstanding ties to Latin America, has spoken out against human rights abuses in Mexico and last week denounced the killing of more than 130 Mexican politicians during the election campaign.Amlo reportedly once gifted Corbyn a selection of jipi hats. “Jeremy loved them,” one member of Amlo’s campaign told the Times.Amlo’s political awakening is said to have come during the late 1970s when he worked as a representative of Mexico’s National Indigenous Institute in his native state of Tabasco.“He went to live in a shack just like the ones the indigenous families lived in,” José Agustín Ortiz Pinchetti recalls in a flattering new biography of his friend. During the six years he spent living with the Chontal Maya people, Amlo and his family slept in hammocks and endured “African temperatures of over 40C” with nothing but a single fan to keep them cool.“López Obrador took on that role as if it was his destiny, with a missionary’s spirit,” Pinchetti writes.

After the Singapore summit, Trump tweeted that: “There is no longer a nuclear threat” from North Korea, but in recent days, multiple leaks from the US intelligence assessment have suggested that the regime’s work on its nuclear and missile programme is not just continuing, but accelerating.The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that North Korea had expanded a factory for manufacturing solid fuel ballistic missiles in Hamhung, based on satellite imagery analysed by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) at Monterey, California. The Diplomat cited intelligence officials as saying Pyongyang was also continuing work on mobile launchers for one its latest generation of ballistic missiles. This follows a report by NBC News, also quoting multiple intelligence officials, saying that work had been stepped up at secret uranium enrichment sites. North Korea has acknowledged running one enrichment plant at its nuclear complex at Yongbyon. However, in 2010 US intelligence found a site at a place called Kangson which it believes to be a covert parallel site. A third site is said to have been discovered more recently. Officials from the Defence Intelligence Agency were quoted by CNN as saying they believe Kim has no intention of disarming, at least for the time being, and would seek to hide much of its programme.Pompeo is expected to present the Pyongyang leadership with a demand for a full inventory of its nuclear and missile programmes and then a timetable for dismantling them. Speaking to CBS News on Sunday, the national security adviser, John Bolton, said the US had a plan for full disarmament within a year.“I’m sure that secretary of state Mike Pompeo will be discussing this with the North Koreans in the near future about really how to dismantle all of their WMD and ballistic missile programs in a year,” Bolton told the programme Face the Nation.Most observers are sceptical that pace of disarmament is feasible even if Kim was willing to disarm, which they doubt.“It is unhelpful when Trump administration officials set arbitrary timelines for the denuclearisation process, which is going to be a long-term process that is going to require reciprocal US actions,” Kelsey Davenport, the director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control Association in Washington, said. “The speed at which North Korea is willing to take steps is dependent on what the US puts on the table in return.”“Kim has not said he would disarm at any point in this process,” said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation programme at MIIS. In Singapore, Kim signed a joint statement with Trump committed to “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, but that has been the North Korean position since 1992 and does not necessarily mean the regime is ready to disarm. “What it means to them is a formal process in which the US give up its nuclear weapons and then North Korea goes along,” Lewis said. “What we want is disarmament but we started using their phrase in the misguided belief it would cause them to get confused and give up their weapons by mistake.”Jim Walsh, an expert on the North Korean nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that North Korea’s total disarmament is the wrong benchmark to judge the success of diplomatic engagement.“Hey, I’d love to have denuclearisation. But it’s the wrong frame,” Walsh said. “The issue is whether we are safer or more insecure. Is a conflict that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons more likely or less likely?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e6252355ffba280c56c9779784bf37f9ad094e/0_376_7360_4416/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c2bbad650b56c0bdd12dadf50fdf49","title":"new koala gene map could help prevent extinction","story":"The research could be used to cure chlamydia in the marsupial, which can cause infertility The first comprehensive genetic map of the koala has unearthed valuable new information about the world-famous marsupial that scientists say will bolster efforts to save them from possible extinction.A consortium of 54 scientists from around the world came up with the genetic blueprint which sheds light on the marsupial’s diet as well as the population decline it has suffered as a result of urbanisation and disease.The researchers say their findings may aid work on a vaccine to protect koalas against one of their biggest killers – chlamydia – as well as help conservationists in efforts to protect their dwindling populations.“In the same the way that the human genome has revolutionised medicine for humans, to the point where you can have your genome sequenced and have your medicine tailor designed, then the idea is that this could be possible for koalas,” said lead researcher Prof Rebecca Johnson, of the Australian Museum.Using a supercomputer at the University of NSW, the scientists sequenced more than 20,000 koala genes and came up with a genome slightly larger than its human counterpart.Their work revealed information about how the koala survives on a diet of toxic eucalyptus leaves, the impact of chlamydia on their immune system, the protective properties in a mother koala’s milk, their population ersity in different parts of Australia and evolution.Koala numbers have plunged in northern Australia since European settlement but increased in parts of Victoria and South Australia.Conservationists say the uneven spread is part of the problem in trying to manage the koala population, which is estimated to have fallen to about 329,000. Chlamydia can cause infertility in females, blindness and the widespread retrovirus, an AIDS-like virus about which little is known.The research found that many different types of the retrovirus have been inserted more than 100 times in the koala genome, and new light was shed on the particular gene categories related to the development of chlamydia.Johnson said the information could help scientists work out which forms of retrovirus were most dangerous in koalas as well as why some were resistant to chlamydia – information that could inform work on vaccines for both conditions.“Vaccines for both are in development, which is pretty critical because chlamydia is pretty debilitating in some parts of the koala population,” she said.The study also discovered koalas have high levels of a type of enzyme in their livers that allows them to survive on eucalyptus leaves toxic to most other animals.Koala populations in NSW and Queensland were also found for the first time to have significant levels of genetic ersity.“Ensuring this genetic ersity is conserved in concert with other conservation measures to protect habitat, reduce vehicle strikes, dog attacks and disease, are the keys to the long-term survival of the koala,” Johnson said.The findings were published online by the journal Nature Genetics on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75df84081f7703bac9f9ef6ebce0eefdfb97a305/0_19_5216_3128/master/5216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c05fcbea094d002ed9b1ceaf662874b8","title":"uk to appoint lgbt health adviser national action plan","story":"Theresa May promises ‘real and lasting change’ following huge nationwide surveyThe government will appoint a national LGBT health adviser and take measures to end so-called conversion therapy as part of a plan to deliver what Theresa May has promised will be “real and lasting change”.The proposals form part of an action plan published by the Equalities Office on Tuesday. It follows a UK-wide survey of LGBT people that had more than 108,000 responses, billed as the largest study of its kind.The 30-page plan contains a series of pledges, including to improve the police response to LGBT hate incidents, more support for LGBT students and teachers and improvements to gender identity services for transgender adults.The proposals, which will receive an initial £4.5m in funding, were welcomed by the campaign groups Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation.Ruth Hunt, Stonewall’s chief executive, said she was “really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT people who responded to this survey”.The online poll, which ran from July to October last year, sought views from LGBT and intersex people about their personal experiences and interactions with public services.In comments released with the plan, the prime minister said the survey had highlighted where more efforts were needed.“I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction,” May said.The plan promises to end these practices, with the Equalities Office to look into various legislative or non-legislative ways to do so.The techniques, sometimes called “cure” therapies, are based on the idea that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is a mental complaint that can be reversed. They are often modelled on mainstream methods of psychotherapy, and sometimes prayer, and are known to be harmful.One man who underwent such a process and then took part in sessions to “cure” him said the experience left him suicidal. He told ITV News he underwent a combination of confession and prayers, supposedly to rid him of a gay “demon”.He then took part in sessions for others, but became depressed and prayed to die. “I wanted God to remove me from the world to lessen my suffering and to lessen the suffering of those around me,” he said.“At the time I believed this was a demon being cast out of me. And I remember the next day waking up and thinking, I don’t really know what that means now. Does it mean I’m a straight man now? Is that demon gone? Did that demon really exist?”Penny Mordaunt, the minister for women and equalities, said: “Our action plan is a step towards everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, being able to live safe, happy and healthy lives where they can be themselves without fear of discrimination.”May is to host the annual Downing Street LGBT Pride reception on Tuesday evening. Among the guests for the first time will be Peter Tatchell. The veteran campaigner said May had invited him after he was “banned” previously.In a separate statement, Tatchell called the action plan a “welcome start”, but said it fell short on issues such as the deportation of LGBT refugees to countries where homophobia was widespread. The £4.5m budget was “derisory and insulting”, he added.Paul Martin, the chief executive of the LGBT Foundation, said his organisation had worked with the Equalities Office on the survey and he was “delighted that the government has listened”.The study and announcement are separate to government plans to amend the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, making the process by which transgender people can change their legal gender easier. A consultation on this is to begin soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b3025b2b76b0e67586ff22acb1761b05061c3c3/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e176b2332bd4d882a8e0e2a6e687503","title":"amlo wins mexico election in pictures","story":"Supporters of the Juntos Haremos Historia (Together We Will Make History) presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, – fill Zócalo square in central Mexico City to celebrate his dramatic election victory.

Photograph: David JonesPAA reader named Paul Davy got in touch because he wanted us to know about what he called Sky’s Hotel California policy, a policy which, he says, means “you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave”.He has spent much of the past 12 months trying to cancel his Sky broadband account to no avail so far and in his mail he promises a “quick” version of the story but – to be honest – it is not at all quick so you might want to settle in.“I was approached by an eir salesman in May 2017 as they were installing fibre in our remote area of Co Galway and he advised that if we didn’t sign up with eir we’d be waiting more than two years for Sky fibre,” his story starts.Davy says he found the salesman “a bit pushy”, and having had Sky TV for eight years and its broadband for around three years “albeit with miserable download speeds” he decided to contact\u0026nbspSky before he signed with eir.He did that on May 25th last year “and they confirmed I was out of contract but also advised that if my neighbours were getting fibre from eir then there was no reason that Sky couldn’t provide me with fibre – more or less rubbishing what the eir salesman had told me,” he says.So he renewed his contract with Sky “on the clear understanding that what they were telling me was correct”, he says.“I can still hear myself spelling that out as a condition of renewal and Sky reconfirming that if my neighbours have fibre I’ll have fibre through Sky. I was even willing to wait one or two months for the fibre.”He never got his fibre. He called Sky “a few times” over the next few months, each time giving them a history of events, and each time he says he was given conflicting information.Last September a Sky agent confirmed the company couldn’t provide fibre in his\u0026nbsparea “as eir had pulled in new lines to my neighbours and hadn’t released them yet to other providers. As I was running a home office on still miserable download\u0026nbspspeeds I cancelled Sky broadband and phone that day”, Davy says.He was, however, persuaded to keep the TV package with the promise of a discount. Then he signed up for eir fibre and phone and the Sky agent confirmed that he would send the cancellation request to the relevant department.He got his eir fibre installed a few days later “without any hassle”, and all was well. Then he realised Sky were still taking the full amount of direct debit out of his account when they should have only be charging him for his discounted TV package.He contacted Sky again on October 6th. An agent confirmed his cancellation had not been processed but she said she would contact the Cancellation Department and ring him back that day. The agent did not call back that day but he missed a call from her the following day “and she left a message to say she’d call me the following Wednesday – four days later”.The call came as promised. The agent said there would be an early disconnection charge as I was cancelling “in contract”. Davy disputed this and asked for transcripts of his calls with Sky to prove his case.“The forms I was supposed to sign requesting the transcripts never arrived and I let it slip for a while as I was very busy in work and didn’t have time during the day to be still following this up,” he says.Then in early January “with full direct debits still going out to Sky” he spoke to another agent and went through the story again.Time passed and he contacted Sky again as the transcript request form wanted him to submit £10 (sterling) when returning it. The company confirmed they’d sent out the wrong form and that he shouldn’t have to pay anything and that they would send out a new transcript form in the post.“I finally got the transcripts in the post toward the end of February 2018 but it came in the form of 40 pages of every transaction and call in Excel format, a hard copy of emails sent to me and a CD Rom – hello – who still has a CD player on their laptop in this day and age? I mean Sky can reboot your TV from India so you think they could email me the call recordings? I also had to call Sky again as the form requested €5 this time – I was told that I was misinformed and that there was a €5 fee but if I paid it that Sky would credit me for same.”Again Davy let it slip for a spell as he was very busy in work “and needed to source an old laptopPC with a CD player. But when I finally did source one last weekend, the security ‘passphrase’ they emailed me separately to open the CD did not work. I’ll be contacting them yet again today advising of same, but either way I know I renewed in good faith on the basis that Sky could offer me fibre like eir.”Apart from the efforts to get the transcripts he has also contacted Sky on numerous occasions to cancel his broadband and having been as polite as humanly possible all along, “on one occasion I finally lost it a little when pitted against an alpha male supervisor who had raised the tone of our conversation to a higher level, when I uttered the words \u0027get your head out of your ass for a minute\u0027\u0026nbspit was duly followed by \u0027I’m now terminating this call\u0027. I mean I work in construction and that’s about the least vulgar thing you can say to someone in conversation,” he says.“On another occasion I was told I could only cancel Sky exactly a month before the renewal date and not before. So I did ring Sky on 25th April 2018, someone in the Cancellation Department listened to my summary of the whole fiasco and confirmed that she’d process the cancellation herself, do a follow-up on the 14th May 2018 to make sure it went through and also confirmed when I asked the question that \u0027nothing can go wrong\u0027\u0026nbspwith it this time”.“He did call back 10 minutes later and promised to sort things out within the Cancellation Department and call me back later that day. I haven’t heard anything from anyone in Sky since and am beginning to think that this is some kind of sick game that the Sky Cancellation Department play on people or maybe it’s just with me.”He says what he would like is the cancellation of his broadband, a refund of his money, and “an official apology from Sky to acknowledge that you can’t treat people like this and you can’t continually give them misinformation depending on what operator they’re talking to”.He also said he would like “compensation for the wasted hours on the phone where you’ve got to psych yourself up to make the call in the first place, go through their voice recorded options, utter the words “Cancel Broadband” for the umpteenth time when they ask you to clearly describe how they can help you today, relay your life story to another poor unfortunate Sky operator who you know sympathises with you but are only doing their job and probably have another 10 or 20 Paul Davys to listen to after your call finishes”.We got in touch with the company and received the following statement.“Having investigated the case highlighted we wish to apologise to the affected customer. We pride ourselves on providing customers with a high standard of customer service and acknowledge that the customer’s experience in this instance did not meet those standards. We have reached out to the customer and have resolved this matter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality   June 30, 2018LGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protest   July 2, 2018None more gloriously cynical about creeping commercialisation than LGBT+ community "},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s hosepipe ban everything you need to know","story":"Irish Water have introduced a hosepipe ban in the Greater Dublin Region. What does that mean? What is covered? How long will it last? And how will it be enforced?The month-long ban was introduced on Monday, to last until at least July 31st, at which point it may be extended.The ban prohibits people using their garden hose, with a few minor exceptions. People will not be allowed to use a hosepipe to water their garden or potted plants, wash their car or boat, or fill a paddling pool, pond, or water fountain.People can still water their garden and plants using a watering can, and fill a paddling pool with buckets of water filled from the tap. The hosepipe ban on filling ponds does not apply if there is fish in the garden pond. The ban is in place 247 for the next month.At the moment the hosepipe ban is only in place across the wider Dublin region. Irish Water has included as parts of counties Wicklow and Kildare in the Greater Dublin Region area ban.It said there are more than 100 other areas across the country at risk of water shortages, where it is considering a hosepipe ban to conserve supply.Decisions to extend the ban to other areas are likely, but will be considered on a scheme by scheme basis. In the meantime night time water restrictions are in place across several parts of the country, to help conserve supply.In the south of the country 27 local water schemes have been severely affected by drought, including parts of Kilkenny, Carlow, Waterford, Limerick and Kerry.People can report their neighbours or anyone they see breaking the ban. A tip line to report excessive water use is available at 1850 278 278.The water utility said they have added additional staff to man the phone line over the next month. The phone line can also be used to ask staff general water conservation queries.A spokeswoman from Irish Water said staff would follow up on reports, and take actions where they found “excessive and continuous usage” of water.If Irish Water deem someone has committed an offence in breaching the conservation order, they can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they do not pay within 21 days.Legislation allowing Irish Water to introduce a hosepipe ban is covered under the Water Services Act 2000, which gives the utility the power in cases of “serious deficiency” of water supply.Irish Water have introduced the restrictions in Dublin as demand for water is outstripping how much the utility can supply.The greater Dublin water schemes can produce 610 million litres of treated water a day. Currently nearly all of that is being used, since the heatwave started.This is compared to an average 565m litres a day used over the summer last year.During the peak of the heatwave in the second half of last week, up to 615m litres a day was being drawn down in Dublin.The exceptionally high temperatures over the last week have also led to dropping water levels in lakes and rivers, and the dry weather has also meant a lack of rain.Water reserves are being stretched to the limit, with the Pollaphuca reservoir on the Liffey being drained so quickly it may have knock on effects for water supply later in the summer, and even into the autumn, Irish Water have said.At the moment the conservation order is in place for the month on July. A spokeswoman for Irish Water said they will “continue to monitor all water supplies and will provide updates if any extension is required.”“We have a collective community responsibility for the conservation of water, as they do in other countries when a hosepipe ban is in place,” the spokeswoman said.Irish Water have also called on people to take steps to conserve the amount of water they use generally.People are being asked to take showers instead of baths, and to take shorter showers. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, and only run the dishwasher and washing machine on full loads.If watering your plants with a watering can, Irish Water said people should do so in the early morning or evening, to limit evaporation.When it comes to flushing the toilet, Irish Water’s conservation advice is to “let the yellow mellow,” as flushing the toilet is one of the biggest uses of water in the household. People are being asked to “consider only flushing the toilet when you really need to,” the utility have said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550184.1530459659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"just three nurses recruited this year for hse relocation package","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, there were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551582.1530560444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"remote ivf allows use of anonymous donor eggs without travel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnonymous sperm and egg donation is expected to be banned in Ireland, once the Minister for Health commences enactment of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Children and Family Relationships Act, which allows for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction.  File image: PAIrish women undergoing fertility treatment can now avail of anonymously donated eggs for use in IVF without having to travel abroad, according to an international clinic which has facilities in Ireland. The Institut Marquès, which has clinics in Dublin and Clane, Co Kildare, says it has developed a new programme which will allow patients to avoid travelling and to “remotely” carry out IVF with donor eggs. The institute is to present the initial results of its “distance oocyte donation” (DOD) programme at the 2018 conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona on Tuesday.Anonymous sperm and egg donation is expected to be banned in Ireland, once the Minister for Health commences enactment of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Children and Family Relationships Act, which allows for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction. A ban on anonymous donation is in place in many countries including the UK.Explaining its new programme, Institut Marquès director Dr Marisa López-Teijón said “cross border reproductive treatment” could be stressful for patients. With DOD, “it’s the embryo that travels. This method offers a safe, efficient and comfortable option to carry out treatment in the patient’s country of origin”.The semen sample of the male partner is frozen at the country of origin such as Ireland and sent to its laboratory in Barcelona, where IVF is carried out with the donor’s fresh eggs. Once fertilised, embryos are vitrified (frozen) on their fifth day of development and sent back to Ireland so embryo transfer can be carried out by the patient’s own doctor in her country of origin.The programme has achieved a pregnancy rate of 65 per cent by embryo transfer a “live born baby rate” of 52 per cent, a miscarriage rate “only 12.6 per cent and multiple pregnancy rate goes down to 0.9 per cent”. This is based on 215 IVF “cycles” carried out at its Livet facility in Italy. Prof Deirdre Madden, an expert in medical ethics at UCC, pointed out egg donation was not prohibited by Irish law currently, which suggested the programme could be a consequence of difficulties in sourcing suitable egg donors here.A lot of countries had egg shortages as generating them involved an invasive procedure including use of ovary stimulation drugs, and was not as easy as sperm donation, she said. In relation to Ireland, “it’s less about the law and more about getting eggs. There is nothing preventing having the egg procedure done here”, she said.There was a lack of legal clarity on two fronts, however: a three-year delay on implementing relevant parts of the Children and Family Relationships Act and the fact that the 2017 Assisted Reproduction Bill had yet to be fully adopted, she said.The latter is expected to regulate a range of practices including gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for assisted human reproduction and provides for an independent regulatory authority.The Irish Fertility Society has expressed strong opposition to the proposed ban on anonymous donation and the creation of a register that would allow donor-conceived children obtain personal family information once they turn 18.The society, which represents clinics, consultants and scientists working in the sector, claimed women using fertility treatment to get pregnant would be driven abroad or into “private arrangements with men on the internet” if the anonymity ban and donor register went ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Patients will be able to \u0026lsquoremotely\u0026rsquo carry out IVF with donor egg, says companyIreland has been without a US ambassador since Trump came to office at the start of 2017Modern technology and social media has led to huge increase in material that must be disclosed at trialDublin consumption peaked last week at 50 million litres above normal levelsSenior Fianna F\u0026aacuteil figures believe Varadkar is keeping option of autumn election openTaoiseach says important for Ireland to have a place where \u0026lsquoimportant decisions are made\u0026rsquoPassengers on 46a route among those who will be forced to get two buses instead of oneMay says \u0026lsquosome real differences\u0026rsquo remain between UK and European Commission around BorderHealth professionals warn of sunburn and sunstroke as country sizzles in the heatJudge praises \u0026lsquocourage\u0026rsquo of young man and woman who came to aid of seriously injured friendIssues concerning handling of widow\u0026rsquos estate by Declan O\u0026rsquoCallaghan were \u0026lsquodisquieting\u0026rsquoTaoiseach\u0026rsquos criticism based on \u0026lsquofalse facts and inaccurate jabber published in the papers\u0026rsquoLower salaries for newer employees has \u0026lsquopoisoned morale\u0026rsquo and led to staff shortagesTaoiseach rejects claims of complacency by Minister of State Finian McGrathCourt of Appeal hears hospital was concerned discharge was not in best interests of 93-year-oldDespite \u0026lsquoslowly improving picture\u0026rsquo, Northern Ireland Water renews calls to conserveNew network will see more changes of bus for some trips"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551477.1530552756!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no end to the heatwave in sight says met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEnjoying the good weather at the Forty Foot, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on Monday.

He had decided not to attend before the recent controversy over the children of migrants, his office said.A spokeswoman for the co-leaders of the Social Democrats, Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy, said that both had been invited, but neither would be going. She said the issue about which they were most concerned was the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the US border.Sinn Féin did not respond to queries about leader Mary Lou McDonald’s attendance at the event.A Fine Gael spokesman said TDs had not been offered any guidance on the event.A spokesman for the Minister for Children Katherine Zappone (who is originally from the US) said she would not be attending as she has Dáil and constituency business on Tuesday evening.Ireland has been without a US ambassador since Donald Trump came to office at the beginning of 2017 and dismissed all Obama administration appointees. The Department of Foreign Affairs does not expect an appointment this year.An intention to appoint Irish American businessman Brian Burns to the post was abandoned last year after Mr Burns withdrew owing to health concerns.In the American system the embassies are staffed by civil servants from the State Department, but the ambassador is a political appointment which usually goes to supporters and fundraisers for the incumbent president. In the absence of an ambassador in the embassy in Ballsbridge, the event on Tuesday is being hosted by Reece Smyth, the deputy chief of the US mission.A spokesman for the US embassy declined to comment on any acceptances or refusals.

Photograph: John MacDougallAFPGetty ImagesChancellor Angela Merkel and her Bavarian allies have agreed fast-track camps for asylum seekers on Germany’s border with Austria to reduce asylum seeker numbers and salvage their political alliance in Berlin.The agreement for closed asylum centres came during a final meeting on Monday evening to prevent Bavaria’s Christian Social Union (CSU) implementing controls on German borders against Dr Merkel’s wishes.“We agreed after very intense negotiations,” said Horst Seehofer, CSU leader and federal interior minister in Berlin. “This is a clear agrement to prevent illegal immigration in future on the German-Austrian border.”The three-week disagreement between the CSU and Dr Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) escalated late on Sunday evening when Mr Seehofer offered his resignation. On Monday evening he indicated he would stay on in his job, saying it “was worthwhile fighting for one’s convictions”.Dr Merkel welcomed the deal as a “good compromise”.On Monday afternoon she told a joint CDUCSU parliamentary party she was anxious to hold together their 69 year-old alliance saying: “There is a great wish to solve this.”Both centre-right leaders said the deal had avoided a rupture of their parliamentary alliance, and the Bavarians’ departure from government, which would leave Dr Merkel short of a Bundestag majority.The Social Democratic Party (SPD), the third party in Dr Merkel’s coalition, signalled it could back transit zone camps – an idea it ruled out in 2015.Last month Mr Seehofer presented a 63-point “migration masterplan” to combat illegal immigration but one point fell foul of the chancellor: proposals to refuse entry to migrants already refused asylum or registered elsewhere in the EU.As the standoff escalated on Monday afternoon, he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung daily: “I won’t allow myself be fired by a chancellor who’s only chancellor because of me.”His remark was an allusion to last year’s federal election, in which stronger CSU results helped salvage the CDU’s worst postwar election result.Mr Seehofer’s chief CSU rival, Markus Söder, the Bavarian state premier and until now a hardline force in the migrant row with the CDU, struck a remarkably conciliatory tone by comparison.There was, he said, “no question” of the Bavarians endangering their parliamentary partnership or Germany’s grand coalition.“Cancelling a parliamentary party alliance is not the right path,” said Mr Söder. “We can achieve a lot in government but not from outside.”While the CSU attacks have rallied CDU MPs to her support, Dr Merkel struggled in recent days to reconcile her insistence on European agreement on migration issues with CSU demands for unilateral border checks.Last week the CSU put her under the gun to produce “equivalent” EU proposals to border closures. After an all-night session in Brussels, she returned with a political agreement to tighten the exterior EU borders, as well as centralised asylum centres and bilateral refugee return deals.But these measures were dismissed as aspirational by the CSU and, after a failed mediation effort on Monday chaired by Bundestag president Wolfgang Schäuble, Dr Merkel and Mr Seehofer joined their respective teams for another long night of talks.The unprecedented crisis in Germany’s centre-right – with potential shock waves for the entire continent – has left even seasoned political observers perplexed.“This is collective leadership failure . . . with no trust for the future and no goodwill,” said Prof Karl-Rudolf Korte, political scientist at the University of Duisburg-Essen.He told German public television the crisis had damaged the chancellor “no longer at the peak of her power but at the end”.Looking on at her coalition partners’ three-week meltdown, Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Andrea Nahles warned her that “patience is running thin”.Speculation that the chancellor could bring in a new partner to replace the CSU has shifted attention to the most likely choice: the Green Party.“We are always open to talks,” said Green co-leader Robert Habeck, “but I’m extremely sceptical about a fresh start after the chaos of the last days.”Other opposition parties could barely contain their Schadenfreude at the perilous state of Dr Merkel’s alliance.“Any regular citizen who carried out their job like this would be rid of it in a flash,” said Dr Sahra Wagenknecht, Bundestag co-leader of the Left Party."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551498.1530553827!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russian world cup joy contrasts with gloom over living standards","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKing Felipe VI of Spain, Fifa president Gianni Infantino and Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev at the World Cup match between Spain and Russia in Moscow. Photograph: Dmitry AstakhovSputnikEPAWhen Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev blocked Spain’s final strike in a penalty shoot-out on Sunday, it seemed as if not just the cavernous Luzhniki Stadium but the whole of Moscow was exploding with joy.Car horns sounded from far and wide, while whoops of joy emanated from apartment blocks where city dwellers, glued to their television screens indoors on one of the hottest days of the year, had been braced for a humiliating defeat by the Spanish.Russia has been basking in the glory of hosting what Fifa has described as one of the best World Cups ever organised. Sunday’s unexpected win came as a massive boost to national morale at a time when many Russians were downcast about the growing hardships of daily life.Tough economic reforms announced by the authorities just before the World Cup have stoked resentment in Russia despite the distraction of the football. Even Vladimir Putin, known as the “Teflon president” for his ability to avoid public criticism, has seen his high approval ratings take a knock.Security regulations banning demonstrations in World Cup host cities will shield foreign football fans from witnessing spectacles of public discontent that might otherwise have cast a shadow over the tournament. But thousands took to the streets in other Russian cities at the weekend to protest against a government move to reform the pension system that is widely seen here as daylight robbery.Demonstrators also vented their anger about other recent painful economic measures, from an increase in VAT to higher petrol and utilities costs.Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, submitted a Bill to parliament in early June that, if backed by lawmakers, will postpone the retirement age for men to 65 years from 60 years in phases over the coming 10 years. Russian women will have to wait until they are 63 to collect their pensions, a full eight years longer than at present.Various groups have been exempted from the changes, including workers in Russia’s harsh far north, mothers who have more than five children and carers of invalids. Other more privileged iniduals, such as Russian state prosecutors and federal security agents, will retain the right to early retirement.Russian pensions, on average about 14,000 roubles (€190) per month, are not exactly generous. But liberal economists say that, with an ageing population, Russia cannot afford to delay an overhaul of the system that weighs so heavily on the federal budget.Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner, says the proposed measures amount to the “theft of tens of millions of people under the guise of overdue reforms”. Money to pay pensions would be better found by forcing Russian corporations to pay idends and halting the misuse of government funds, he says.It’s not only the political opposition that is kicking up a fuss.Large Russian trade unions that are usually loyal to the Kremlin helped organise some of the weekend protests and are promising more action in the weeks ahead.Various opinion polls indicate that the overwhelming majority of the Russian population are against any delay to pensions that would depress already low living standards.In a survey last week, the Levada Center said the prospect of a delayed retirement age was adding to Russians’ gloom about their economic prospects and undermining confidence in the authorities.Some 58 per cent of respondents said the government was not “in a condition to change the position of the country for the better”. Putin’s approval ratings, which were cruising at about 80 per cent when he won a fourth presidential term in a March election, have sunk 15 per cent over the past month.Kremlin critics have accused the authorities of timing the announcement of unpopular reforms with the World Cup in the hope that the tournament would distract public attention.Russia’s defeat of Spain could embolden the authorities to inflict even more pain on the long-suffering population, joked Sergei Udaltsov, co-leader of the Russian Left Front opposition movement. “There’s a risk now that the government will abolish pensions altogether and introduce a 12-hour working day,” he tweeted on Monday.Putin’s packed working schedule prevented him from attending Sunday’s match at the Luzhniki Stadium, according to the Kremlin. Instead Medvedev turned up in the VIP stalls and sat looking glumly uneasy through most of the game, as if braced for an inevitable defeat.Putin has also remained absent from public discussion of the pension reforms, leaving Medvedev to take the flak.Many commentators believe that once the World Cup is over, the Russian president will enter the fray and reprimand the government for bungling. Some officials may lose their jobs, but pension reforms, even if they are modified in some way, are probably here to stay.Russia 2018: All the teams, all the games, all the news here."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551501.1530554138!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may calls on eu to show more flexibility in brexit negotiations","story":"British Prime Minister gives a statement on Brexit in the House of Commons.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesTheresa May has called on the European Union to show more flexibility in negotiations over Brexit, warning that parliament would reject the withdrawal agreement unless it was accompanied by clarity on a future trading relationship.Updating MPs on last week’s European Council meeting, the British prime minister said a White Paper to be published next week would set out “detailed proposals for a sustainable and close future relationship” between Britain and the EU.“I warned EU leaders that I did not think this parliament would approve the withdrawal agreement in the autumn unless we had clarity about our future relationship alongside it,” she said.“The EU and its member states will want to consider our proposals seriously. We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left that is in the interests of both our peoples.”Ms May has called her cabinet to an all-day meeting at Chequers on Friday to agree a common position on key issues surrounding Brexit, including customs and Britain’s future relationship with the single market. Downing Street on Monday declined to comment on reports that the prime minister had a new proposal for the customs relationship after Brexit.Earlier, Conservative ministers and backbenchers rounded on Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg after he warned the prime minister that she risked splitting her party as Robert Peel did over the Corn Laws in the middle of the 19th century.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that his fellow Brexiteers in the backbench European Research Group (ERG) would vote against the final exit deal if Ms May abandoned her negotiating red lines.“Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed MPs would vote against such propositions in parliament,” he wrote.Foreign office minister Alan Duncan said Mr Rees-Mogg risked debasing “government, party, country and himself” by his insolence in lecturing and threatening the prime minister.“The PM must be given maximum latitude and backing,” Sir Alan tweeted. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Backbench MP Simon Hoare accused Mr Rees-Mogg of hectoring and blackmail and warned that he risked opening the way to a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn. Another backbencher, Vicky Ford, said there was no majority in parliament for the hard Brexiteers’ vision of Brexit.“If this becomes a binary choice between staying in the single market and customs union or no deal, then I do not believe there is a majority for no deal,” she told the BBC.On Monday evening, foreign secretary Boris Johnson offered support for Mr Rees-Mogg in a complimentary tweet.“It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit. Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This would ease the constraints the crippling cost of living places on their ability to build a better life and ensure everyone can reach a decent standard of living.Junior football team found by British ers could remain stuck in Thai cave for monthsThailand cave rescue: Meet the heroic volunteer British ers who are the best in the world\u0026#39Pint scam\u0026#39 as major restaurant chain caught serving beer in special glasses 8.1ml too smallAngela Merkel\u0026#39s coalition rebel Horst Seehofer left out in the coldPerfect World Cup prophecies not enough to save Japan’s  ‘psychic octopus’ from the dinner table Women freeze their eggs to allow men to get ahead in their careersNational measles warning after five-fold rise in cases in England Outrage at photos of American woman posing with giraffe she shot dead in South Africa Targets and \u0026#39blame culture\u0026#39 stop older people getting proper careMoD must not become a \u0026#39jobs club\u0026#39, Johnny Mercer says as he calls for reform of Britain\u0026#39s armed forces Lopez Obrador suggests deal with Trump: American support for jobs and development in Mexico, to reduce migration to USHow Mexico\u0026#39s borderlands swung towards Leftist Lopez Obrador to seal his victoryWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

Indeed, Mexicans joke that “AMLO”, as he\u0027s known, mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 and a household name, has been campaigning for the presidency for 18 years.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Mexico\u0026#039s Jeremy Corbyn to battle \u0026#039the mafia of power\u0026#039“It’s a triumph for all the world, all the people,” he told his fans, gathered outside his home in the early hours of Monday. “It’s of millions and millions who are fed up with this regime of corruption and privilege, and who decided today to vote for a real change.“I’m going to do it. I won’t fail you.”Jose Antonio Meade, 49, candidate for the ruling PRI, conceded defeat with lightning speed, announcing shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he had lost.An experienced and well-respected politician, he was severely handicapped by representing the party of despised President Enrique Pena Nieto.Jose Antonio Meade gives a thumbs up after voting on Sunday. He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policyJunior football team found by British ers could remain stuck in Thai cave for monthsThailand cave rescue: Meet the heroic volunteer British ers who are the best in the world\u0026#39Pint scam\u0026#39 as major restaurant chain caught serving beer in special glasses 8.1ml too smallAngela Merkel\u0026#39s coalition rebel Horst Seehofer left out in the coldPerfect World Cup prophecies not enough to save Japan’s  ‘psychic octopus’ from the dinner table Women freeze their eggs to allow men to get ahead in their careersNational measles warning after five-fold rise in cases in England Outrage at photos of American woman posing with giraffe she shot dead in South Africa Families need £40,000 a year for a decent standard of livingTargets and \u0026#39blame culture\u0026#39 stop older people getting proper careMoD must not become a \u0026#39jobs club\u0026#39, Johnny Mercer says as he calls for reform of Britain\u0026#39s armed forces Lopez Obrador suggests deal with Trump: American support for jobs and development in Mexico, to reduce migration to USHow Mexico\u0026#39s borderlands swung towards Leftist Lopez Obrador to seal his victoryWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

Despite losing to the Poles, Japan advanced courtesy of the fact that its players had received fewer cautions during the three group stage games. Rabiot’s uncanny knack of correctly picking Japan’s results made the creature a national sensation, with day-time chat shows lining up to report its latest prognostications.  Jan Vertonghen (R) of Belgium vies with Hiroki Sakai of Japan during the 2018 FIFA World Cup round of 16 match between Belgium and Japan“I was happy that Japan was able to qualify for the knock-out stages”, Mr Abe told the Mainichi newspaper, although the octopus’ run of form had not been enough to save it.Concluding that his business was more important than Rabiot’s predictions, Mr Abe said Rabiot had been “shipped” - a euphemism for gutted and sold.Fans of the psychic octopus reacted with stoicism, with one Twitter user messaging “Rabiot, sayonara” and another adding “I hope you end up in something really delicious”. Rabiot follows in the tentacle prints of Paul the so-called \u0026#34octopus oracle\u0026#34 who predicted results of the 2010 World CupMr Abe brought in a substitute octopus ahead of the first match in the knockout stage of the tournament, saying, “I hope the second Rabiot will also predict all the outcomes correctly and that Japan will go all the way”. Those hopes were dashed when Belgium rallied from being 2-0 down with just over 20 minutes to play in Rostov-on-Don to win 3-2. It is not known whether the replacement octopus predicted the result correctly, although it is certain that it will meet a similar fate to Rabiot. Junior football team found by British ers could remain stuck in Thai cave for monthsThailand cave rescue: Meet the heroic volunteer British ers who are the best in the world\u0026#39Pint scam\u0026#39 as major restaurant chain caught serving beer in special glasses 8.1ml too smallAngela Merkel\u0026#39s coalition rebel Horst Seehofer left out in the coldWomen freeze their eggs to allow men to get ahead in their careersNational measles warning after five-fold rise in cases in England Outrage at photos of American woman posing with giraffe she shot dead in South Africa Families need £40,000 a year for a decent standard of livingTargets and \u0026#39blame culture\u0026#39 stop older people getting proper careMoD must not become a \u0026#39jobs club\u0026#39, Johnny Mercer says as he calls for reform of Britain\u0026#39s armed forces Lopez Obrador suggests deal with Trump: American support for jobs and development in Mexico, to reduce migration to USHow Mexico\u0026#39s borderlands swung towards Leftist Lopez Obrador to seal his victoryWhat\u0026#39s in a name?

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love.“We can be proud that the UK is a world leader in advancing LGBT+ rights, but the overwhelming response to our survey has shone a light on the many areas where we can improve the lives of LGBT+ people.”While describing the plan as a “welcome start”, including the proposals on conversion therapy, the prominent LGBT+ campaigner Peter Tatchell, who is due to attend a Downing Street Pride reception on Tuesday, said it fell short on key issues such as the deportation of LGBT+ refugees and described a £4.5m fund in the plan as “derisory and insulting”.“The biggest fail is the lack of any pledge to end the detention and deportation of LGBT+ refugees fleeing persecution in violently homophobic countries like Uganda, Iran, Russia, Egypt and Jamaica,” he said.He continued: “Another big omission is the absence of any commitment to compensate gay and bisexual men who were convicted under past anti-gay laws.

Attitudes have changed but there are still pockets of society where we’re far from safe.She continued: “We’re really pleased that the government is listening to the thousands upon thousands of LGBT+ people who responded to this survey and are investing funds in areas where LGBT+ people face some of the harsher inequalities, such as health care.“We now need people in all of Britain’s communities to also come out for LGBT+ equality and to stand up against the hate and abuse we face daily.Labour’s shadow equalities minister, Dawn Butler, said she was “glad “ the government was paying more attention to LGBT+ issues, but added: “Much of this plan is yet more reviews and consultations”.She continued: “Cruel and inhumane conversion therapies have been allowed to spread fear and hatred in our society for far too long. Unfortunately, this report does not commit to legislative change. We call on the government to bring forward legislation which proposes nothing short of a full ban.“With one in five LGBT+ people experiencing a hate crime in the last year, we are disappointed that the government has not met Labour’s call to make these crimes an aggravated offence, the same as hate crimes based on race and faith.“It’s exasperating to see the government reannounce an announcement they made a year ago about consulting on the Gender Recognition Act. Labour is calling for the Act to be updated to ensure greater protections for trans people, and we urge Theresa May to finally work with us to make it law.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that.

Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

The planet is roughly three\u0026nbspbillion kilometres from the central star, about the same as the distance between Uranus and the Sun.The dark region that can be seen in the middle of the photo is because of\u0026nbspa coronagraph –\u0026nbspa mask that blocks the blinding light of the central star and allows astronomers to detect its much fainter disc and planetary companion. It is that mask that allows the planet to be formed, since otherwise the bright light of the star would overwhelm any light coming from the planet itself.These discs around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, but so far only a handful of observations have detected hints of baby planets in them, said\u0026nbspMiriam Keppler, who led the team who found the still-forming planet. The problem is that until now, most of these planet candidates could just have been features in the disc.As the first planet for scientists to get a confirmed view of,\u0026nbspPDS 70b will serve as a useful test of theories about how planets come to exist.

The meeting came days before a massive leak of DNC emails that has been connected to Russia.Mr Comey was fired from his post as head of the FBI by President Donald Trump. The timing of Mr Comey\u0027s firing raised questions around whether or not the FBI\u0027s investigation into the Trump campaign may have played a role in the decision.Mr Bahara refused, alongside 46 other US district attorney\u0027s across the country, to resign once President Donald Trump took office after previous assurances from Mr Trump that he would keep his job.Ms Yates, a former Deputy Attorney General, was running the Justice Department while President Donald Trump\u0027s pick for attorney general awaited confirmation.

And as you can see, President Putin agreed.”\u0026nbspRussia\u0027s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is likely to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo within the next two weeks as part of efforts to set the stage for the summit.\u0026nbspMr Ryabkov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies on Thursday that Moscow has already made a proposal regarding the specifics of the meeting and is waiting for Washington\u0027s answer.Nato\u0026nbspSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg\u0026nbspwelcomed the meeting, saying that\u0026nbspNato\u0027s approach to Russia is one of defence and but also dialogue“It\u0027s absolutely, totally in line with Nato\u0026nbsppolicies to talk to Russia, to meet with Russian leaders.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Faith groups were responsible for half the instances.The action plan promises: We will act so that LGBT people feel safe in their own homes and in their communities.We are not prepared to stand idly by as harmful practices such as conversion therapy happen in our country.                Gay rights activist Peter Tatchell arrested in Moscow                BBC left STUNNED as survey reveals 417 of its staff are transgenderThese activities are wrong, and we are not willing to let them continue. We will fully consider all legislative and non-legislative options to prohibit promoting, offering or conducting conversion therapy.Women and Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said: It is deeply worrying ... that so many LGBT people are being offered the abhorrent practice of conversion therapy.The Government is also promising to improve the police response to anti-gay hate crime, with 40 percent of those surveyed saying they had experienced at least one negative incident linked to their sexuality in the last year involving someone they did not live with.More than two thirds, 68 percent, of respondents said they had avoided holding hands in public with a same-sex partner for fear of a negative reaction from others and 70 percent said they had avoided being open about their sexuality, for the same reason.The Government is also promising to improve the police response to anti-gay hate crime.Nearly a quarter, 23 percent, said work colleagues had reacted negatively to them being LGBT.Mrs May commented: We can be proud that the UK is a world leader in advancing LGBT rights, but the overwhelming response to our survey has shone a light on the many areas where we can improve the lives of LGBT people.I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction.No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love.This LGBT action plan will set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society, from health and education to tackling discrimination and addressing the burning injustices that LGBT people face.Other proposals include appointing a national LGBT health adviser to improve access to health services, and programmes to tackle bullying in schools and colleges.Surrogacy laws will be revised to enable single people, including LGBT, to become legal parents of a child born to a surrogate.The Government is also today publishing its long-awaited consultation on how to reform the law on people changing their legal gender from the one they were assigned at birth, which currently requires a doctor\u0027s approval.Surrogacy laws will be revised to enable single people, including LGBT, to become legal parents.Previous calls to let people self identify sparked fears of men just claiming to be trans-gender to access female-only areas like women\u0027s toilets, changing rooms, and prisons.New Equalities Minister Ms Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary, is more cautious and has promised not to change the law on single-sex spaces.Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: The LGBT Action Plan is a welcome start but it falls short on key issues.These included the insultingly low allocation of \u0026pound4.5million failing to promise to end detention and deportation of LGBT refugees fleeing violently homophobic countries like Uganda, Iran, Russia, Egypt and Jamaica and the absence of a commitment to compensate gay and bisexual men whose lives were wrecked by convictions under past anti-gay laws."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/982869_1.jpg","title":"ronald reagan statue parliament square us embassy andrew rosindell","story":"EXPRESSThe Reagan statue was unveiled in 2011 in Grosvenor Square but has since been neglectedRomford Tory MP Andrew Rosindell has said that the treatment of the statue is an \u0026ldquoinsult to one of the great US Presidents who won the Cold War and was famous for his close working relationship with Margaret Thatcher.The Reagan statue was unveiled in 2011 in Grosvenor Square just outside the former US Embassy building to mark a centenary since his birth.The event at the time was attended by\u0026nbsp2,000 guests who listened to remarks by British Foreign Secretary William Hague, former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and the then US ambassador, Louis Susman.But since the embassy moved to its new home in Wandsworth, the statue has been neglected and pictures have emerged of it almost covered in plants which have overgrown around it.                \u0027It\u0027s a minefield\u0027 Trump \u0027would have been RIDICULED\u0027 at Royal Wedding                Donald Trump\u0026rsquos Iranian dissident support is akin to Reagan \u0026amp the PolesAhead of the current US President Donald Trump\u0026rsquos visit next week, Mr Rosindell has said that the statue needs to be restored and properly cared for.But he has gone further and called for it to be moved to Parliament Square to join other great world leaders such as Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela, Ghandi and Jan Smuts.Mr Rosindell said: \u0026ldquoPresident Reagan was a loyal friend of the United Kingdom and British people.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its terrible.Its only 15 yards from my living room and its not nice to sit down and look out on to.Its not fair, its really not fair on us. I feel like theyre trying to shut us up for now because were not important.The firm have apologised and said they will remove the canopy of the car wash and reduce the noise.Mrs Parker, whose husband died last year, has spoken to Rhondda Cynon Taf council who say they will be visiting her home in the next couple of days.Her daughter Mary Richards said: Its encroaching over my mothers garden and theres noise pollution which is going on as late as 10pm a night. My mother is so upset.They have got no consideration for their neighbours.When they started installing it I said they needed to stop, that it needs to come down, but they said they have to get on with their jobs.Its horrendous for my mother. Its her only bit of peace in her back garden, and the other neighbours feel the same. Its literally behind her fence, its absolutely awful.A spokesperson for Enterprise Holdings said: “We’d like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to our neighbours.“We had spoken to Mrs Parker’s family to find an amicable solution and had made alterations to the wash bay based on those conversations.“The canopy will now be removed and we will also put in place measures to reduce noise.“We remain willing to work with everyone to find a way forward.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417616818.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bouncer describes how have a go hero nearly lost legs diving into car as driver tried to mow down revellers","story":"Danni Harding rushed to help Andy Niinemae, 34, as he dived through a car window to tackle the out-of-control driver.He ended up pinned between two cars as he was rammed by the raging driver outside the Miss Jones bar in Cardiff.As he lay stricken on the road, Danni tried to stop the flow of blood before Andy was taken to hospital for surgery on his leg - with his family saying he is lucky to be alive.Describing the horror, bouncer Danni, 28, said: I have never seen anything like it in my whole 10 years of doors.Some guy tried to run over about 20 customers, and another guy jumped in his car window to stop him.He nearly took his legs off, he drove him straight into a taxi then halfway down the road threw him out of the car.I have seen some grim stuff in my time, but looking inside someones legs, at the bone and tissue was next level.Andy has since been hailed a hero after rushing to help when the driver deliberately drove at the revellers on Saturday night.The motorist then smashed into a parked taxi before speeding off leaving a trail of debris.  Andys mum Joanne Niinemae said: My son jumped through a closed car window to stop a drunk driver who was aiming to mow people down who were outside a pub.The driver then slammed his car into another trapping his legs, with such force the bumper of car came off.His injuries were horrific with huge lacerations on leg and arm, resulting in emergency surgery.The security lady at Miss Jones pub saved his life as he saved many lives himself. To her we will be eternally grateful.Long recovery process ahead. Hes lucky to be alive.Police confirmed they are investigating the crash and are appealing for CCTV of the incident.Detective Inspector Paul Raikes said: “This was a shocking incident that has left one man with a very nasty leg injury and understandably overwhelmed by what has happened.“A full investigation is underway to identify and arrest those responsible.“We would appeal for anyone with information to come forward and would also like to hear from anyone who may have CCTV , dashcam or mobile phone footage of the incident.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417542533.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum claims her fiance 49 is mistaken for her dad in the street but pair dont mind 26 year age gap","story":"Robyn Norman, 23, claims that she and fiancé Andy Bronson, 49, both from Harwich, Essex, often receive dirty looks from strangers in the street because of their age difference.Robyn however says that she doesn’t care what people think because Andy is the love of her life.She said: “Me and Andy are perfect for each other and no one’s opinion of our relationship could ever change that.“I know that negativity surrounding our relationship just comes from ignorance. We don’t let anything people say affect us, we’re a strong couple.”Robyn met Andy in December 2015 through the social media site Instagram.Robyn said: “As soon as I saw his picture, I fancied him.“I thought he was gorgeous. I loved his grey hair and big smile. So I sent him a message straight away. We started chatting every day and we got on like a house on fire.“We’d flirt all day long and whenever he messaged me, I’d get a big smile on my face.“I added him on Snapchat and could tell that he was young at heart when he started sending me funny pictures.“Even when I discovered he was 26 years older than me, I couldn’t help fancying him.”And after a week of chatting , Andy, a train driver, invited Robyn over to his house for a roast dinner.She said: “We hit it off right away. I loved how he cooked me dinner – it felt so mature. We chatted so easily and I felt as though I’d known him my whole life.“He invited me over again the next day and from then on, I never left. Thing moved quickly but it felt right. We both just clicked and knew we wanted to be with each other for the rest of our lives.”Robyn says that the couple’s large age gap didn’t bother her.She said: “Andy acts younger than he is so I never felt like I was with a much older man.“He’s always up for a laugh and was racing around. Andy told me he had a daughter who was four years older than me.“I was worried that she might not like his dad dating someone younger than her.“But she was happy for us and we get along great.”One month after the couple started dating, Robyn discovered that she was pregnant.She said: “I was scared to tell Andy as we’d only been together for a short time. But he was over the moon. And I couldn’t wait to start a family with him.”But the couple received a negative reaction from others.Robyn says: “Walking around town with Andy when I was pregnant was awful. Everyone would just stare at us and we’d get horrible looks.“We just laughed it off. One day in a shop, the assistant called Andy my dad. I felt myself go bright red but Andy just kissed me on the cheek and told me not to worry about it.”In July 2016, eighteen months after they started dating, Andy proposed to Robyn during a trip to London.She says: “When I saw him get down on one knee I was over the moon. I said ‘yes’ straight away.“Andy is perfect and I can’t wait for us to spend the rest of our lives together.”Robyn and Andy welcomed their daughter, Madison, now one, to the world in September 2016.She says: “Andy had pure love in his eyes when he saw Madison for the first time. From that moment, I didn’t care about any funny looks we got. We are a perfect little family.“All that matters is that we’re happy and we can prove all our doubters wrong. We still get dirty looks, but I just give Andy a big kiss to show them how we don’t care.“We’re busy planning a big wedding for next year.“Andy is 26 years older than me, but he’s my perfect man.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000356955835.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"daily aspirin could help to stop alzheimers in its tracks scientists believe","story":"Tests on mice showed the over-the-counter medicine destroyed rogue proteins which build up in the brain.These clump together into plaques which stop brain cells communicating with each other — leading to the memory loss and confusion typical of the disease.Aspirin is already used by millions to reduce inflammation in the body, the process which triggers most major life-threatening illnesses.The US team has found the painkiller also boosts a chemical which cleans up cells of plaques, including those made of the amyloid beta proteins  in the brain which are linked to Alzheimer’s.They are hopeful the mice results will also be found in humans, and that an aspirin pill a day could prove a new way of fighting the dementia.Prof Kalipada Pahan of Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, said: “At present, there is no effective treatment for preventing or halting the disease.“Oral administration of a low dose of aspirin decreased amyloid plaques in male and female mice.” About 850,000 Britons live with Alzheimer’s and dementia.Prof Kalipada Pahan of Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, said: “At present, there is no effective treatment for preventing or halting the disease.“Oral administration of a low dose of aspirin decreased amyloid plaques in male and female mice.”About 850,000 Britons live with Alzheimer’s and dementiaOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The victim was left uninjured but shaken by the ordeal."},{"url":null,"title":"brazen couple caught romping in barber shop in full view of street as stunned passerby films them in the act","story":"The brazen pair were filmed in VIP Barbers in Greenock, Scotland, by a stunned onlooker at 4.40am on Sunday while he walked home from his job in a nightclub.The shutters were up on the shop and the lights were blazing to allow passers-by to see the sleazy show.The man who filmed the romp can be heard saying No danger - VIP barbers, twenty to five in the morning.  What the f***!He told The Sun Online: I was on my way to a pals house after work when I saw it.It was the last thing I expected to see at that time of the morning.The wild footage has been viewed more than 46,000 times since it was posted on social media.But others found the 36-second footage hilarious, branding it “typical Greenock”.One said: “Naw be sitting on that seat again!!”Another replied: “Typical Greenock man hahaha x”.Ive no idea who they are but they must have had access to the barbers because the lights were on and music was playing.You expect folk shouting and bawling at that time but not folk romping in a shop.VIP Barbers declined to comment.We recently told you how another shameless pair were at it in a cemetery up against a GRAVESTONE.And a Scots dad went ballistic when a randy couple appeared to be having sex beside his teenage daughter in an airport lobby."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000416943470-e1530567648312.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"piers morgans ego ally ross tv","story":"Not despite that barnacle-brained oaf Piers Morgan, as some of you might think, but largely because of him and his complete inability to keep a lid on a dementedly competitive streak which, one minute, had him ­threatening to “gorge on the innards” of BBC rival Dan Walker, the next, saw him getting soundly thrashed by Richard Arnold in an egg and spoon race.Wiser heads, of course, would have settled for painting themselves into just one corner. Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without a Parliamentary majority and with a Cabinet that has ­forgotten Lord Melbourne’s definition of collective responsibility “it is not much matter which we say, but mind, we must all say the same”, nonetheless she carries on.Perhaps the vicar’s daughter is inspired by the hymn “Jesus good above all other, gentle child of gentle mother, in a stable born our brother, give us grace to persevere”.It is certainly a grace she has been given in abundance and it is also her great strength.As the Cabinet prepares to assemble in the Buckinghamshire countryside it may choose to reflect on what we have already done and it should consider what unity and determination can deliver.The European Communities Act will be repealed next March. The country is now leaving the EU in its own domestic law, just as the UK was already leaving the EU in international law under the relevant treaties.The United Kingdom has irrevocably set a new course. One where the nation will be free to make its own laws and conclude its own trade agreements, free to take back control of its immigration policy and no longer obliged to pay “Eurogeld” in return for the dubious privilege of following EU laws.The question for the Cabinet at Chequers is what to do with the freedom the British people want reinstated.Does it seize this great opportunity to do things better, to forge new trade relationships, to have better laws, regulations and policies, or does it follow the managers of decline to place a once proud country in a tremulous state that sees Brexit as mere damage limitation?This is a historic decision and one the Prime Minister is well placed to make. Theresa May has the vision and has put the law in place to leave the EU. However, there are political challenges ahead.There is a need to overcome a fear of the future. In leaving the EU, the UK will have a new relationship with it based on trade without political convergence. Trade between two friends and partners who respect each other’s internal legal authority.This is the case for the majority of world trade. Yet there are still those who advocate the vassal state, with the UK accepting the domestic application of EU laws as a price of trade — something no other trading partner agrees to.Then we need to call the Irish bluff. There is no insurmountable problem concerning the Northern Ireland border and any solution which would split the UK in two is outrageous. That the EU suggested it is offensive.This fake alarum should be seen for what it is: Domestic Irish politicking in advance of a general election, with Dublin being gullibly exploited by Brussels.The Irish government, if not the European Commission, thought that Dublin had “cast-iron guarantees” which suited them last December, then again last March, and they had hopes of finally getting them in June.They have been disappointed each time by their friends on the continent. Ireland is being used by the EU to put pressure on us. The Taoiseach’s announcement that he is supporting Belgium over England might get cheered in Irish pubs but it is not getting them anywhere in Brussels.What ought the Cabinet to decide on Friday? Above all it must maintain the clear negotiating line set out at the beginning: No deal is better than a bad deal, and plenty of bad deals are on offer.Fortunately, David Davis, with his titanium-plated spine and his ministers in the Department for Exiting the European Union, have ensured that preparations for a “no-deal” scenario are well advanced.There can be no sensible argument that we have to take a bad deal because a “no-deal” outcome has not been prepared for. This is simply incorrect, primarily thanks to the Brexit minister Steve Baker.The Cabinet should agree that if there is to be a deal, it has to be agreed in detail prior to our departure.There is no legal reason to pay £39billion to the EU on our departure and if there were no guarantee of a trade agreement, it is something I would strongly oppose in any vote in the House of Commons.Likewise leaving the EU into the purgatory of a perpetual transition would be foolish.If a bad trade agreement should be rejected, what exactly is a respectable one?It must be judged against the UK’s economic interests but there are some things that no independent nation could agree to.Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected. Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy, makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted. Indeed many MPs would vote against such propositions if brought to Parliament.In this regard Michael Gove was right to tear up any form of the idiotic customs partnership. The Prime Minister commands the support of Brexit-backing MPs, Conservative Party members and Brexiteers in the nation at large.This is why her opinion poll ratings remain so high. Yet the metropolitan establishment of fashionable society and the beau monde is still against her. Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised.One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, did decide to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way so leaving him dependent on opposition votes.This left the Tories out of majority office for 28 years, 1846 to 1874. At least he did so for a policy that worked.At Chequers the Prime Minister must stick to her righteous cause and deliver what she has said she would. She must use her undoubted grace to persevere.It is incredible to watch Europhile Tories savage Jacob Rees-Mogg simply for insisting, as he does on this page, that Theresa May should keep the promises she has repeatedly made.Of course she must. The future of her Government and our democracy hinge on it. Yet her top aide Oliver Robbins reportedly intends on Friday to demand that the Cabinet signs off what amounts to a betrayal of the referendum vote.His strategy, to stay in the EU’s single market for goods, already looks fatal to regaining full control of immigration, freeing ourselves from the sway of the European Court of Justice and striking our own trade deals.And that’s before Brussels formally rejects it, as it will. Michel Barnier will then demand full single market membership, with free movement, and kill our ambition to trade independently too.What will Mrs May do then?The Sun has always believed her pledges to take back control of our ­borders, laws and money. We still agree that “no deal” is better than a bad one. But the EU is now clear that a bad deal is our only option — and Barnier admits he’s not even negotiating.Will the PM ever say enough is enough and honour her “red lines”? Or will she cross more of them? How is Robbins’ plan Brexit? It’s not.Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox must not stand for it. Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb.

I was struck by just how many respondents said they cannot be open about their sexual orientation or avoid holding hands with their partner in public for fear of a negative reaction.“No one should ever have to hide who they are or who they love “This LGBT action plan will set out concrete steps to deliver real and lasting change across society, from health and education to tackling discrimination and addressing the burning injustices that LGBT people face.”LGBT hate crime had been experienced by 40 per cent of those surveyed, with more than nine in 10 of the most serious offences going unreported.The plan aims to look into the scale of LGBT abuse online, improving mental healthcare, combating bullying in schools, and increasing awareness of the services for victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse.Laura Russell, of the LGBT campaign group Stonewall, said it was “heartbreaking” so many people had been offered conversion therapies.She added: “Our 2015 Unhealthy Attitudes report revealed that one in 10 health and social care staff across Britain witnessed colleagues express the dangerous belief that someone can be ‘cured’ of being lesbian, gay or bi.”Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell backed the move on conversion therapy.

I had a really good holiday but at the end I just wanted to get home.Nobody should have been in that situation.Im still in a lot of pain today and will be going to the doctors later.I would never use Thomas Cook again.One passenger told Sun Online they saw many people having panic attacks while others reportedly stripped to deal with the unbearable heat.Pregnant women and babies were apparently left to their own devices, while passengers claim two people were rushed to hospital.Desperate holidaymakers say they broke into chanting in a bid to leave the overheated aircraft, with temperatures said to reach up to 48C in the back of the plane.The 214 people on flight MH1805 were expecting to fly to Stansted airport at 2pm, and were initially told the delay was down to the plane needing to be refuelled.They say they were repeatedly told they were taking off in a few minutes, and forbidden from leaving the grounded plane.Lee Palombo was on the plane with his wife Flordelise, a nurse who rushed to assist a pregnant woman who was struggling to breathe.The 43-year-old from Papworth, Cambridgeshire, said passengers begged for water but were denied it.“I can’t fathom why they didn’t give us any drinks, he said. Someone could have died on that plane.“I’m very concerned that they would keep people on the plane in that boiling heat, I’m healthy so I was okay but people were getting really ill.Diabetic passenger Isabella Wright said she nearly passed out from the heat and lack of food and described their treatment as horrific and a breach of human rights.The nightmare continued off the plane, as exhausted passengers were finally sent to hotels after the flight was eventually cancelled.A pregnant lady was said to have been taken to different accommodation and told to stump up cash, and ended up spending the night in workers accommodation without air con or a shower.Isabella Wright added that her hotel room was dirty and unhygienic and had no clean spaces for her to carry out injections vital for her diabetes.A Thomas Cook Airlines spokesperson said they would be looking into the individual claims, and confirmed passengers had departed Zante at 9am local time this morning - 19 hours after the scheduled departure.They added that passengers were taken to a number of different hotels where they could get rooms, and all passengers were given welfare and dinner in addition to a hotel.We tried to fix the issue so that we could get customers on their way as soon as possible, but we recognise that we should have disembarked the aircraft earlier."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000304336002.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain poorest need major income raise","story":"Alarming research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found transport, childcare and energy costs are up to two thirds more expensive than a decade ago - but earnings have barely risen in real terms.It found families on low incomes were facing bigger barriers to meet rising costs than a decade ago - despite tightening their belts and shopping around online for better deals.The JRF’s Minimum Income Standard (MIS) calculator found a single adult needs to earn £18,400 to buy the basic costs of living, each parent in a working couple with two children needs to earn £20,000 and a lone parent with a pre-school child must earn £28,450.The MIS is a model created by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University as a barometer of living standards in the UK.Since 2008, the cost of a minimum basket of goods and services has risen by 35 per cent for a single adult and by 30 per cent for a couple with two children compared to a 25 per cent increase in the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation.The outlook is bleakest for pensioners - who have faced a 50 per cent rise in the cost of their basic living costs since 2008.JRF called on the Government to allow families to keep more of their earnings by increasing the Work Allowance under Universal Credit.This would help three million working families on low incomes reach a decent standard of living, said JRF.The report said public transport has become much more expensive and bus services have been cut so that transport costs take up nearly a fifth of minimum household budgets.Bus travel is 65% more expensive in 2018 than in 2008 so for a single person the minimum transport budget has risen from £17 to £37 a week, said the report.The average cost of food rose by just over a quarter between 2008 and 2018, but a minimum food budget for a single person rose from £29 to £44 a week, a rise of just over 50%, while energy bills are over 40% higher than a decade ago.Childcare costs have risen sharply, with the average price of a full-time nursery place for a two-year-old rising by more than 50% in the past decade to £229 a week.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “These figures show just how precarious life can be for low-income households.“People who live below the minimum standard say that they shop around to get the best deals and juggle to pay the bills, but the soaring cost of transport, energy and childcare means millions of families are still locked in a daily struggle to make ends meet.“Some working parents are actually further away from reaching a decent living standard because tax credits to top up low wages have been falling at a time when families need them most.“The Government must put things right by allowing families to keep more of their earnings. This would ease the constraints the crippling cost of living places on their ability to build a better life and ensure everyone can reach a decent standard of living.”A Government spokesman said: “We recognise some families face real challenges with livings costs and that is why we are helping them earn more and keep more of what they earn.“Our increases to the national living wage have put £2,000 more into people’s pockets, we are backing families by providing 30 hours free childcare and have cut income tax for 31 million people.”Labour’s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “By cutting social security while the cost of essentials is rising steeply, the Tories are making a conscious choice to push low income families into poverty.“For all Theresa May’s talk of helping the ‘just about managing’, her Government has made life more difficult for people across the country.“Labour would halt the roll-out Universal Credit, which is clearly causing great hardship, and introduce a £10 Real Living Wage to ensure that work pays.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The future of her Government and our democracy hinge on it. Yet her top aide Oliver Robbins reportedly intends on Friday to demand that the Cabinet signs off what amounts to a betrayal of the referendum vote.His strategy, to stay in the EU’s single market for goods, already looks fatal to regaining full control of immigration, freeing ourselves from the sway of the European Court of Justice and striking our own trade deals.And that’s before Brussels formally rejects it, as it will. Michel Barnier will then demand full single market membership, with free movement, and kill our ambition to trade independently too.What will Mrs May do then?The Sun has always believed her pledges to take back control of our ­borders, laws and money. We still agree that “no deal” is better than a bad one. But the EU is now clear that a bad deal is our only option — and Barnier admits he’s not even negotiating.Will the PM ever say enough is enough and honour her “red lines”? Or will she cross more of them? How is Robbins’ plan Brexit? It’s not.Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, David Davis and Liam Fox must not stand for it. Nor must sensible Cabinet Remainers.Voters are not dumb. They will smell a sellout instantly.It would be a national calamity — suicidal for the PM, her Government and party.“It’s not negotiation - it’s a capitulation.”Senior Eurosceptic Tories confronted the PM in the Commons yesterday to angrily demand the PM scotch other rumours that she wants the UK to join the European Economic Area alongside Norway – the ultimate soft Brexit.Sir Bill Cash branded EEA membership for Britain as “preposterous” and that it would “undermine democracy if that were true”.Mrs May replied: “The EEA would not deliver on the vote of the British people.”Sir Desmond Swayne asked Mrs May if Brexit could still be “recognised as Brexit”.To laughter from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted her own catchphrase to insist: “There has been much jocularity around the term ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but it does mean Brexit”.Arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, exploded rivalries by warning Mrs may she would split the Tories in two as Sir Robert Peel did in 1846 if she gave up her Brexit red lines to strike a deal with Brussels.The Somerset MP also called for Theresa May to stand firm for what she herself has promised.He was savaged by a series of Tory moderates, including foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan.Accusing Rees-Mogg of “insolence”, Sir Alan accused him of “lecturing and threatening the PM”, adding: “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise \u0026amp should pipe down”.Grandee Sir Nicholas Soames: told him to “shut up” and “put a sock in it.But Sir Alan’s own boss in the Foreign Office, Boris Johnson, leaped in to defend Mr Rees-Mogg.Some pro-EU politicians want Britain to stay in the customs unionafter Brexit - but that has been ruled out by Theresa May, because it would stop us striking any new trade deals with the rest of the world.Last year, the PM set out two possible paths for the future customs relationship between Britain and Europe.One option is the customs partnership - which would mirror many aspects of the existing customs union.It would see the UK collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods which enter Britain on their way to the continent.The advantage of that would be no border checks would be needed between the UK and EU, particularly on the key Irish border, but Brexiteers worry it would tie us too closely to Europe.The alternative is known as maximum facilitation - a hi-tech arrangement where automated systems check goods as they flow across borders in a way which helps business trade freely.But EU bosses have cast doubt on whether the right technology exists to make that solution work.While the row may seem technical, many Brexit backers regard it as crucial for the UK to take total control of our trade and customs arrangements, or risk making our EU departure pointless.Theresa May faces a major challenge finding a solution which is acceptable for both hardline Eurosceptics and the pro-EU Tory rebels.The Foreign Secretary tweeted: “ It’s vital that all MPs are able to air their views on Brexit.“Whatever your position, I hope we can all agree that Jacob Rees-Mogg is a principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country.”Mrs May was due to address rich Tory donors at the party’s annual summer fundraiser at the posh Hurlingham Club in West London.She will also travel to the Netherlands today to explain her latest thinking to Dutch PM Mark Rutte, and Berlin on Thursday to see German boss Angela Merkel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How do we leave the customs union and single market without damaging business and creating a hard border in Northern Ireland?The first two ways have met road blocks.The \"customs partnership\" was an arrangement that would see UK officials collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for any other EU member state.It was complicated, untried and, some argued, unworkable.\"Max Fac\", favoured by Brexiteers, would employ new technologies and \"trusted trader\" schemes to remove the need for cumbersome customs checks. Detractors say this would be very expensive and take time to set up. So you would expect the \"third way\" must be some form of compromise.It could, for example, take aspects of Max Fac, but offer alignment with the EU\u0027s custom\u0027s union over goods, while having a looser arrangement over services.This idea would alleviate some of the concerns expressed by BMW and Airbus, but purist Brexiteers fear it would make international trade deals harder if not impossible.Plus, the EU would probably shelve it in the bin-shaped file marked \"cherry picking\".During her statement to the House of Commons on the European Council meeting the PM seemed to rule this idea out anyway.She said that she would \"ensure we can get trade around the rest of the world\". This requires a full extraction from the customs union.She confirmed that leaving the customs union and the single market remained her intention.During questions after the PM\u0027s statement, the Brexit camp tried to eek-out clues as her thinking on this mystical \"third way\".So no to EEA no to the customs union and no to the single market. All the red lines look firmly in place.You would think that the Brexiteers have wind of a compromise. Why else would Jacob Rees-Mogg warn his Prime Minister in an article in the Daily  that his prime minister risked collapsing her government.Why would Boris Johnson lend his backing to Mr Rees-Mogg as a \"principled and dedicated MP who wants the best for our country\"?My advice is don\u0027t read too much into it.Mogg\u0027s article is the kind that seems to get written at even the slightest twitch from the PM and without any tangible cause. It was a posturing pre-threat.The PM said in the Commons today: \"We will be setting out, in greater detail than we have done so far, our proposals for that trade agreement with the European Union, making very clear to it the options that now lie on the table.\"That makes me think that Mrs May still believes the \"third way\" answer is wrapped up in the future trade agreement giving the EU \"options\" which the PM will argue are mutually beneficial. When asked directly about Airbus and BMW wanting the UK to remain in the customs union, the PM said: \"We will of course be putting in place customs arrangements with the European Union that will match the ambition of our trading relationship in the future.\"My bet is that the \"third way\" is packaged as such.In other words, rather than asking for a Norway relationship with opt-outs (which the EU won\u0027t allow) she will go for a Canada-style trade relationship with bespoke opt-ins such as an EU financial services passport (which the EU may well also reject).But if, like Mr Dyer you are still looking for greater clarity on this, I refer you to the PM\u0027s own words.She told the Commons: \"There has been much jocularity around the term \u0027Brexit means Brexit\u0027, but it does mean Brexit.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-jean-claude-juncker_4323522.jpg?20180529130434 ","title":"theresa may asks treasury for brexit analysis","story":"Mrs Morgan said: \"Parliament\u0027s vote on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship can only be meaningful if it is properly informed.\"The Chancellor has promised the committee that he will place the \u0027maximum amount of analysis in the public domain\u0027 on the economic and fiscal consequences of implementing the withdrawal agreement and future relationship, once it has been negotiated.\"I have written to him to set out the committee\u0027s expectations for what that analysis should contain."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-papers-tuesday_4351737.jpg?20180702220329 ","title":"uk weather forecast shows hot temperatures throughout july","story":"The warm period may, however, struggle to beat the drought of 1976 where there was a record 45 days without rain, Sky weather presenter Isobel Lang said.With higher-than-average temperatures there is concern over water levels in rivers and reservoirs.Hosepipe bans have already been in place in some areas during June and these are likely to spread to other parts of the UK.

Local authorities may no longer be able to afford core services such as running libraries, fixing potholes or even collecting rubbish by 2025 because of the cash crisis. It will leave services like the pick-up of household waste from millions of doorsteps “damaged beyond recognition”, experts say. The Local Government Association says Chancellor Philip Hammond’s next spending review will be “make or break” for councils. In the decade to 2020, councils will have suffered cuts in core funding from the Government of \u0026pound16billion. And authorities face an alarming funding gap of \u0026pound7.8billion by 2025, according to a report. The LGA issued the warning at the start of its annual conference, in Birmingham.  Cash-strapped councils are now dipping into their reserves and many are in danger of running out of cash.

LGA chairman Lord Porter said: “We’ve reached a point where councils will no longer be able to support our residents as they expect, including our most vulnerable – let alone help the country to prosper. “More and more councils are struggling to balance their books and others are considering whether they have the funding to even deliver statutory requirements.

On average children are having the equivalent of three sugar lumps at breakfast. For poorer children that is often much worse. That is obviously contributing a lot to the childhood obesity epidemic, he said. The Government\u0027s childhood obesity plan published last month set out a range of measures - including a ban on supermarket check-out promotions involving sweets and fatty snacks - intended to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030.  But Mr Stevens told the committee they also needed to look at the ingredients that went into products such a breakfast cereals. Calorie labelling, traffic-lighting, changed promotional approaches in the retail sector - they have all got to play their part, he said. But I think we are going to need to see much greater action on food reformulation over the next several years in the way that we have begun to see on sugar, sweet and beverages.

There’s lots to celebrate because we can be proud the UK is a world leader in LGBT rights. But I know that, in 2018, many LGBT people still have to deal with discrimination, hatred and even violence and I’m determined to do something about it. Last year we launched the first national LGBT survey which attracted more than 108,000 responses, making it the largest survey of its kind anywhere in the world. Some of the findings make for difficult reading. I was shocked to learn that two-thirds of people avoid holding hands in public with same-sex partners for fear of a negative reaction.  That so many people fear the consequences of this simple gesture shows that a society in which we are all treated equally and fairly is still some way off. Two in five of the people surveyed had experienced verbal harassment or physical violence simply because of their sexuality. Worse still, 90% of those people felt they couldn’t report it because “it happens all the time”. It’s for reasons such as these that we’re publishing our LGBT Action Plan, setting out the concrete steps to help improve lives for LGBT people and eliminate the discrimination and inequality they face. We are going to appoint a national adviser on health inequalities, so the specific needs of LGBT people are at the heart of the NHS. We will continue our investment in programmes to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying in schools, protecting LGBT students and confronting hatred in all its forms.

Only today, Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan accused revolting Brextremist Jacob Rees-Mogg of “insolence” for threatening to topple Theresa May.  Business Minister Richard Harrington piling in with a dogma-first dig at Rees-Smug with backencher Richard Benyon appealing for silence from Brexit ultras is a complete public breakdown of party discipline. Hostile briefings rubbishing Theresa May last summer were blamed on “too much sun and too much warm Prosecco” by David Lidington, a Cabinet Minister with a dry wit.

This July the unruly Conservative MPs are drunk on Brexit, regarding it a poisonous cocktail best avoided or an intoxicating drink to be gulped not sipped.

It would be quicker to list who in her Cabinet doesn’t fancy their chances of succeeding the Prime Minister. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s regiment leaks more letters than any Russian mole could ever dream of copying. Home Secretary Sajid Javid plots to follow his predecessor but one into No 10 by disowning her past. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s loyalty is scheming disloyalty in these unusual times from the Florence Nightingale candidate.  Environment Secretary Michael Gove’s apparent interest in what backbenchers think gives his game away. Philip Hammond, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Amber Rudd, Priti Patel and -cited as evidence his colleagues have lost their heads by an MP yearning for unity - Chris “Failing” Grayling don’t just go to bed dreaming of the top job but wake up plotting how to seize it.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

The world\u0027s most popular beverage really does help people live longer - no matter how much they put away, according to new research. And it\u0027s not the caffeine that has the effect as the results were the same for those who drink decaff. In one of the biggest studies of its kind mortality rates of almost half a million middle aged and elderly Britons were compared with their coffee intake. Those who glugged six or seven cups a day fared best. They were 16 percent less likely to die from any disease over a ten year period than those who never touched the black stuff.  And the biggest coffee addicts did nearly as well. Those who got through eight cups a day - or more - saw death rates cut by 14 percent. This is twice the maximum amount of caffeine recommended by the UK Food Standards Agency. The protective effect was also identified among moderate and light coffee drinkers - but to a lesser degree. Two to five cups, one cup or less than one cup a day reduced mortality by 12, eight and six per cent, respectively, during the decade long analysis. Lead author Dr Erikka Loftfield, a cancer epidemiologist, said the results applied to all types of coffee including ground, instant and decaffeinated. The study published in JAMA Internal Medicine adds to mounting evidence coffee should be part of a healthy diet, she said.  No association was identified between any amount of coffee consumed and long-term health risks including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer. Dr Loftfield said the findings suggest the importance of its non-caffeine constituents. She said: In this large study of nearly 500,000 people in the United Kingdom, coffee drinking was inversely associated with all-cause mortality, with statistically significant inverse associations observed in participants drinking 1 to 8 or more cups per day. Coffee has long been linked with combating heart disease, cancer, dementia , diabetes and depression. It is abundant in antioxidants which reduce inflammation and boost lung function and sensitivity to the glucose-controlling hormone insulin. People are normally advised to drink no more than four cups of coffee a day - about 400mg. Too much caffeine can trigger insomnia, a fast heartbeat and even muscle tremors.   New cashpoint rule comes into force - and this is how it will affect you  The latest study was based on data from the UK BioBank, one of the world\u0027s most ambitious projects that tracks the health and lifestyles of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. It found coffee was just as big a benefit to the estimated ten percent of the population who carry a gene mutation that slows up caffeine digestion. This makes the stimulant stay in the body longer - raising fears coffee could spark a stroke or heart attack by causing high blood pressure. But the genetic data in the UK BioBank allowed Dr Loftfield to rule this theory out. She said: We found very similar associations between coffee drinking and mortality across levels of examined caffeine metabolism scores. She added: There has been concern about the health effects of heavy coffee drinking, particularly in participants with common genetic mutations that affect caffeine metabolism. Previous studies in the US, Europe and Asia have found a consistent link between coffee drinking and reduced deaths from all causes including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson\u0027s disease and liver, bowel and womb cancer.

The mum-of-four returned home from the school run last Friday when she saw the flames over taking her back garden on Harris Avenue in Rumney, Cardiff.  Wales Online reports that the blaze destroyed a trampoline, bikes and a paddling pool which belonged to her children, all aged under 12.   Danielle said firefighters told her it was fortunate the wind blew the flames away from the house or the damage could have been far worse. It started at about 3.15pm but it burned for about two hours, Danielle said. My kids were watching it through the window before they were evacuated from the house. If the wind didn\u0027t change when it did, the fire brigade said it could have been much worse. The family live with their gardens backing on to a large open field in Rumney.  She said the fire may have started on a large pile of grass that was left at the back of their hedge. My kids play out there, she said. It happened when we were getting the kids from school.

The heat is forecast to remain through the second half of July and August, computer models show. Britain is hotter than 29C Barbados.

Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said: “This week could see 33C in the second half of the week, and next week looks much like last week and could come close to 35C. “Lots of very warm, dry, sunny and settled weather is ahead, and humid nights mean it will be difficult to sleep.” The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Parallels with the famous 1976 summer can be made.  “There’s no sign of an end to the heat. Warmth looks like continuing for the first half of July.

Philanthropic petrolheads battled it out to get their hands on the stunning 204mph McLaren 570S Spider at The Argento Ball. The convertible, which McLaren Automotive donated to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, would have typically cost around \u0026pound165,000. But at the star-studded bash, attended by the likes of Ed Sheeran, Victoria Beckham and Tracey Emin, it ended up being bought by an anonymous bidder for \u0026pound725,000. All of the proceeds from the sale at Sir Elton John’s home in Berkshire will go towards helping create an AIDS-free future.  Sir Elton said We are thrilled with the success of the event. Funds raised can make a real impact for our work with young people.” In addition to picking up the 570S Spider, the auction winner will receive a personal tour of the McLaren Technology Centre by Amanda McLaren, the only child of founder Bruce McLaren and a brand ambassador for McLaren Automotive. Their new car is fitted with a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine which develops 562bhp.  This gives the McLaren 570S Spider a 0-62mph time of 3.2 seconds and a 0-124mph time of 9.6 seconds. It has a top speed of 204mph, making it one of the world’s quickest convertibles. The roof is an electrically-folding hardtop that can be lowered in just 15 seconds at speeds of up to 25mph. To mark the sale and celebrate the Argento Ball’s silver anniversary, the special 570S Spider was hand-sprayed in special metallic ‘Blade Silver’.  The McLaren has incredible stopping power thanks to its carbon ceramic brakes. At 124mph, the high-powered brakes will bring the McLaren to a standstill in just 133 metres. At 62mph, the McLaren will be stationary in just 32 metres. Inside, the bespoke 570S Spider features a ‘By McLaren’ Sport interior with Jet Black Nappa leather seats stitched with Carbon Black thread.

People on board included pregnant women and mothers with young children who began to \u0027melt\u0027 as the air conditioning unit failed and temperatures soared to as high as 40C, it was claimed. One person even suffered a panic attack, a witness said. Flight MH1805 was expected to depart from Zante, Greece, for London Stansted airport at 2pm on Sunday. Travellers say they were originally told the plane needed to be refueled resulting in an initial one hour delay to the flight. They were then trapped inside for three hours without adequate water supplies resulting in many passing out and throwing up.  Kerry Shippey said: “Nobody minds a delay, things happen, but keeping people in a tin can in 40 degree heat so that people are passing out and throwing up is taking things a little far don’t you think?” Dan Chapman, 22, told the Mirror: “It was very dangerous as there were some very old and pregnant women, as well as babies on board. “Two people passed out and an ambulance had to be sent out for them. “It is illegal to treat animals like this let alone people. “People were very agitated after we were refused from exiting the plane for reasons I am unsure about. I\u0027ve also lost a days work today, as have many others. “It was easily the most uncomfortable experience of my life.”  An 18-year-old travelling abroad for the first time with a group of friends, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “There were only six bottles of water given out to the whole plane, which were supposedly meant for the cabin crew and passengers. Once this had run out cabin crew melted down ice for extra supplies. “I saw one young woman around the age of 17 suffered a panic attack and needed oxygen and was taken away in an ambulance. “I was travelling with a group of nine 18-year-old girls and it was our first time travelling on our own for all of us. It was fairly traumatic and stressful for all involved.  Videos posted online showed restless passengers dripped with sweat and fanning themselves with safety instruction cards. The nightmare continued off the plane, as exhausted passengers were finally sent to hotels after the flight was eventually cancelled. Another holidaymaker told us how she “arrived at our accommodation to find cockroaches on the walls.” She added: “We were told a transfer would pick us up from the hotel at 6am but this didn’t arrive. “We later found out that us and another hotel down the road had been forgotten about.

The team of ghost hunters, Bear and Wolf, travelled to Coombe Abbey near Coventry so they could look into its ghoulish past.  Coombe Abbey was a Cistercian monastery built in the 1100s and is now a hotel, reports Coventry Live .  Most of the supposed spooky happenings at the abbey are blamed on the \u0027ghost\u0027 of Abbott Geoffrey, a monk who was murdered in 1345. Guests have reported seeing a cowled figure \u0027float around the hotels\u0027 grounds. A Romany girl, called Matilda, is also said to haunt the hotel - dressed in rags and found near the stables.  She is claimed to have been abused by men from the Craven family who owned the abbey in the 19th century, and so-called The Shadow Warriors wanted to find out more of her tragic tale. Before dying in childbirth, Matilda cursed the family who were said to have then suffered terrible luck. Other spirits reported at the hotel include a ghostly horseman and a Victorian woman who stands at the roadside. Bear said: “When we first arrived we connected with the spirit of a young girl, Matilda, she was a stable-hand when Coombe Abbey was still a manor house. “We picked up her presence, then we read the history afterwards when we had seen the footage, and the history didn’t match to what our medium gave us which was that Matilda was actually sexually abused by the Cravens, in the secret room. We had full access to the manor house then and there is a secret room on the fourth floor. “We picked up that she was pregnant, but Craven didn’t want anything to do with the child or any rumours going around, to harm his reputation. So the baby was born but it was taken from her by caesarean section, and it was done privately in the house and the child was eventually lost.

It was revealed earlier the children and their coach had been found alive after nine days underground following a rescue mission involving nearly 900 soldiers and emergency service personnel. The youngsters, aged 11 to 16,from the Wild Boars football team, can be seen with beaming smiles in the snaps - believed to be from a previous caving trip - which were shared by an overjoyed relative. Rescue workers at the site were also pictured cheering after hearing the good news while relatives even held a mass prayer session. The rescue mission began when the boys\u0027 bikes and football boots were found at the mouth of the Tham Luang caves, in the northern province of Chiang Rai.  The boys team were trapped by rising waters inside the cave network deep inside a mountain. They are: Chanin Wiboonroongrueng, 11, Duangphet Promthep, age unknown, Phornchid Kamluang, 16, Prachuck Sutham, 14, Somphong Jaiwong, 13, Peerapat Sompiengjai, 16, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Panumart Saengdee, age unknown, Pipat Phothai, 15, Nattawoot Thakamsai, 14, Adul Samon, 14, Mongkol Boonpium, 13, and coack Ekkapol Chantawong, 25. Nearly 900 soldiers and rescue workers, including members of an elite military diving unit, were drafted in to search the cave system. All 12 boys and their coach were today found alive, according to the regional governor, and an operation to bring them to the surface has begun.  Thai Navy seals have found all 13 with signs of life, Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters. For around half a mile, the cave is wide open with spectacular limestone rock formations. But deeper in, the the network narrows and signs warn visitors not to venture further during the rainy season, which usually begins in July, because it is prone to flooding.  A national park ranger alerted authorities when he found their footwear and bikes near the entrance to the cave, but no sign of the children. Thai Navy Seals experts swam three miles into the cave network looking for the children before finding them through a previously murky and inaccessible cavern. A Royal Thai Navy commander overseeing the search previously said he was hopeful the boys and their 25-year-old coach would be rescued.

This converted Catholic church is a picture of a bustling, and clearly successful, town centre food market. But just four years ago the Sint-Amandskerk in the Belgian town of Roeselare was lying largely empty, no longer home to services yet maintained by the council with public money. It is just part of the radical transformation of the town - inspired by a British businessman’s plan to revamp local high streets. Bill Grimsey’s report on how we could save town centres was largely ignored in the UK when it was released five years ago. But in this corner of West Flanders, a city of 63,000 people decided he had the right idea on how to turn back the decline of their town centre. And on Wednesday Roeselare will be praised as an example of how towns can prepare for the future in Mr Grimsey’s second report.  So how did they do it? In 2013, like many British towns, Roeselare’s high street found itself in decline. With fewer people, spending less time and money in local shops. “Five or six years ago we saw the challenge presented by the internet and how it could change our city,” Mayor Kris Declercq says. “We knew that if we didn’t put political effort into changing the situation then our town centre would be dead. “With Bill’s report, we saw a way to transform the town and to make sure that we could make Roeselare a place people wanted to live, to raise their children.” The radical plan saw the council rethink its entire approach to how they organised the town centre. “It wasn’t about focussing on shops,” said the city’s economic director Vanessa Dehullu, “but making the town a place people wanted to spend time.  “If we increased the number of people and the time they spent here we knew the retail would follow.” The council drew up an ambitious plan to transform the city centre - building an entirely new public square with a library, renovating the Sint-Amandskerk and the surrounding area into a small green space and renovating the area around the train station. But it wasn’t all big regeneration projects - they redesigned the city’s main shopping street, the Ooststraat, introducing free ‘speedy parking’ for people spending just half an hour in town. Squares like the grand Groote Marte that were once filled with parked cars are now filled with outdoor tables from local bars and restaurants. The entire town centre is covered by free wifi. Mayor Declercq says now, five years after they launched the project, they are seeing the benefits. “People are spending more time in town - they come and they may shop for an hour. But then they are going to the library to see a concert and then they might go for a drink. “So we make the town a meeting place - people come for leisure, for culture or for dinner. But they also come to shop.” Throughout the city centre children are encouraged to play in the areas reclaimed from parking spaces - the cars are now in a nearby underground car park.  The streets are lined with flower beds and water features. “If the town is a nice place, with playgrounds and places people want to be the shops will fill themselves,” Ms Dehullu said. In the middle of a sweltering summer heatwave, people sat under shaded umbrellas enjoying a cold drink or doing some last minute shopping. And when asked about the transformation, locals were overwhelmingly positive. Madina Adamovich, 22, said the changes had restored confidence to the town. “I used to be kind of depressed about how ugly and empty it was around here - but it isn’t anymore. “The atmosphere has become a lot nicer in the city centre, it is a lot greener. “People want to come here now and come from other places - it is totally different.”  It was a view shared by Nancy Lemaitre, 42. “It is nicer to come here to do your shopping now. They put a lot of effort into making the city more attractive and it has paid off. “ But despite the herculean effort, it is not a perfect picture. On the main run of shopping streets, a number of retail units lie empty and Mayor Declercq admits there is more to be done. He said: “Dealing with vacancies is difficult, for everyone shop that opens it can feel like another closes. “We still see that there are some shops that are empty - and so we have to start again and rethink what we’ve done before.” It is this smart approach which gives Roeselare its unique feel. By offering subsidies to local businesses to move into the city centre and fining landlords who leave their property empty, they are fighting back against the decline of big chain shops.  “We don’t have a Starbucks, I have no problem with them, but I don’t think they will open here,” Ms Dehullu said “We have local coffee shops who are just as good. “Local farmers sell their products directly to consumers and we use it as a chance to teach children about agriculture and nutrition. It is about a sustainable economy .” It is this approach that attracted Nancy Windels and her husband Geert Vancayzeele to open their specialist furniture shop Vida Design in the town centre. “Without the help from the council, we would never have been able to take the risk and be able to do this,” Geert said. Standing beside him Vanessa beams with pride. “It is totally possible for towns in Britain to replicate what we have done,” she says. “In fact, I would tell them doing nothing out of fear isn’t an option.”  But she says to make it work councils must have access to cash support from central government and they must focus on delivering a project - even when people question if it is worth it. She said: “It costs money to do this. I am not naive and I know that there were questions about if this was going to be money well spent. It is our job in local government to think further ahead than tomorrow and now in Roeselare, we are seeing the fruits of our labour.” Back in the church people are sitting down for a drink, bags bulging with local fruit and veg. The once empty church is filled with the sounds of shopping and laughter. “It is simple,” says the market’s manager Melanie Vanstaen, “we gave this space back to the community and now they use it.

Christina Rickardsson\u0027s remarkable upbringing, which bears some resemblance to the Disney classic Jungle Book, saw her raised by a mother deep in the Brazilian rainforest .  The 35-year-old says she had to eat birds and berries for food and was close to starvation while living in the wilderness. She tells the story of her savage childhood an a new book, Never Stop Walking. Rickardsson reveals she once killed a street child whom she had to kill in order to survive.  Her mum, Petronilia, had brought her to the caves when she was 15 days old in April 1983 after running away from her abusive brother.  Rickardsson reveals in her book, serialised in news.au : Achingly poor, we would eat birds killed by slingshot and regularly hike to Diamantina (the nearest town) to sell dried leaves and flowers and buy rice.  I gained confidence from hunting and scavenging and still recall my immense pride when I claimed my first bird, which we grilled over our tiny fire pit. Rickardsson also describes how both she hid from man-eating jaguars saying: The growling was enough to make my mother and me shake with fear. As well as dodging poisonous snakes, spiders and scorpions, as a young girl Rickardsson had to have her wits about her living rough. Both she and her mother often begged on the streets of Sao Paulo for money where they were spat at and called \u0027cockroaches\u0027.  And aged seven, Rickardsson got in a fight with a street boy over a piece of bread from a bin. She wrote: Grappling on the ground, I heard a clinking sound next to me — a big piece of a glass bottle. I picked it up in my hand. He turned around, and without thinking, still moving, I jabbed that piece of glass at his belly as hard as I could. At first I felt nothing. Then my hand got warm. Blood gushed from the wound. I took the bread from the boy as he screamed and doubled over in pain. After I\u0027d run a fair way, I started eating. But then I started vomiting. The realisation of what I\u0027d done hit me.\u0027 Days later, Rickardsson heard a rumour that the boy had died.

Several former European and Arab ministers also attended the rally in Paris, organised by an umbrella group of opposition parties that want to end Shi\u0027ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran.

The 38-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman, identified only as Amir S and Nasimeh N, were charged with attempted terrorist murder and preparation of a terrorist act. A diplomat at the Iranian embassy in Vienna, Austria was arrested in Germany, Belgian police added. Three people of Iranian origin were also arrested in France to assess their links to the Belgium suspects.

The 12 boys and their football coach were found alive at the bottom of the cave on Monday, following a nine-day ordeal.  But the group will have to bear their ordeal for longer while rescuers work out how to bring them safely out, the governor of Chiang Rai province said on Tuesday. The youngsters, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach, disappeared after going on a hiking trip in the cave shortly before it was hit by flash-flooding, leaving them trapped underground. Nearly 900 soldiers and emergency personnel, including elite military divers and British rescue workers, were called in to find the children. The boys appeared nervous and frightened as they are discovered by the rescue team. A video shot by rescuers in flickering torchlight revealed boys clad in shorts and red and blue shirts sitting or standing on the rock above an expanse of water.  How many of you are there - 13? Brilliant, a British diver tells the youngsters. You have been here 10 days. You are very strong. Thank you, one of the boys says. One of the boys asks when they will get out of the cave, to which the rescuer answers: Not today. You have to dive. Two British divers, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, were first to reach the boys, having had strong experience in cave rescues, according to Bill Whitehouse, the vice chairman of the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC). They found the group along with a team of Thai navy SEAL divers.  Rescuers had been focusing on an elevated mound, which cavers have named Pattaya Beach, in the cave complex\u0027s third chamber, knowing that it could have provided the boys with a refuge when rains flooded the cave. The SEALs reported that ... they reached Pattaya Beach which was flooded. So they went 400 metres further where we found the 13 ... who were safe, Narongsak told the cheering group of reporters. Rescuers now have to decide how best to get the group out in their weakened condition. They have been given energy gels to sustain them while a plan is worked out to bring them to safety. Options considered included waiting until water levels subsided, or teaching the group to use diving gear to navigate the flooded cave. If you ask me now while we are still assessing all sides then I don\u0027t think they will be home soon, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters.  The group\u0027s health was assessed overnight by medical teams which will continue to check the health of the group on Monday, said Narongsak, explaining that the boys had sustained light injuries. We categorized their health condition as red, yellow or green, red being the most severe injuries, yellow being mild and green being light. Yesterday, unofficially, we assessed that most are in the green category, said Narongsak. Narongsak said rescue workers would now focus on the rescue phase and then a handover to medical teams waiting outside the cave.  The children vanished with their coach a week ago on Saturday. They are: Chanin Wiboonroongrueng, 11, Duangphet Promthep, age unknown, Phornchid Kamluang, 16, Prachuck Sutham, 14, Somphong Jaiwong, 13, Peerapat Sompiengjai, 16, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Panumart Saengdee, age unknown, Pipat Phothai, 15, Nattawoot Thakamsai, 14, Adul Samon, 14, Mongkol Boonpium, 13, and coack Ekkapol Chantawong, 25.  The youngsters, from the Wild Boars football team, were later seen with beaming smiles in photos taken by military divers who found them. The rescue workers can also be seen cheering and relatives even held a mass prayer session after hearing the good news.

I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden.

I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

The Dundee branch opened in April and we pride ourselves on offering specialised treatments while ensuring our clients feel at ease.“My role as clinic manager involves greeting our clients and making sure they are happy and also diary management which is a massive part of my day-to-day work in this very fast-paced clinic.”Treatments including botox and fillers can only be performed by a qualified prescribing nurse or a fully qualified doctor.Christine said: “We want to make sure the clients receive the best and safest treatments, that is why our procedures are carried out by professionals.“It builds trust with our clients but it also ensures safety that these practitioners know what they are doing and that is the most important thing.“We always urge people to come in for their free consultation so they can feel at ease here and can be talked through every step of the procedure.“Our practitioners will also talk through the treatments while they are happening so the client knows they are always in control.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals.

This concern has also been raised by a local member.“It is noted by one of the local members that residents of Invergowrie frequently raise concerns about the volume of traffic that uses the Main Street to avoid the Swallow roundabout in the evening peak. There is concern that the proposed scheme has the potential to cause an increase in vehicles using this route as a rat-run.“The application does not include any traffic flow modelling that could give reassurance in this regard. It is noted that drivers choose their routes based on what ‘appears faster’ and therefore might prefer to cut through Invergowrie rather than risk a relatively short delay at a traffic signal.”Ms Beer said that there had been 24 crashes on Main Street since 1999, which was more than similar villages in the area, and called for traffic surveys to be carried out if the work goes ahead. “This would allow the measurement of any resulting changes in (traffic) flow,” she added.“If there is such a change, with more vehicles travelling through Invergowrie, then a commitment to carry out any remedial works or an appropriate financial contribution should be required.”Councillor Richard McCready, whose West End ward includes the roundabout, said he had asked the council for details on the impact of the upgrade.He said: “Theoretically this should be a good thing but I don’t think the four ways you can go on this roundabout have equal traffic volumes.“I also want to make sure there are no adverse affects to the air quality in the area.”No details have yet been revealed on when the work to upgrade the roundabout will take place.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

McInnes said: “Sometimes you need those forward players to make the difference to turn one point into three.”On a positive day for McInnes, summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson also delivered solid debuts.Centre-back Mikey Devlin finally made his debut six months after signing on at Pittodrie.Devlin had been out for more than a year with a cruciate ligament damage but cruised through the game against Cobh.But it was Forrester who stole the show with the vital goal.McInnes said: “In terms of his touch and his passing ability the reason we brought Chris here was because he can be the difference.“I think Chris can be that for us either through his assists or his goals.“It is something that is important to him, to be more relevant in the final third rather than just be seen as a good passer.“Against Cobh Ramblers he was the difference with a lovely finish with his left foot.“He just shifts the ball on to it and gives us that bit of quality.“He scored a good goal and it was one that we deserved as we were the better side.”Dubliner Forrester was introduced on the half-hour mark at the Fota Island Resort.With the mercury hitting close to 30 degrees it was decided by both teams to split the match into three half-hour sections.McInnes said: “Chris is a confident boy and has to get used to the demands of us as well.“There were moments when you could see his quality.“His touch is so true, he plays with his head up and the crispness of passing is there.“Chris has some work to do to make sure his game is that bit more rounded for us.“That is the demands we are going to put on him.”Striker Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the team for the friendly having picked up knocks in training.McInnes is confident both will be fit to face Falkirk on Wednesday at Arbroath’s Gayfield stadium.The manager said: “Stevie and Sam are fine.“The ground was rock hard and maybe we over-worked them on Thursday.“Both have worked extremely well and looked sharp in the football work we have done.“It was just at the tail-end of the work on Thursday when we pushed them a wee bit.“The physios have guaranteed they will be good to go for Falkirk.”Aberdeen faced Ramblers just nine days after returning for pre-season training.In contrast the Cork-based side are midway through their domestic league.McInnes was impressed with the centre-back partnership of Devlin and Scott McKenna who never looked troubled by Cobh.However, he accepts the Reds, who hit the post through Adam Rooney, needed to be sharper up front.McInnes said: “There was a lot of good from that game.“It is a step towards where we want to be and we want to make those gradual improvements as we go along.“There was some sloppiness as you would expect.“Even though we were against a team who we were expected to beat you could see they were a bit sharper to the ball.“You could see they were a team in mid- season.“We have to make sure that we make those little steady improvements as we go along.“I can’t be disappointed as a clean sheet was never really in doubt.“We defended well and worked hard enough.“When you make so many changes in a game sometimes it upsets the fluency.“It has been a strong week for some and there is more work for some to get up to where we want.“In terms of what the players have given us since we came back in I am really pleased with their fitness levels.“I was just looking for that wee bit more quality and goal threat from the game.

operational, not only will this help the offshore wind sector to further reduce its costs through lessons learned during operations, but the output from EOWDC will itself add significantly to Scotland’s renewable electricity generating capacity, building on figures announced last month that showed installed capacity reached a record 10.4GW in the first three months of 2018 and which also

yet, with a never-ending flow of great beer, fantastic award-winning food and some absolutely brilliant bands.“The atmosphere was just great with everyone enjoying what was basically a three-day party.“Everyone at the Happening had a smile on their faces from the moment they entered our marquee to the moment they left.”The money raised by the Happening, which was held from Thursday to Saturday in a purpose-built marquee in the town’s Baird Park, also put a smile on the faces of the charities who will benefit.Stonehaven Sea Cadets, Stonehaven Amateur Swimming Club and local services of Alzheimers Scotland each received £8,000.Other donations saw £1,000 each go to Stonehaven Cycling Club, Mackie FP Rugby Club, Pillar Partnership, and Strive, the local fundraisers for rugby legend Dodie Weir’s charitable organisation.Stonehaven Lions will receive £750.With the massive clean-up operation barely complete on this year’s Happening, Robert, who is founder of Stonehaven’s Six Degrees North brewery, said organisers are already planning for Midsummer 2019.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic lights to be installed at one of dundees busiest junctions","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life. A\u0026ampB is home to many country roads enjoyed by bikers, so road safety is clearly a key issue for our team.\u0026#8217Anyone interested in learning more about the Scottish Biker Down or would like to book one of the courses can email adam.barclay@firescotland.gov.uk to book your place on the course or visit our Facebook page ‘Biker Down Scotland’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"andrews-mum-and-sis-go-the-distance-in-bid-to-find-cure","story":"THE family of a West Linton man struck down by a rare and debilitating health condition have raised almost \u0026pound10,000 with two marathon sporting challenges.\nAndrew Macnab was diagnosed last August with dermatomyositis.\nFewer than one in a million people are affected by the incurable condition which causes skin rashes, muscle weakness, and inflammatory myopathy.\nBut treatments can control the symptoms and research is ongoing to try to find a cure.\nLast month, Andrew\u0027s wee sister Helen, who lives in Stow, completed her very first marathon in Edinburgh - raising a staggering \u0026pound5,200 for Myositis UK.\nAnd just last week Andrew\u0027s mum Jean, along with her friends at West Linton Golf Club, raised a further \u0026pound4,100 with a 24-hour golfing challenge.\nThroughout the challenge Jean managed to play for the entire 24 hours - completing an amazing 140 holes.\nJean told us: \"Although I was a little weary by the end of the relay, I was over-joyed by the support and friendship from the members of West Linton Golf Club as well as many others from the village and beyond.\n\"The relay has raised funds to date of over \u0026pound4,100, providing another great boost for the funding of research by Myositis UK.\"\nBoth Jean and Helen are continuing to raise money for Mystosis UK which carries out research into the Andrew\u0027s condition.\nThe volunteer-led charity works to improve the diagnosis, treatment, understanding, and prognosis of the rare inflammatory myopathies.\nJean added: \"Andrew continues to fight against the effects of that illness, and has recently been showing small signs of improvement \u0026ndash at long last.\n\"We know that further research is essential to understand this rare illness, and find which treatments are most effective.\n\"As well as hoping that such research will improve Andrew\u0026rsquos chance of a full return to normal life, we hope that others suffering from this cruel illness can be helped.\"\nTo support Helen - www.justgiving/fundraising/helen-runs-edinburgh-marathon - or Jean - www.justgiving/fundraising/west-linton-ladies-golf - visit their justgiving pages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bins-set-alight-outside-hawick-shop","story":"WITNESSES are being sought after two bins were set alight near a shop in Hawick.\nThe fire happened at around 3.25am on Friday, June 22 on the town\u0027s High Street.\nTwo large metal wheelie bins were set alight at the rear of The Card Factory store, however quick action of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service mean the fire was extinguished before the flames could spread.\nAs a result, the outer wall and a window sustained damage, while one of the building vents was also destroyed.\nNo one was injured and inquiries are ongoing to identify whoever was responsible.\nInspector Kevin Harris from Hawick Police Station said: \"Had this fire spread then a number of homes and businesses could have been affected.\n\"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious within the High Street during the early hours of Thursday morning, or who can help us trace the culprits.\n\"Anyone with information should contact police immediately.\"\nThose with information can contact Hawick Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 426 of June 22.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716327639,16326935,16326589,16326578,16326073\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since. A number of the team are very familiar with spending time on bikes, however others in the group perhaps less so.\n\u0026ldquoEither way this was a physical and emotional challenge for each and every one of us.\nDescribed as an \u0026ldquoincredibly tough ride by Kevin, the North Coast 500 spans 516 miles across roads around the coastline in the Highlands. The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the Golspie fish and chip shop with 10 chip suppers to fuel us on our last 50 miles.\nTo donate, go to: https://bit.ly/2y4NauJ\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-highlights-wednesday-night","story":"MISSED any of the action from the festivities for the 2018 Galashiels Braw Lads Gathering?\nWatch our coverage of the events across the town on Wednesday evening (June 27) below...\nDon\u0027t forget to buy next week\u0027s Border  newspaper for photos and\u0026nbspfull reports\n"},{"url":null,"title":"post-office-launches-six-week-consultation-on-new-innerleithen-branch","story":"POST Office bosses have launched a six-week consultation on the new Innerleithen branch.\nThe move follows a confirmation of opening times for customers when the concession opens within The Allotment grocery store on Innerleithen High Street on Wednesday, August 29.\nUpon opening, the branch will open from 10am to 5pm between Monday to Friday, and from 9.30am to 1pm on Saturday.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"              Prestonpans Children\u0027s Gala Day went ahead yesterday as families braved the stormy weather to enjoy the fun.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.

After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War.

He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

The pair were honoured at a celebratory lunch in the school which was attended by colleagues.  In his speech, headteacher Colin Gerrie thanked both for their \u0026ldquolong and committed service to the school and wished them every happiness in their retirement.  Mrs Cavers, who is originally from Kirkcudbright but now lives in East Lothian, said that her 39 years at Musselburgh Grammar were a great example to pupils of \u0026ldquosticking in at school.  She is planning to travel and spend more time in her garden.  Mr Gellaitry, from Edinburgh, added: \u0026ldquoHaving taught at least two generations at Musselburgh, I feel that it is time to move on.  A speaker of nine different languages, he is hoping to travel the world now he has more leisure time.  Each guidance teacher at Musselburgh Grammar cares for about 200 pupils.  Their work involves teaching classes on internet safety, substance abuse, anti-bullying, sexual health, giving assistance to pupils on college and job applications, motivating pupils, showing commitment to pastoral care and welfare of pupils, and liaising with parents over concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"budding-provosts-receive-praise","story":"              YOUNGSTERS from across East Lothian were recognised for their entries to the \u0027If I Were Provost\u0027 competition run by East Lothian Council.  The competition, which asked young people what they would do if they were \u0026lsquoin charge\u0026rsquo, was run by the council as part of the Year of Young People.  About 200 entries were judged by Paralympic star Maria Lyle Celia Hodson, founder of Hey Girls Callum Mark, general manager at Foxlake Adventures Provost John McMillan and Councillor Shamin Akhtar, spokesperson for education and children\u0026rsquos services.  Tranent resident Ilma Ali was the winner of the 8-13-year-old category, while 15-year-old Louise Allan from Haddington won the 14-18-year-old category.  They were announced as the winners at a prizegiving ceremony in Haddington last Friday, where 16 other shortlisted entrants received prizes.  Provost John McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe were hugely impressed with the quality and range of entries that we received, which ranged from drawings to poems, comic strips to letters.  \"It was clear that everyone had really taken the challenge to heart, and had put a lot of thought and care into their entries.  \u0026ldquoThe judging panel really enjoyed the judging process, even though the task of choosing our winners was a difficult one.  \"I want to thank each and every entrant for taking part and sharing with us your ideas \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos clear that we can all play our part in improving life in East Lothian.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS \u0026lsquoglory days\u0026rsquo in the history of golf are shared with visitors to the town\u0026rsquos museum this summer.  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"              THE A198 has been closed and emergency services are at the scene after a car accident near Gullane.

A retail development with four units and a \u0026lsquodrive-thru\u0026rsquo coffee shop are proposed at the site to the west of the town, close to the Oak Tree Junction of the A1.  The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"              A COMPUTER arts student will fly halfway round the world as part of a three-person team taking part in the finals of an international Microsoft competition.

The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

North Berwick Youth Project is keen to carry out work to the run-down shelter to give their members a place to spend their time.  A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.  Next week: Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile on Hats"},{"url":null,"title":"the-big-read-what-love-island-really-says-about-the-world-we-live-in","story":"              WELCOME to Paradise. Here the sun always shines, the men have six packs, the women have curves in all the right places and the only thing you need to worry about is how much grafting (to use the show\u0027s lingo) you have to put into attracting the opposite sex.  Unless you\u0027ve been living in deep freeze, it\u0027s hard to escape the cultural phenomenon that is the Bafta-winning, dating reality TV show, Love Island. It revolves around a dizzying array of \u0026ldquosexy singles who purport to be looking for true love, along with the \u0026pound50,000 prize money (or, let\u0027s be honest, a launch pad for a celeb career), and spend up to eight weeks in a luxury villa in Mallorca trying to convince audiences that they\u0027ve found the man, or woman, of their dreams. It\u0027s knowingly narrated for laughs by Scottish comedian Iain Stirling and hosted by reality TV veteran Caroline Flack.  Whether or not it\u0027s working out for contestants, Love Island\u0027s fourth series is certainly pulling in the audiences of ITV2\u0027s dreams. An average 2.9 million people tuned in for the launch episode on June 4, more than double that of the first episode in 2017. Last week it was the highest-rating TV show at 9pm, with audiences \u0026ndash more than half of whom are in the 16-34 age range (the holy grail of TV producers) \u0026ndash peaking at 3.4million viewers. It has an overall audience share of 16 percent, that rises to almost 50 percent of younger viewers, and a whole range of merch.  Even if it sounds closer to your version of hell than paradise, there is no denying its widespread influence. But it\u0027s only a daft game show, right? As with any mainstream hit there\u0027s been plenty of sneering, about those who watch as much as those on-screen. In some ways you can see why.  In a month in which Donald Trump\u0027s immigration policies at the US border saw toddlers ripped from their mothers\u0027 arms and children kept in cages, while others were bombed in Yemen, could we really feel justified in worrying about whether Wes Nelson would be best off sticking with 29-year-old air hostess Laura Anderson or cracking on with surgically enhanced Megan Barton-Hanson? As Brexit negotiations continued to hurtle towards the cliff-edge, dragging us all towards who-knows-what, was it really OK to stuff our fingers in our ears until 9pm when we could relax into wondering if increasingly uptight and awkward A\u0026ampE doctor Alex George would finally convince a girl to fancy him?  Dr Faye Woods, lecturer in film and television at Reading University, dismisses this either/or view. She points out that while audiences of this female-targeted series are met with derision, it\u0027s not just socially acceptable, but actively expected, that men will down tools to watch the World Cup.  \u0026ldquoThis is an event bringing the nation together that isn\u0026rsquot terrible men\u0026rsquos footie, she says. \u0026ldquoLove Island gives us that space to breathe and focus on something else, a little oasis of pleasure amidst our current darkness. We can hold multiple thoughts in our brain simultaneously, and refocusing for a while every night is healthy for our well-being.  Which seems fair enough. And who doesn\u0027t like watching beautiful people? There\u0027s a fascination not just in their symmetrical features and gym-fit bodies, but in the amount of effort that goes into grooming \u0026ndash the carefully layered tans and whitened teeth, shaved chests, perfectly arched brows and painted nails (which mostly happens off camera, as if by magic).  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a kind of vicarious pleasure, reckons Gladeana McMahon, a psychological adviser for reality shows such as the early Big Brother series, and the driving force behind the production of the \u0026ldquoEthical Guidelines for Reality TV produced by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u0026ldquoThis is the gladiatorial pit without the violence.  But as she points out, ITV2 has set out to get big audiences by going for a winning formula, that is, in many ways, nostalgic and safe. While it\u0027s supposedly all about glamour and sexual sizzle \u0026ndash once you\u0027re coupled up with someone you share a double bed in the dorm and see what you can get away with under the duvet \u0026ndash this dream seems in some ways weirdly old-fashioned.  In an age in which woke millennials are seemingly increasingly accepting of gender as a fluid rather than a binary concept, the stereotypes on display \u0026ndash where men talk about treating women like queens, being \u0026ldquogentlemen, and some of the girls play dumb to get the guy \u0026ndash pull progressive views up short.  It\u0027s all about the archetypes. Adam Collard \u0026ndash trading on Garden of Eden associations and looking for temptation \u0026ndash describes himself as tall, dark and handsome, with great abs. What more could anyone want, he wonders aloud? (A little bit of respect and common decency it turns out, but more of that later.)  As Nicola Bishop, a researcher in English and television at Manchester politan University, notes: \u0026ldquoThis is \u0026lsquopin-up\u0026rsquo TV with little diversity of body types. There is a lot of readable anxiety among the male competitors about measuring up against perceived physical ideals of masculinity.  The love on this heteronormative island is not for everyone. There are lots of reality TV shows that have been very positive about representing LGBT contestants \u0026ndash Brian Dowling, winner of Big Brother\u0027s second series, is testament to that. This isn\u0027t one of them. While last year\u0027s Love Island did include a short bisexual romance between two of the women, and host Caroline Flack hinted there may be gay contestants in the future, bosses are clear. It\u0027s a dating show for straight couples and everyone needs to fancy each other. They claim they wouldn\u0027t rule out a standalone show but none is forthcoming so far.  As versions of romance go, despite the bed-swapping, it\u0027s an interestingly traditional one. Several commentators have pointed out that with its claustrophobic sense of ennui, codified courting behaviour and double-crossing, the dream on offer has more than a whiff of Jane Austen about it all.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s the Diana story, it\u0027s Cinderella, adds McMahon. Considering the number of people getting married in the UK is at an all-time low, there\u0027s an awful lot of talk about it. Adam claims there\u0027s not a girl in the house that he wouldn\u0027t want as a wife, while Laura hints to 20-year-old Wes, after sharing a bed with him for a few weeks, that she\u0027s on the look-out for a husband.  While in the real world there might be an increasing acceptance of less traditional relationships, or even non-monogamous ones, what\u0027s on offer here is what writer and columnist Laurie Penny refers to as Love TM. This search for Mr or Mrs Right is what she calls \u0026ldquothe narrow romantic fantasy that trumps all other forms of love, which is put on a pedestal as the answer to all our life problems and insecurities and never questioned. As beautiful lawyer Rosie Williams, ditched by Adam, cries to the other girls \u0026ldquoI just want to be enough, you wish she already knew she was.  It is her experience too that shows the darker side of the fairytale \u0026ndash Hans Christian Andersen rather than Disney \u0026ndash with Women\u0027s Aid going as far as issuing a warning about spotting the signs of abuse in response to Adam\u0027s \u0026ldquogaslighting of her (a term used to describe psychological manipulation aimed at making someone question their version of reality). The charity said there were clear warning signs in Adam\u0027s behaviour of emotional abuse and called on viewers to speak out against unhealthy relationships.  Faye Woods claims that though it\u0027s \u0026ldquodistressing emotionally to watch this play out on television, it\u0027s been valuable \u0026ldquoin terms of understanding and awareness of everyday behaviour. She adds: \u0026ldquoI think of all the people who may have dismissed coercive control, but then saw it in practice with Adam and Rosie and then understood it.  Then there\u0027s the issue of race. From the off it was not lost on black women writers and commentators such as Danielle Dash who noticed the way the statuesquely beautiful Samira Mighty \u0026ndash the only black woman in the house \u0026ndash was over-looked by all the boys and ended up with Alex because he\u0027d been usurped in his first choice by another man. On Friday, with another cohort of boys arriving in the villa resolutely uninterested in her, she finally broke down claiming to be \u0026ldquoso confused.  On the outside there is less confusion as people fit the pieces together. There\u0027s the way the public \u0026ldquoforgot to vote for singer Alexandra Burke, who outdanced all her competitors week after week on Strictly Come Dancing and repeatedly ended up in the dance off, the black girls passed over in dating show Take Me Out, the racist incidents in Big Brother House\u0027s gone by. Reality TV, argue many, has form.  Dr Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, hasn\u0027t watched it but isn\u0027t surprised by the concerns. \u0026ldquoReality TV is popular because it resonates with people, he says. \u0026ldquoSo we shouldn\u0027t be surprised when it replicates the racism that we see in society. Actually television often shows a world that is artificially equal. It\u0027s very rare now that something like Midsomer Murders \u0026ndash showing an all-white world \u0026ndash will be commissioned. So we sometimes get a distorted view when in actual fact the country is really segregated. In reality TV we see the reality that society is dominated by ideas of white supremacy.  It\u0027s not just the way the characters interact \u0026ndash it\u0027s also the way it\u0027s cast and edited, he claims. \u0026ldquoIf you look at who made the show, who picked the characters, who commissioned it in the first place, you\u0027ll probably find that it reflects a bias, he adds. \u0026ldquoThey [producers] should be mindful of that, more responsible. But fixing Love Island isn\u0027t going to do anything. It\u0027s a symptom of the problem.  Though unlikely to start viewing now, he admits it\u0027s probably more important than some give it credit for. It\u0027s certainly important to the millions of fans, following contestants\u0027 Instagram accounts in their droves, live-tweeting their own social commentary, or dissecting it with their mates on group chat. On Twitter there\u0027s support for Samira, complaints about Adam and other men\u0027s behaviour towards the women, and of course the inevitable backlash, calling out double standards. Discussion around the \u0026ldquosexual shaming of the women, when contestants were asked to share the number of people they\u0027d slept with, was red hot. On screen Laura\u0027s 30 was initially met with embarrassed silence, while Adam\u0027s 200 with backslapping.  Yet writing in the Times earlier this month Caitlin Moran claimed it is that interaction that makes Love Island an unlikely vehicle for feminism \u0026ldquobecause we live in an era when every one of the classic tactics used by these men \u0026ndash gaslighting, denial, coercion, guilt \u0026ndash is met with a fabulous deconstruction on social media. For the first time we have live, rolling footage of total ledges trying the kind of mindf***y shenanigans that previously have happened in the privacy of bars or the back of cabs ... That smirk! If you see a man smirk like that, leave immediately by the nearest exit, for you are dealing with a human trash-fire.  Online chat is also about spotting who is genuine (ie the loveable Dani Dyer and her boyfriend, stationery salesman Jack Fincham, whose loyalty during separation had hearts melting) and who is faking it. Who is merely playing the game? It\u0027s a rolling audience commentary that underlines the fact that just being young doesn\u0027t make you dumb.  As Faye Woods says: \u0026ldquoReality TV is never real, and all viewers know this. It is non-viewers who attempt to dismiss them as gullible. Reality TV is built for savvy, sophisticated viewers, who are able to pivot effortlessly between awareness of this as constructed process and an emotional immersion.  Paradise, then, might be a great way to switch off. But, it turns out, Paradise deconstructed might have plenty to tell us about our society and youth culture today, as long as we\u0027re ready to listen."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8004636.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iona-christian-community-in-final-bid-to-save-facilities","story":"              It is described as cradle of Christianity in Scotland.  In 563 AD the Irish monk, St Columba set up a monastic community on the tiny isle of Iona.  Since then it has become a haven for pilgrims, welcoming some 1,500 guests to its Hebridean shores every year.  However recently the fate of the historical abbey precinct has been plunged into doubt after the Christian group based on the island said it has veered dangerously into disrepair.  The Iona Community has said that years of heavy use have taken their toll on the residential facilities at the island\u0027s abbey, with a recent survey revealing that \"without some urgent repairs and long-term major investment, they would be unfit for purpose within seven years\".    It is now launching a final push of its Iona Abbey Capital project to help raise the last \u0026pound500,000 by the end of this year.  On its completion, the project will deliver improved access, new bedrooms and fully accessible shower rooms and toilets, as well as improved insulation and washing facilities at the centrer.  Current \u0026lsquoprivate\u0026rsquo spaces in Iona Abbey will also become accessible to the public as part of the project.  Reverend Kathy Galloway, the joint leader of the Iona Community, said the group had now completed phase one of the works, and now needed more help to fully fund phase two.  She said: \"We want to adapt the living areas to be accessible for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues.  \"We also want to install a renewable energy heating system and winter proof the building so that we can extend our season to welcome more visitors and volunteers each year. At the moment, many rooms are too cold to use past October.\"    Iona Abbey in 1953  Already, \u0026pound3 million has been raised for the project, including \u0026pound300,000 in the month of May alone.  Working in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and Iona Renewables, it also aims to provide a renewable energy heating system, through a progressive, community-led energy project.  The group said they are now in the position to begin phase two earlier than expected, which will lead to substantial savings, meaning the refurbished project will be ready to open a year early in 2020.  Reverend Galloway said: \"The Iona Community wants to continue to welcome people to share life in community for generations to come, and to make sure we are accessible for all.  \"This complex, exciting project will ensure people from around the world can continue to share in the community\u0026rsquos life within the historic setting and beauty of Iona,\" she said.  In 1938, the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona in order to rebuild the monastic quarters of the medieval abbey.  Set in the context of the poverty of the Depression, he brought together unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to serve as a sign of hopeful rebuilding of community in urban Scotland, aiming to rebuild \"the common life by working and living together, sharing skills and effort as well as joys and achievement\".  This has shaped the practice and principles of the group, which acts as an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Church engaged together.    Outside Iona Abbey in 1953  Since its completion in 1965, the monastery remains a centre for pilgrimage and tourism, with the community now running three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull.  Now, there is a year-round population of more than 100, including long-established island families as well as more recent arrivals, including those who work for the Iona Community in its centres as staff or volunteers.  Guests come to stay on the island to contemplate and pray, and play a significant role in the island\u0026rsquos economy.  Daily services of the Iona Community are undertaken in the Abbey church, with abbey itself managed by Historic Environment Scotland  Built of stone and slate, the buildings of the Iona Abbey Centre were originally the living quarters of the monks and have retained a distinctly monastic feel.  However, in a report sent to the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos general assembly two years ago, the Iona Community said that \"piecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs.\"  As of this year, both the Abbey Centre and the MacLeod centre -- a newer building on the island, have been closed to residential guests.  Reverend Galloway said the group was hopeful that \"people in Scotland and beyond will recognise the great need to safeguard Iona Abbey as a living place of hospitality, and ensure that thousands more people can visit this special place seeking sanctuary and inspiration\".    The Refectory  In 563AD, the Irish monk Columba (Columkille) established a monastic settlement on the island of Iona, leading to large parts of Scotland and the north of England to become evangelised.  As an important centre of European Christianity, it became the site of a Benedictine abbey in the Middle Ages and for centuries it has attracted thousands of people on their own pilgrim journeys.  The Abbey also has a substantial collection of stone crosses which date back to within 200 years of its founding, some of which show Celtic influences thought to come from Ireland.  The carved stones include St John\u0027s Cross and St Oran\u0027s Cross, and a cross slab created 100 years later.  The crosses are thought to be among the finest examples of such sculpture to survive.  Others bear the stamp of the Vikings who first raided Iona in 794 AD."},{"url":null,"title":"learner-drivers-should-have-to-spot-potholes-to-pass-test","story":"              Learner drivers should have to prove they can spot potholes to pass the test, according to a motoring firm.  The AA wants poor road surfaces to be included in the hazard perception test because of the damage they cause to vehicles.  It also called for advice on what to do when drivers encounter a pothole to be added to the Highway Code.  One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition as councils face a huge funding deficit to tackle potholes, a recent report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance warned.  Hazard perception is part of the theory driving test and involves candidates identifying something that would cause them to take action such as slow down or change direction in 14 video clips.  The pass rate of the practical driving test fell to a nine-year low of 45% after changes to make the exam more realistic were introduced in December last year.  The AA advises motorists who spot a pothole to:  - Slow down if necessary but keep an eye on the rear view mirror  - Stay in lane  - Avoid big swerves  A survey of a small sample of driving instructors found that the majority have broken down during a lesson at least once in the past 12 months because of pothole-related damage, and many have to adapt lessons to avoid certain roads where there are too many potholes.  Some learners have even had to abandon a practical driving test because their car was damaged by a pothole, the AA was told.  Damage to tyres, wheels and suspension are the most common problems.  AA president Edmund King said: \"It is a sad indictment of our poor road conditions that instructors are having to adapt their lessons to avoid potholed roads.  \"More troubling is the fact that lessons and tests are being abandoned because of pothole related breakdowns.  \"This is damaging to learners\u0027 confidence and to instructors whose livelihoods depend on having a fit-for-purpose road network and an undamaged car.  \"The situation is so serious that the hazard perception test and Highway Code need to change to reflect the state of the roads that learner drivers have to learn on.  \"There is no advice for drivers about potholes anywhere in the Highway Code yet it is one of the most common hazards they encounter.\"  Drivers are being urged to photograph potholes and send them to the responsible highway authority and the Department for Transport to demonstrate the scale of the issue as part of the AA\u0027s #FlagitFunditFillit campaign.  The Government said the DVSA keeps the driving test under constant review to make it as effective as possible.  It said in a statement: \"We have listened to the concerns of road users and are already providing councils in England with over \u0026pound6 billion to help improve the condition of our local highways.  \"This funding includes a record \u0026pound296 million through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around six million potholes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-business-secretary-hints-brexit-transition-period-could-be-extended-beyond-2020","story":"              THE Business Secretary has added to the tensions inside Theresa May\u0026rsquos divided cabinet by suggesting the post-Brexit transition may have to be extended.  Greg Clark said the status-quo period, which is due to end in December 2020, some 21 months after the UK formally leaves the EU, should be set by \u0026ldquofacts and evidence.  He suggested new computer systems and other border controls might not be ready by 2020.  On Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Mr Clark, who has said practical business concerns must come before ideology on Brexit, refused to rule out an extension.  He said: \"At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run [the port of Dover and Eurotunnel]... there are things that would need to be put in place, computer systems for example posts at the border, even if they checked, automatically number plates.  \"What we need assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice. It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.  His comments were echoed by Andrea Leadsom, who said 2020 was \u0026ldquonot a magical date.  The leader of the Commons said 2020 \u0026ldquoshould be long enough but \u0026ldquoremains under review.  She told told HuffPost UK: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos been agreed is the end of December 2020. And it\u0026rsquos not a magical figure, a magical date. It\u0026rsquos just what has been agreed with the EU.  \u0026ldquoI personally think it should be long enough. That\u0026rsquos my view. It\u0026rsquos fine as it is. We don\u0026rsquot need for any particular reason to extend it.  \u0026ldquoBut I think it remains under review. As all sides make very clear, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The idea of extending the period the UK in which maintains much of its relationship with the EU, while losing influence in Brussels, is an incendiary one for Brexiters, who fear it would postpone new trade deals and prolong freedom of movement, creating \u0026lsquoBrino\u0026rsquo, or Brexit in name only.  It is also likely to worsen the break-down in cabinet discipline ahead of this Friday\u0026rsquos crunch meeting at Chequers, where Mrs May hopes to finalise the UK blueprint for Brexit.  Brexiteers oppose the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.  However both options have been dismissed by the EU.  It emerged at the weekend that Brexiter Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically ripped up an official report suggesting he had come round to the customers partnership plan.  Asked if the customs partnership option was still on the table, Mr Clark said: \"Yes.\"  The chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, publicly pleaded for government unity.  Writing in the Observer, he said his party risked looking divided and letting in Labour.  He said: \u0026ldquoElectorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for divided parties. They rejected decisively the divided Tory party in 1997.  \u0026ldquoIf we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.  Damian Green, Mrs May\u0026rsquos former deputy, also attacked the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos fractious cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have seen threats against her, attacks on business, and cabinet ministers taking the proverbial out of each other\u0026rsquos policies. All of this in full public gaze. It has been an unedifying spectacle of oversized egos showing they are not fit to be officers.  Housing minister James Brokenshire admitted there were \u0026ldquostrong views on either side of the cabinet over Brexit, but he remained confident the Friday meeting at Chequers would end with a \u0026ldquoclear direction and a white paper published the week after.

The red-legged seriema - named Elvis - was rushed to a specialist facility after her keepers at Blair Drummond Safari Park noticed that she was unusually quiet and struggling to eat.  A CT scan at the University of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies revealed the screw in her stomach and vets quickly removed it with the help of a miniature camera.  Vet Dr Bronwyn Koterwas, of the Exotic Animal and Wildlife Medicine and Surgery service at the university, said: \u0026ldquoElvis was very poorly when she came to us.  \u0026ldquoThanks to our advanced scanning equipment and dedicated team of experts working across departments we were able to rapidly spot what was wrong.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted that Elvis has left the building and has returned safely to Blair Drummond.  Red-legged seriemas are native to South America and stand around a metre tall, thanks to their distinctive spindly legs.  The birds are very inquisitive and often peck at foreign objects, which can prove harmful to their health.  In Elvis\u0026rsquo case, her keepers quickly realised that she as in trouble and called in expert help from the university straight away.  Working quickly, they tested the bird\u0026rsquos blood and referred her for a high-powered CT scan.  The screw was removed without the need for invasive surgery and Elvis was able to return to Blair Drummond the day after she was admitted and is now doing well.  Sheila Walker, Animal Collection Manager at Blair Drummond, said: \u0026ldquoIt is imperative that when any of our animals are sick that they are seen by vets with expertise and the experience necessary to treat the species and we are very fortunate that the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is only a short drive away.  \u0026ldquoElvis does a short walk from her aviary to the presentation ground and we think that is where she possibly picked up the screw.  \u0026ldquoOur keepers now do a quick sweep of the track before bringing her out."},{"url":null,"title":"exciting-progress-in-development-of-artificial-ovaries","story":"              Scientists have made \u0026ldquoexciting progress in the development of artificial ovaries to help preserve women\u0026rsquos fertility.  Immature eggs have been shown for the first time in a laboratory to survive on ovarian tissue which was removed from cancer patients before treatment and stripped of cells, researchers said.  It is hoped this engineered structure could be re-implanted into women and restore fertility after they have completed chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Scientists from the Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen, Denmark, proved the graft worked when using human tissue transplanted into mice.  Experts said the research, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) annual meeting in Barcelona, \u0026ldquoholds much promise for the future.  Many cancer treatments can damage the ovaries, stopping the body from producing eggs and meaning a woman cannot get pregnant. Women dealing with a diagnosis can choose to have their eggs frozen, while some doctors may offer to remove or freeze all or part of an ovary so it can be transplanted back after treatment.  However, there is a small chance that grafted ovarian tissue could reintroduce cancer cells.  A \u0026ldquobio-engineered ovary would reduce this risk, the research team from Rigshospitalet said.  Their experiments used ovarian tissue removed from women trying to preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. The cells from the tissue were eliminated using chemicals, leaving behind a \u0026ldquobio-engineered scaffold on which the early-stage egg-containing follicles were reseeded.  Dr Susanne Pors, who presented the research, said: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularised human scaffold and, as a proof-of-concept, it could offer a new strategy in fertility preservation without risk of malignant cell recurrence.  Experiments in which the structure was transplanted into mice showed it could support the survival and growth of the follicles.  Commenting on the research, Professor Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women\u0026rsquos Clinic, said it was an \u0026ldquoexciting development.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove been able to show that they can then introduce back into that tissue stored follicles and early-growth eggs, that then appear to grow in that material that\u0026rsquos had all the cells removed, he said.  \u0026ldquoAnd, that this can then be placed back into the body and hopefully allow women to re-establish their cycles to possibly conceive, either naturally or with IVF, while reducing this risk of cancer.  He said the technique was \u0026ldquolikely to develop into something that will be potentially useful, but said further research was needed to prove it will work in humans.  Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said \u0026ldquoIf this is shown to be effective, it offers huge advantages over IVF and egg freezing."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-bosses-urged-to-rethink-hire-of-sheridan-apologist","story":"              LABOUR\u0026rsquoS top Scottish and UK officials have been asked to rethink the party\u0026rsquos hiring of a former spokesman for perjurer Tommy Sheridan.  The Scottish Labour Women\u0026rsquos Movement (SLWM), which include MPs and MSPs, has formally raised the recent appointment of Jim Monaghan as a party organiser in Scotland.  Mr Monaghan, who was a spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign and believes the former Socialist MSP was the victim of a conspiracy, is being paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to promote \u0026ldquosocial change.

Mr Sheridan successfully sued Rupert Murdoch\u0026rsquos News International in 2006 for \u0026pound200,000 after the former News of the World paper claimed he was a swinger and an adulterer.  However at a subsequent criminal trial a jury found he had lied under oath during his defamation action.  During both cases, Mr Sheridan labelled his many female accusers as liars, infuriating former colleagues.  The defamation case led to a split in the Scottish Socialists and Mr Sheridan forming his breakaway Solidarity party, which Mr Monaghan also joined.  The SLWM are now raising concerns about Mr Monaghan\u0026rsquos post with UK general secretary Jennie Formby and Scottish general secretary Brian Roy.  In social media messages, it said: \u0026ldquoThere is no political party that has achieved more for women than Labour but the inequalities and challenges still facing women and girls mean we need to work harder than ever to be their champion. This means everyone in our party should respect women.  \u0026ldquoMisogyny and sexism are the enemies of women and have no place in the Labour Party. We expect members, staff and elected representatives to actively demonstrate what they are doing to advance equality for women.  \u0026ldquoIn response to questions raised by the UK Labour Party\u0026rsquos appointment and his involvement in the Tommy Sheridan trial\u0026hellip we will be writing to Jennie Formby and Brian Roy.

During questions in the Commons, he asked the Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation what the UK Government is doing to increase the take-up of STEM subjects - guaranteeing a generation of well-equipped workers.        Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Tuesday 3 Jul 2018 3:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.            Addressing the audience, Kerr Okan, said: “Glasgow you look so good in the sunshine! Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd. This felt like a real tipping point performance that people will be talking about for years to come.

I am a unionist with a lower case “u”.             By that I mean I am not committed to any one unionist party and am willing to give non-unionist parties a fair hearing if they apply liberal, low tax, small government policies in Scotland, because I believe these are what will most likely deliver as harmonious and prosperous a Scotland for the vast majority of its people as is practicably possible.            Nor do I support unionism because I think an independent Scotland could not succeed one just has to look at other smaller countries to see that if Denmark or Norway can do well then surely so could Scotland – if it lived within its means.No, I am unionist because I am at home with being Scottish and British. It was in my mother’s milk that I suckled on it was in my rearing through infancy and schooldays and my travelling around the UK as a youth and then an undergraduate. I have rejoiced in our rich and diverse cultural history during my British holidays, just as I enjoy the internal home nations’ rivalries or competition between Scotland’s cities or the Highlands and Lowlands. I can see the good in them and the faults in them, but I do see and feel a tangible unifying oneness, a bond that I cannot let go of.So when I see the bitter divisions that came out of the first independence referendum – the splitting of families, the loss of friends and the rising tide of implied or discreet threats, sometimes with genuine menace – then I fear what another independence referendum could do to our country. At the age of 60 this year, I do not think the psychological wounds of 2014 will be healed before I leave this Earth – were there to be a second referendum then I have absolutely no doubt it will be ugly and the scarring divisions that much greater. Yet I have to tell you I also believe there will be another and it will not be pretty, and whatever the outcome it will need real leadership to bring about a healing. Sadly, there are few leaders of any humility or calibre that I think could achieve such a highly desirable role.I believe there will be another independence referendum because all the signs point to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wishing and now needing it to be so, and for good or ill she will instigate it.             The original SNP strategy was that if, when in government, it could show a SNP-run Scotland was no worse or maybe even slightly better than the Labour-Liberal Democrat administrations before, then independence might not seem such an undesirable leap. On many issues this meant the SNP actually did very little it promised for instance, the council tax was not abolished in favour of a local income tax, nor were students loans written off.When in 2011 the SNP won its overall majority it still did not seek to frighten the horses for fear of losing potential supporters for independence. Other than centralising institutions (under the mistaken guise of saving money), public service reform was studiously avoided. Scotland was in stasis while the independence White Paper, Scotland’s Future, was published, and following the 55-45 defeat no ­serious public service reform has followed.The SNP is essentially averse to challenging the vested interests in health and education, for to do so must force some people to be against them when they need to build a coalition for Yes (or more likely “Leave”) the second time round.After 11 years of SNP government we are therefore at a point where, under its watch, education is much worse with falling numeracy and literacy and collapsing international rankings expose the truth of this the Scottish NHS too is failing with the worst cancer treatment times in history and four health boards now requiring emergency loans totalling over £70 million just to get by meanwhile the iconic Queensferry Crossing yet again requires further remedial work that will disrupt traffic all summer and our public roads now have more craters than the surface of the Moon.             These are just some examples, for when you turn over any Scottish Government stone the problems come crawling out like clipshears and wood lice.Last week Sturgeon had a shambolic ministerial reshuffle that was bad on two counts. Firstly, she appointed a narcissist tweeter with a criminal conviction as Justice Secretary, when the role requires a solemn and judicious politician with a character, like Caesar’s wife, that is beyond suspicion. Secondly she not only retained her financial secretary, Derek Mackay, who has presided over a growing black hole that no quantum physicist can explain, she actually added to his brief. Ultimately this void will swallow up her government. Then she retained her Education Secretary, John Swinney, when by the evidence of his own inactions he has utterly failed to deliver the necessary reforms for what is claimed to be her “number one priority” of schooling.That was before the wheels came of the reshuffle tea trolley with the withdrawal of Gillian Martin as education minister.             The strategy for a second independence referendum was originally to use any and every grievance with Westminster – and where none existed, to create some – so momentum for a referendum could then be held. That is clearly not working. Nor by 20,000 leagues is the original model of demonstrating competence.All that is now left is for Sturgeon to take us into a second referendum – with or without Westminster’s necessary legal consent – so she can polarise the country and thus galvanise personal support to have any chance of the SNP remaining the largest party after the next Holyrood elections in 2021.Glorious victory – or more likely, glorious defeat whatever the cost to Scotland – is worth it if it means remaining in control of government. No longer is a second referendum about winning independence, it is about retaining power. Scotland will be thrown to the wolves to whip up division so in the aftermath disappointed supporters will flock to the SNP. Sturgeon cares not for the country’s harmony, prosperity or public services – she cares only for the SNP being in position to have a third tilt at independence.Such is the sorry state of our nation. I hope and pray I am wrong.• Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762976.1530556748!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis media is doing its job over brexit dark money","story":"\t\tDUP Brexit spending raises concerns about the law, not about how it was reported, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.\t\t\t\tIn the final days of the EU referendum campaign, the Democratic Unionist Party paid for a wrap-around advert in the , calling on voters to “take back control”.            The message reached far beyond Northern Ireland, where the  isn’t even sold, and should have been far beyond their means – an advert like that costs more than a quarter of a million pounds. The DUP spent less than £100,000 on an entire devolved election campaign in 2016.            In fact, the party that now keeps the Conservatives in power spent an incredible £425,000 on Brexit, buying a lot besides newspaper advertising. How they came into that money might have remained a secret, but for intense political and media pressure.Electoral rules in Northern Ireland did not, until recently, require parties to declare where they had got their money from – a legacy of the Troubles. We might never have found out that the DUP’s Brexit campaign was bankrolled by the Constitutional Research Council (CRC), a shadowy group headed by a former Scottish Conservative Party chairman and parliamentary candidate, Richard Cook.The CRC doesn’t file accounts and has no public face. We have no idea where it gets its money – and the only person who knows, Cook, isn’t saying. Meanwhile, his own business dealings have come under intense scrutiny.READ MORE: SNP calls for investigation into ‘shady business’ of Vote Leave fundingAll of this has been reported over the past 18 months. The journalists Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay, writing for Open Democracy, have been the most dogged, but they’ve been abetted by other outlets.            The latest revelations about Cook’s previous activities were the product of an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland, and were picked up and reported by BBC Scotland. Cook is an elusive character, but was doorstepped by Channel 4 News and challenged to reveal where the CRC’s money came from. When the CRC was first named by the DUP, the news was splashed on the front page of the Herald, and the story had also been reported by its sister paper, the Sunday Herald, and other publications, including The Scotsman.The DUP donation has been linked to wider claims of cooperation between different Brexit campaigns in breach of electoral spending law, stemming from the widely reported Cambridge Analytica controversy. The central allegation is that money was passed to different groups to avoid legal spending limits – a claim that has been denied, but which is under investigation by the Electoral Commission.The facts are that the DUP spent £32,000 with data firm AIQ, which also received 40 per cent of the official Vote Leave campaign budget, as well as nearly £675,000 from another campaign group, BeLeave. When the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie told MPs he was “absolutely convinced” the spending represented a breach of electoral law, that was reported in The Scotsman.All this serves as a lengthy run up to this: when Nicola Sturgeon echoed the Twitter hordes by saying she was “surprised there aren’t more media questions being asked” about what the SNP is calling ‘dark money’, I shared her surprise.            Engaging with people who question the how, why and why not of stories in the Scottish media is usually pointless – they are almost always motivated by political partisanship, a deep attachment to conspiracy theory, and a lack of understanding about how the news today works. Those traits shouldn’t be encouraged.If critics want to see what is a complicated story delved into more deeply, then they have to accept that the biggest problem with the so-called ‘mainstream’ media in Scotland is that there isn’t enough of it – that sort of work takes resources, mainly time. Many of the wounds of the media industry were self-inflicted. It doesn’t help for elected politicians to keep punching them. Above all, the details already uncovered in the story of the DUP’s Brexit cash have amply demonstrated that rules around political donations lack transparency, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. In a world were ‘calling out’ something is seen as akin to political action, the media’s critics have somehow convinced themselves the problem is that not enough is being written. Actually, it’s that not enough is being done. That’s not our department."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762728.1530546843!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish government set to ban deals on sweets and crisps","story":"\t\tSupermarkets in Scotland are set to be banned from running special offers on unhealthy foods, under plans announced by ministers to tackle the nation\u0026#8217s obesity crisis. \t\t\t\tThe proposals mean that shoppers will soon be unable to take advantage of buy-one-get-one-free deals on sweets, biscuits, crisps, cakes and sugary soft drinks.            An action plan published by the Scottish Government says shops should be stopped from providing “triggers” that encourage customers to indulge in food high in fat, salt and sugar.            Around a fifth of the average Scottish person’s daily calorie intake comes from so-called “discretionary foods” with little or no nutritional value, it adds. READ MORE: Scots toddlers eat a million sweets a weekThe plans will be set out in more detail in the autumn ahead of a public consultation, but the document sets out a number of ways in which the issue is likely to be tackled. READ MORE: In Pictures: 16 sweets you’ll remember if you grew up in ScotlandAs well as banning multi-buy deals on unhealthy foods, restrictions could also be placed on unlimited refills of sugary drinks and the offer of incentives such as a free toy or loyalty points.             Lunchtime meal deals, which see shoppers encouraged to buy a drink and crisps or snack alongside a sandwich for a fixed price, could also come to an end as a result of the plans. However, the action plan says restrictions will only apply to foods with “little or no essential nutrients”, meaning that popular foods such as pizzas may escape the ban. Being overweight or obese ‘the norm’ The document warns that being overweight or obese is now “the norm” for Scottish adults, with almost two-thirds (65 per cent) in this category – a figure largely unchanged in the last decade.             It says Scots live increasingly sedentary lifestyles and are “bombarded” by messages encouraging them to eat unhealthily, adding that simply relying on people to change their habits themselves is not enough. It proposes the creation of an advertising code of practice which would restrict junk food advertising at bus shelters, train stations and on public transport. The new strategy also focuses on children and early years, with plans for a pre-conception campaign to encourage women to start pregnancy at a health weight. “Far too many people in Scotland face serious risks to their health linked to poor diet and unhealthy weight,” said public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick. “This is unacceptable and it’s largely avoidable. Scotland has a proud history of taking decisive action on public health and this is the next step in that journey.”             The plans were welcomed by healthy eating campaigners, but Cancer Research UK said it was “vital” that they led to enforceable laws so supermarkets were compelled to take action. The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed what it described as a “U-turn” from ministers on banning two-for-one pizza deals. “That was ill-thought through and would have hit families simply trying to buy an affordable meal that adults and children can enjoy,” said the party’s health spokesman Miles Briggs.This story first appeared on our sister site iNews."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

There\u0026#8217s no holidays and no rest, it\u0026#8217s a condition you have to face every day.\u0026#8221\nOnhausz is perhaps best known for his daredevil stunts scaling the likes of Scalloway Castle while kitted out in superhero outfits. But he is also a painter of considerable talent.\nHis previous exhibits have seen him paint picture-perfect likenesses of musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and movie monsters such as Frankenstein.\nThis time Onhausz has taken inspiration from something a little closer to home, his job with Scottish Sea Farms.\n.\nBalazs Onhausz with the centrepiece of his latest art exhibition.

The wooden boat was taking in water in rough seas in the Roost.\n into Lerwick harbour.\nShetland Coastguard watch officer Alex Dodge said: “The 14 on board were all safe and well. The skipper handled the situation extremely well.”\nThe 40-year-old converted fishing boat, with an all-female crew and female passengers, was heading to Shetland for a diving trip, and will be in the isles for the next few weeks.\n since January last year and has 22 years experience as a power boat instructor, said she called the coastguard as a precaution.\n was [originally] a fishing boat and well able for the conditions.”\nThe problem started when the boat began taking in water from the rudder gland and a deck hatch, she said. The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
