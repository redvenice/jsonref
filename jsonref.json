He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.There is something about what he calls the “chaos and the lightness and good-naturedness of ordinary Russians” that he tries to frame in different ways. The contrasts between the pictures he takes are as important as the contrasts within them. “I was always interested in shooting single photographs,” he says, “which show worlds and stories in one image.” He finds the classical reportage style, where you photograph 30 images of a story in series, too repetitive. “I think you can skip the before, after and in between. This is for me photography, the art of using just one frame.”Russian Fairytales by Frank Herfort will be published by Kerber Verlag (£36) later this spring"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8690b87cf92c7a26fa1325d37f92ad9ae0d6cd78/0_167_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=269359cada3a2f57034754e16f3c0fce","title":"art world coronavirus pandemic online artists galleries","story":"The glitzy fairs and blockbuster shows are history, replaced with Zoom studio tours and virtual exhibitions. Might this actually mark an improvement? In the first week of March, New York’s Armory Show opened on schedule, as it has done for the past 26 years. Despite coronavirus concerns, gallerists and collectors from across the globe packed Piers 90 and 94 on the West Side of Manhattan for one of the ritziest art fairs in the calendar. Big sales were made – a painting by the superstar contemporary painter Kehinde Wiley went for $280,000 (£220,000) – and the organisers congratulated themselves on not surrendering to the fearmongers (“New Yorkers are strong,” concluded the fair’s director, Nicole Berry). Aside from the absence of air-kissing and the prevalence of hand sanitiser, it was hard to spot anything amiss.Only a month later, the Armory Show looks like the last days of the Roman Empire. Days after it closed, European countries had gone into lockdown. Art fairs elsewhere were being cancelled by the dozen and auctions postponed. By mid-March, galleries worldwide had locked their doors haemorrhaging income, many started furloughing or laying off staff. New York itself has become the epicentre of the North American outbreak. And Pier 90 is now famous for a grimmer reason: it’s where a US Navy hospital ship is moored.There isn’t a business worldwide that hasn’t felt the virus’s impact, with calamitous results for millions. And the art world has been far from immune. An industry that has become synonymous with hyper-connectedness and global mobility is now, like the rest of us, at a standstill. The art market is idling. The places where we experience art – from leading museums to the tiniest independent spaces – are abruptly out of bounds. Many galleries are likely to go out of business artists will lose livelihoods. A recent piece by the New York magazine art critic, Jerry Saltz, carried an apocalyptic headline: The Last Days of the Art World.“It’s a pivotal moment,” suggests Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern, when we speak. “We’re going to talk in terms of before and after. The virus will change a lot of things for art.”But what sort of changes, and what sort of things? Is there only emptiness on the horizon, or are there opportunities, too? And when we finally emerge, what will art – and, yes, the art world – look like?“It’s unprecedented,” says Alison Cole, editor of industry bible the Art Newspaper. “After talking about it for years, a lot of people are finally seizing the opportunity of online.”Social media has been part of the art world for a while. But with physical galleries now empty it’s suddenly the sole means for organisations to retain a connection to audiences. The most august institutions are revealing a more unbuttoned, down-to-earth side: the Royal Academy Twitter feed, previously full of earnest promos for RA events, has been taken over by an #RAdailydoodle challenge aimed at amateur artists (sample post: “Who can draw us a thirsty ferret?”). Other galleries are trialling similar projects – less top-down, more collaborative.Morris at Tate detects a deep shift: “Having a real conversation with real people is hugely exciting. I think it’s partly because people are missing the social space of being in a museum. It’s something we haven’t always done enough. And once we reopen, we get a chance to recalibrate that.”The same is true behind the scenes, she adds: the fact that the hectic merry-go-round of openings and events has paused means that it’s possible to get hold of people. “Everyone seems more available, perversely. I’ve been having conversations with colleagues from all over the world.”Beneath all this, of course, there is a grim reality: money. With the global economy stalled, the wealth that has fuelled the art world for the past 20 years – a period of discombobulating growth, museum expansions, soaring auction prices, more art fairs by the month – is suddenly in doubt.“It feels like we’ve been partying for the last two decades,” says Morris. The commercial gallerist David Zwirner, who now has spaces in New York, Hong Kong, London and Paris, concurs: “It got out of hand, especially the market: crazy auction prices and the rest. The infiltration of value into the perception of art, art being regarded as an asset – all that needs to be rethought.”Is he fearful for the future? “Of course. There’s going to be a lot of pain, especially for smaller galleries. And, of course, artists.”Cole is similarly anxious: “At the top end, the art world is a luxury industry, but many of the people who work in it – the artists, the handlers, gallery staff – are in very precarious positions. We published an article the other day saying that a third of French galleries could close by the end of 2020. Even if the art market bounces back, it’s going to be a much smaller world.”Yet, while accounting for these very real hardships – local museums in the UK are especially vulnerable – both Cole and Morris argue that there are clues here as to how things might operate differently. “‘Normal’ was unsustainable,” Cole argues. “The endless expansion, the mega-collectors, the purchasing of big trophy objects. I think we’re entering a period of less is more. I hope it’ll be less macho.”Morris suggests that footfall-driving blockbuster exhibitions, with star loans shipped carbon-intensively from Berlin to LA to Tokyo, might have had their day. “It’d be great for museums to focus on their permanent collections, the amazing things we already possess. We’ve taken our eye off the core mission. I’d love a return to slower looking.”Everyone agrees that, whatever comes next, galleries will have a bigger role than ever. The moment they reopen, it’s hard not to see them being thronged, says Zwirner: “The work of art in a physical space is different: it craves you. Looking at art is a communal act.”The big question, of course, is what we’ll be looking at: with an event as all-enveloping as the current pandemic, is it too early to speak of “corona art”?The contemporary artist Ryan Gander has talked of the “time famine” afflicting the art world artists – like many of us – now have plenty of time on their hands. And whether they’re sequestered in their studios or trying to balance childcare and laundry, many will end up channelling their experiences of this strangest of moments into the work they make. Judging by Gander’s Zoom studio tours and Martin Creed’s livestream jam sessions, some already are.Morris isn’t sure what will result, but feels confident that it will be worth attending to: “If you look at the great traumatising events of the past – world wars, global emergencies of different kinds – artists have always responded,” she says. “After the first world war it was dada and surrealism after the second, existentialism and gestural abstraction. Whatever the work looks like, it’ll be interesting.”Keen to get an artist’s perspective, I track down the Argentinian-born, New York-based Mika Rottenberg, best known for her unsettling installations and videos, some of which take aim – appropriately enough – at the excesses of late capitalism. When we Skype, she’s in upstate New York, trying to balance home-schooling her daughter and connecting with colleagues and friends, many of whose projects have been cancelled or postponed.Nonetheless, Rottenberg seems – if not exactly upbeat – at least philosophical. As an active member of the Culture Declares climate movement, she sees a strong connection between the climate emergency and the coronavirus one, and she is thinking hard about how art fits in – both as a response and something that can illuminate a path forward. More practically, she is using tools such as video conferencing to collaborate with other artists and scope out projects. She can’t be physically present in a gallery, but perhaps she doesn’t need to be.“The fear is that we become more conservative, build a wall around ourselves,” Rottenberg says. “I really don’t want that to happen. And even if we can’t travel, I don’t want us to abandon that sense of global connectedness, the exchange of ideas. Right now we need hospital beds and ventilators and masks, but art has a role to play too. It has to.”Has she actually been able to get any work done? She laughs. “I’m used to multi-tasking. When I’m not editing video, my favourite spot in the studio is the kitchen table.”Coronavirus has shown how many of us, when trapped at home, have reached instinctively for art. Maybe it’s taking a virtual spin around the Sistine Chapel, or dusting off craft materials. Maybe it’s sketching ferrets. “People are really having to make do with what they have,” says Cole. “They’re sharing images, video, memes, using art in all sorts of creative ways.” She ponders the question. “Art is really useful at the moment. Whatever comes next, we have to cling to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267412f8a6f8d5c2c6f071318f5a0e39bc732b4d/0_176_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4434f22d541a587b4afabd8abf2d89e","title":"carol ann duffy leads british poets coronavirus imtiaz dharker jackie kay","story":"Major names including Imtiaz Dharker, Jackie Kay and father-and-son poets Ian and Andrew McMillan to document outbreak in verse Carol Ann Duffy has launched an international poetry project with major names including Imtiaz Dharker, Roger McGough and Ian McMillan, as a response to the coronavirus pandemic.The former poet laureate hopes the project, entitled Write Where We Are Now, “will provide an opportunity for reflection and inspiration in these challenging times, as well as creating a living record of what is happening as seen through our poets’ eyes and ears, in their gardens or garrets”.Hands, Duffy’s poem, was written on 26 March and sees the author reflecting on how every Thursday, “we clap at the darkness”, and on how she can see the hands of her absent daughter “when I put my head in my own”. Another contribution from the Scottish poet takes a fiercer tone: Since You Ask sees her “Scunnered, stymied, shafted, shaded,  shat on from a great height, spaffed, spooked.” It ends: “OK, OK, OK. Onwards.”We clap at the darkness.I hearken for the soundof my daughter’s small hands,but she is miles away...though I can see her handswhen I put my head in my own.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn Andrew McMillan’s Garden, he writes of how at first the dead “were few  enough to name them  but soon they grew too many  the vast fields of them”.Duffy is spearheading the project with the Manchester Writing School at Manchester politan University. Contributors range from new and emerging poets to award-winners Raymond Antrobus and Andrew McMillan, and some of British poetry’s biggest names, such as Gillian Clarke and Jackie Kay.“We need the voice of poetry in times of change and world-grief. A poem only seeks to add to the world and now seems the time to give,” said Duffy, who is creative director of the writing school.In Cranes Lean In, Dharker writes of a phone call with her daughter while she looks over a London in lockdown: “Petals brush my face.  You say at last  the cherry blossom  has arrived  as if that is what  we were really waiting for.”She wrote it, she said, “standing at a window looking out over the marooned city. London had stopped its eternal building and the streets and stations were becalmed.”“That was the day it suddenly came home to many mothers what this meant, this strange waiting time without their children,” Dharker went on. “I could hear the phone calls all over the world, people separated and searching for words of hope and consolation to give each other. The words my daughter gave me were about kindnesses, and something we had both been waiting for: the cherry trees blossoming in the parks and streets of London.”Cranes lean in, waiting for an all-clearthat will not come.\u0026nbspForehead pressed to glass,phone at my ear, I learnto sail on your voiceover a sadness of building sites,\u0026nbsppast King’s Cross, St Pancras,to the place where you are.You say nothingis too far, motherswill find their daughters,strangers will be neighbours,even saviourswill have names.You are all flamein a red dress.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPetals brush my face.You say at lastas if that is whatwe were really waiting for.McMillan, winner of the 2015  first book award and a contributor alongside his father, Ian, said it was “really important to record as a continuing historical document the times we’re living through”.“I’ve always believed a poet’s job is to be a witness, and this is just another example of that,” said McMillan, who said he had found it very hard to write his poem.“There are some things which feel beyond language – huge numbers of deaths, untold suffering, unmanageable fear. We’re dealing with abstracts and the first instinct within that is to reach for abstracts ourselves, but abstracts don’t make for good poetry,” he said. “All I tried to do, and all I think any of us can do, is focus on something small and contained and concrete, and try to tell it that way.”In Unbecoming Maramot, Romalyn Ante, an award-winning poet who works as an NHS nurse, writes after a shift: “She walks an unlit road on her own, yet not alone.  Look at her now – night after night, shift after shift.” TS Eliot-winning poet George Szirtes is writing a new poem every day for the project, while Moira Egan and David Tait are writing from lockdown in Italy and China respectively.Prof Malcolm Press, vice-chancellor of Manchester politan University, called the initiative inspiring. “I am sure that these outstanding poems will voice the sentiments and feelings that many of us around the world will share,” he said. “At the same time, I am confident that these innovative and imaginative works will inspire creativity and hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/010ee661e7492c2eef19886e8b8d80aa5acf8a40/0_163_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e1098349cb5dffb4ee34843e618eb88","title":"supermarket staff workers tell us coronavirus affected your work","story":"Are you under extra pressure?

This reading was taken in the first week of April, so there could well be more pain to come. Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said:The UK Household Finance Index is already showing wide-reaching financial consequences of the lockdown measures implemented in late March.Around one-in-three UK households reported a decline in income from employment during April, which was by far the largest number since the survey began in 2009.But Hayes is still seeing the slimmest of silver linings:Nevertheless, we can still draw a small degree of positivity from the latest results, with overall measures of cash available to spend and household debt proving much more stable than workplace incomes. There was a slight pick-up in unsecured lending needs, while in some cases savings were depleted to meet immediate financing needs.Limiting the adverse impact on UK household balance sheets will be crucial in the coming months so that when economic activity does recover, consumers are not stuck repaying debts and instead are able to boost discretionary spending to aid a strong recovery. British household finances have reached their weakest point since November 2011, according to an index broadly followed by economists. IHS Markit’s UK household finance index, which measures households’ overall perceptions of financial wellbeing, plummeted to a reading of 34.9 in April, with the biggest monthly drop since the survey was started in 2009, as the financial crisis raged.At this point economic indicators are expressing the extent of rather than the fact of recession, but it is still a stark picture. And the signs for the future are not positive either. From IHS Markit’s release: With a large degree of uncertainty surrounding the time frame to which the emergency public health measures will be maintained, financial wellbeing expectations also fell sharply. Overall, the respective index signalled the strongest level of pessimism for almost eight-and-a-half years. There were almost 70,000 applications for the state wage support in the first half hour of the portal being open, according to the head of HM Revenue and Customs.This is from the Financial Times (£) write-up of HMRC Jim Harra’s appearance on BBC radio earlier:Harra said that the website was working, with about 67,000 claims from employers before 8.30am. He said: “We have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims. There are over 2m PAYE schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those.”The system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, the Treasury said.HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs has deployed 9,500 staff to deal with queries, including 5,000 on web chat, but there are fears that the website could crash and that telephone lines could also be overwhelmed.You can read the full report here:There are some worrying moves on bond markets, with Italian government debt pricing in more risk ahead of an EU summit this week where coronabonds will be on the agenda.An increasing spread between the two bond yields is one of the most important indicators of how investors view the risks to the Italian economy. If there is no solidarity across the eurozone that could spell trouble.Selling pressure on Italian government bonds has returned in the past week, undoing some of the benefits of the European Central Bank’s massive bond-buying scheme, after eurozone politicians failed to agree to common debt issuance as a means of addressing the crisis.Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte used an interview with Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday to repeat calls for the EU to issue common eurozone bonds to demonstrate the bloc’s solidarity in the face of a pandemic that is likely to trigger the worst recession in years. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid said:Thursday is the key day this week with the EU leaders summit a potentially big event for the future of Europe as they discuss how close the region can get to joint issuance in the near future.Expect creative ambiguity to rule as it normally does on the continent. Nevertheless you would expect more explicit details to be outlined as to how Europe will help Italy. Will this be enough to keep Italian spreads (and domestic politics) in check though? “Don’t panic,” suggest analysts led by Mark Haefele, chief investment officer in UBS’s wealth management arm. They forecast prices of WTI and Brent crude of $20 per barrel at the end of June, and over $40 per barrel at the end of the year.The volatile trade comes amid fears US storage facilities could soon max out, leaving markets watching both domestic production and inbound crude tankers due for US ports. If the current pace of the inventory build continues, we could see US tankshit max capacity roughly by the end of June.But the sharp swing in the front month contract also reflects thinned trade, with most of the market already shifting to the June contract before the Tuesday rollover.But oil prices could be the last of the major asset classes to recover from the coronavirus crisis, cautioned Stephen Innes, global markets strategist at foreign exchange trader Axicorp. Regardless of what OPEC does, there will be structural demand loss for oil due to less travel. At a minimum, oil prices will be the last asset class to recover from lockdown. End transport demand will only occur in the final stages of reopening when border crossing is allowed, and travel restrictions get lifted. People will then flock again to planes, trains, and automobile One possible explanation for the bumpy ride on the FTSE 100 this morning (it is now mildly negative): the prospect of the UK easing restrictions appears to be fairly distant.Culture secretary Oliver Dowden is doing the media rounds this morning. He confirmed that the government is reluctant to lift the lockdown for fear of sparking a second wave of infections, telling BBC Breakfast:The worst thing we could possibly do would be to prematurely ease the restrictions, and then find a second peak and have to go right back to square one again, potentially with even more draconian measures.You can follow more on the UK coronavirus live blog:The positive start to the week on European stock markets was very short-lived indeed: the major indices are now negative today.Billionaire investor Lawrence Stroll, who led the bailout, also takes over as executive chairman of Aston Martin’s board today.

Spreadbetting companies have seen a remarkable boom during quarantine measures, as historic market volatility coupled with the fact of millions of people being locked inside have contributed to an enormous surge in revenues. Asaf Elimelech, Plus 500’s chief executive, “tendered his resignation from the board and the company with immediate effect”, the company said in a statement to the stock market. However, he has a year’s notice period so will work alongside his successor to hand over.Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.The US oil price benchmark has hit its lowest level since March 1999, with investors seeing little in the way of demand growth while coronavirus lockdowns continue in the world’s largest economies.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures prices for May delivery fell as low as $14.47 per barrel in early trading, below the levels seen even during the Iraq war. The price fall also partly reflects the way the futures market functions, with the expiration on Tuesday of the contract for May delivery meaning some traders’ demand moves to the next month. Even historic production cuts from Opec+ - the cartel of oil producers including Saudi Arabia, plus Russia - have failed to prop up prices. Oil tankers generally used for transport have instead been drafted in for storage by traders hoping for higher prices. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda, said: With above-ground storage bulging at the seams, WTI’s only hope, it appears, is for production cut action from the impending decisions of state authorities in Texas and Oklahoma, and lots of producers going out of business. In other developments this morning, China continued its incremental economics stimulus efforts with an interest rate cut. From the Reuters report:China cut its benchmark lending rate as expected on Monday to reduce borrowing costs for companies and prop up the coronavirus-hit economy, after it contracted for the first time in decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db4b50ab98663b552705684edec6fa067f25b712/0_85_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03070d57f0a452a849ffc7d004d4334f","title":"bame dying coronavirus sadiq khan","story":"The government must collect the data and publish it, so that this injustice can be addressedAs the death toll sadly continues to climb, it’s clear Covid-19 spares no one. Young, old, rich, poor, northerner, southerner – everyone is at risk of catching, spreading and potentially succumbing to the coronavirus.However, this doesn’t mean the impact of this crisis is being felt equally. More and more, the notion that this epidemic is some kind of “great leveller” is being exposed for what it is – a complete myth.But one of the biggest underlying factors driving the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities is socioeconomic. It’s an uncomfortable truth that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented in poor, overcrowded accommodation, or households with multiple generations under one roof. And it’s a fact that they are more likely to live in poverty or work in precarious and low-paid jobs. Many simply don’t have the luxury of being able to work safely from home during the lockdown. All of this contributes to a BAME population with worse health than average, lower life expectancy and a greater prevalence of serious underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes.With what we already know about Covid-19 and how it attacks those with underlying health conditions, it’s hardly a surprise that those from ethnic-minority backgrounds may be more likely to catch it and, it seems, die.It’s by no means a revelation that there’s a link between health and socioeconomic inequalities – certainly not for those who live these lives, or for all the charities, campaigners and organisations, including City Hall, that have been fighting these injustices for years. But one of the unexpected consequences of this crisis is that the depth of these inequalities is being laid bare in such a stark fashion.Of course I welcome the government’s announcement last week to launch a review into why people from BAME backgrounds are being disproportionately affected by Covid-19. But I fear we already know the conclusions of the review, and what action is needed.What would be particularly useful right now is a commitment to routinely collect and publish data on the demographics of everyone impacted by the coronavirus so that we can understand and act on these concerns. At the moment, we know the age and sex of everyone who contracts and tragically dies from the coronavirus, but we still have little additional reliable information, including about their ethnicity. If the information was collected and published in real time, it would help bring the true scale of the problem to light and provide more evidence about how to protect communities from the virus. Promises to provide this data in the future is not good enough – we need it to be collected and published right now. There simply is no good reason to wait.There will inevitably be those who say that this has nothing to do with someone’s ethnicity. Even though it can be uncomfortable for some to acknowledge, we cannot ignore the barriers of discrimination and structural racism that exist in our society, which contribute to ethnic minorities being more likely to suffer from poverty, have underlying health conditions and work in insecure, low-paid jobs.So this must be a wake-up call for our country and a catalyst for far-reaching and fundamental change. I’m a proud Londoner who often talks about how nowhere else in the world could someone from my background – the son of a bus driver, the child of immigrants and someone of Muslim faith – reach the position I have. But I want us to be even better and to live up to our British values of fairness, equality and justice for all.That’s why, once this crisis is over, we will need to forge a new social contract that advances the twin causes of racial and economic equality, and prioritises the welfare and wellbeing of every single community in this country.Ultimately, this would be the most fitting tribute we could pay to all the courageous people who have lost their lives on the frontline of this battle. And it would be the only way we can create a country where never again will someone’s race, background or socialeconomic status determine the difference between life and death.• Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83f9917f6daf94932e53dc01afcb7639f7b8b2f5/0_182_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f759e4a1e42c7dec68ace24042e5848","title":"live music silenced performers covid 19","story":"Deprived of income from live concerts by Covid-19, musicians and venues are in a fight for survival. Thankfully, fans can helpFor the last few weeks a nightly musical ritual has taken hold of a small but growing corner of Twitter. Thanks to Tim Burgess, singer with the longstanding British group the Charlatans, each evening at an appointed time, anyone who fancies participating puts on a particular album – and, as it plays, posts their thoughts with the hashtag #timstwitterlisteningparty. Better still, musicians who made the tracks often join in, adding their insights and recollections.I have taken part in two events far – for the Flaming Lips’ 1999 masterpiece The Soft Bulletin and Our Favourite Shop, the Style Council’s evocation of Britain in the Thatcher years, released in 1985. Music of any kind is usually life-affirming: talking and thinking about it often has the same effect. This is a big part of how many of us are getting through the crisis. Moreover, as the grim effects of the outbreak become clearer by the day, what we are listening to offers a comforting reminder of the world we suddenly left behind mere weeks ago.At the same time, however, music and its surrounding culture are being weakened. Obviously, public performances of any kind have all been cancelled, and the hiatus could conceivably last well into next year. Festival season seems to be a write-off. And in the fine details of research about how the virus spreads, there are actually suggestions that the participatory aspects of music have been in part responsible for Covid-19’s transmission: witness a senior German virologist’s claim that over the last weeks and months, “wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly”.As with the rest of the economy, over about the last 20 years the business of music has seen a polarisation between a handful of huge entities at the top – your Ed Sheerans, Taylor Swifts and Beyoncés – and everyone else. For the latter group, all the main sources of substantial income are suddenly either shut down or under threat. The temporary halt to playing live removes the one dependable way musicians can make money. Royalties from music being played in pubs, clubs and shops are suddenly in jeopardy, and with advertising revenues down, the fees paid to music publishers by broadcasters may be cut. Given the long-term decline of physical sales, that only leaves streaming – at which point, let us remind ourselves that YouTube’s average per-stream rate has been put at a princely 0.13p, and that Spotify is reckoned to pay artists an average of 0.26p per listen.Last week I spoke to a musician I have extensively written about for music magazines and watched play to a festival crowd of 4,000. As he explained, the realities of being in a critically acclaimed band that is run – very tightly – as a small business, many things became even clearer. “I don’t think there are many bands who make a significant income from their recorded music,” he said. Instead, an annual or biannual run around venues here and abroad will bring in up to two-thirds of an act’s turnover, and the summer is often the basis of whole livelihoods: the cancellation of festivals, he said, had spelled the disappearance of “all the money we’d be expecting to make this year”. Payments from Spotify arrive every six months: the band has some songs that have amassed close to a million plays each, but their last payment was for about £600.According to the campaigning organisation the Music Venues Trust, 556 places classed as “grassroots music venues” are reckoned to be at risk of permanent closure. Late last year, it looked like this vital part of the cultural map had finally got the attention of the government and music industry, and arrested a 10-year decline partly linked to urban gentrification and skyrocketing rents. Now, once again, venues face disaster.In the classical music world, things are just as uncertain. Outside Britain’s big “portfolio” orchestras, most musicians are precariously employed. One conductor I recently spoke to drew my attention to an awkward fact: that audiences for classical music tend to be older, and will therefore be anxious about any return to past concert-going habits. He also mentioned his work with a choir in Yorkshire that has lost two of its members to Covid-19, and how important collective singing is to so many people’s lives. That simple pleasure, he reminded me, is suddenly reducible to “people in a room where everyone’s breath is repeatedly coming out”.Of course, to write about this in the midst of an international emergency might seem misplaced. But beyond the superstars, a lot of musicians are actually more vulnerable than people in other professions. To help them, you can buy the odd CD and record from an independent shop by mail order. Have a look at Bandcamp, the platform for independent musicians that supports them to a much greater extent than the services hosted by corporate record companies and big tech firms. The Musicians’ Union is hosting a crowdfunder for members facing hardship, offering emergency payments of up to £200. But all of us should also think about the wider context of this cultural crisis. Amazon’s share price has recently rocketed by a third. Netflix, all of whose offerings feature an ocean of music, is in the middle of a boom. Big tech, which has built so much of its power on downloading and streaming, will emerge from this period comparatively unscathed. Somewhere in those facts there may lie the key to how we keep music and musicians going, and avoid a dreadful silence that would make this crisis even harder to bear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09539bc6797c656bc56f7aea727145fad1dc879/0_51_4555_2733/master/4555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3efaf930fb652b327dd431ec2138ce7","title":"coronavirus master of disguise scientists viruses covid 19","story":"A host of factors determines whether a virus survives and thrives in humans. Sars-Cov-2 struck it luckyEd Newman walked to the podium with the calm confidence of a soldier and welcomed us with humility. His audience was 20 virology researchers preparing to lead groups in universities around the UK in 2016.Newman, then a Porton Down-based virologist for Public Health England, had seen more action than all of us combined. He shared photos of his travels in African villages ravaged by some of the most dangerous viruses that face humanity. Pop-up labs set up in tents, with “clean” areas on one side for DNA sequencing equipment to confirm virus infection, and patient areas to the other side, hosting beds with seriously ill people. Fascinating, how a tiny piece of genetic information wrapped in a protein coat can cause such devastation.Let’s face it, viruses that cause “the sniffles” aren’t what get most of us into virology. Some colleagues quote zombie apocalypse movies as inspiration for entering the field, and it’s true that there’s a certain macabre thrill in studying these terrible pathogens. But there are really only a few viruses able to kill us within days of infection.What is it that makes a virus deadly, or merely an inconvenience? What determines whether it spreads to become a pandemic, like Sars-Cov-2, or burns out rapidly, in a remote location? What does “success” mean, in viral terms? These are questions on many peoples’ minds, as they wonder what else might be out there. Could the next pandemic be 50 times as bad as this one? Is the lethality of viruses a grim lottery, with mere luck separating us from something like Ebola sweeping the Earth?In fact, viruses generally have to follow certain rules if they want to get ahead. Stealth is critical, because these pathogens are unable to thrive and reproduce alone. Instead, they invade host cells and rely on them to, first, decode their genetic information to produce components for new virus particles, next, assemble those components, and finally, release new viruses to infect more cells. If this process causes tissue damage that leads to organ failure, the virus risks perishing along with its host.A successful spy must be a master of disguise, and so it is with viruses: if they want to evade recognition by immune cells, they must change their protein coat frequently. This is achieved via tiny alterations in their genetic material called mutations. The Goldilocks principle applies here: if the mutations are too subtle, the viral coat will be easily identified by existing antibodies, whereas if they are too drastic they might simply inactivate the virus. The mutations that allow viruses to fly under the radar fall somewhere in between. Influenza viruses, which use rapidly evolving ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material, are experts at this game.History teaches us that influenza mutations can result in pandemics with millions of deaths, so we’ve learned to keep a watchful eye on them. As flu evolves over the months, virologists respond by producing seasonal vaccines that remain effective – for a time, at least.Coronaviruses have RNA genomes too, but they are very large. That means that there are many more opportunities for mutations to go wrong – from the virus’s point of view. As a result, they have developed a sort of “proof-reading” mechanism that edits out mutations – meaning that they change a lot less rapidly than flu does. This is good news for us, and for vaccine development. But we still need more information to determine just how long a vaccine might be effective for.How does a virus go on to achieve world domination? Getting from A to B is of the essence. Sars-Cov-2 rides droplets propelled by coughs and sneezes to board a new host. This is a more effective route of transmission than that used by non-respiratory viruses like Ebola, and its efficiency is increased if the virus particles are more stable and can survive on surfaces outside the body. This is why keeping a safe distance from each other and isolating patients is so useful in preventing new infections. Sars-Cov-2 also has a lipid-containing coat, so thorough handwashing with soap, which breaks down fats, can stop it in its tracks.It should be increasingly clear that to end the pandemic and keep Covid-19 outbreaks to a minimum, we need to seriously upgrade our spyware. We need surveillance teams of epidemiologists that decipher patterns of viral spread and molecular virologists to track virus evolution so we can update our defences. We need immunologists to help to understand how the body fights the virus and aid vaccine research. We also need trained and well-equipped doctors and nurses to safely look after infected people, and scientists to help design effective treatments.We need to fund these heroes well, and keep their kit up to date, and we need structures and public health strategies in place to promote hygiene, contain outbreaks and prevent transmission. Covid-19 has shown us that we must stay vigilant, and each of us can personally help break the transmission cycle.What if a new pathogen emerges and bears all those terrifying hallmarks of viral success – it doesn’t kill us quickly, mutates often, and is easily transmitted? We rely on the World Health Organization to report new outbreaks and international teams of experts to act rapidly to contain them. It’s important that both receive proper funding and support from governments. When someone like Newman, or the UK’s Public Health Rapid Support Team, receives a call to pick up their pop-up lab and join other defenders at the heart of the outbreak, not everyone welcomes them on location, and people are understandably reluctant to keep away from their infected loved ones. These teams will have their work cut out for them. But their work is vital. And when they return they will doubtless have lots of stories to share with the new generation of virologists – some of them, hopefully, inspired to join the fight by the crisis we’re now battling.• Dr Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/956f2ec6f82fd34a7a614087ea131d30e4aa61f9/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ddf8c88eb635b4bc3dbea867a6f2b141 1290w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dinner","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dinner’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dinner’.Share your photos of what dinner means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 22 April at 10am.

Instead, teachers will score and rank their pupils in each subject, based on mock exam results, coursework, marks in assignments and any other evidence. The grades that they issue to exam boards by the end of May are what they believe candidates would have achieved in public examinations if the school year had operated as normal.Ofqual, the exam regulator, has instructed schools not to share those grades or discuss them with families. Despite that, parents are contacting teachers to lobby for their children. Some are offering mitigating circumstances for disappointing mock results, for instance, or insisting that as their child has a private tutor, they would have done better than expected in exams.Tom Middlehurst, the director of policy and public affairs at SSAT, a school network with 3,000 members, many of them academies, said: “The difficulty is that the kind of parents who are having those discussions and making that effort are likely to be middle-class parents and what we must really not allow to happen this summer is that educational inequality widens. Already with home schooling and school closures there is likely to be a long-term impact on the more disadvantaged and we have to mitigate this where we can. Of course parents want to be reassured by what is going on but they must allow teachers to use their professional judgments to make those decisions.”The Alsager School in Cheshire, in response to students badgering staff about grades, has told parents and pupils that “there is nothing that iniduals can do that will influence their final grades” and that GCSE and A-level pupils will no longer be set work by their subject teachers.Ormiston Forge Academy in the West Midlands has also asked pupils to “please refrain from contacting teachers about suggested awarded grades”.Elsewhere, teachers are receiving a sudden rush of extra work from pupils who fear they have underperformed in class, in the hope of an 11th hour reprieve. One member of staff at a high-performing sixth form college said he had never received so many emails from parents thanking him for teaching their child.Teachers face a difficult and novel challenge in putting classmates in rank order. The number of candidates for GCSE maths and English in particular, is substantial, with hundreds of pupils bunching around grades 4 and 5.Even then, the grades schools submit to exam boards are likely to change when the final results are published in August. A standardisation process will apply statistical adjustments to teacher-assessed grades, using data about each school’s performance in previous years and the cohort’s prior achievement in key stage 2 tests or GCSEs.Ofqual has said that it plans to put “more weight on statistical expectations” to even out teacher grading that is too severe or too generous.But some headteachers are concerned that if too much weight is given to schools’ previous results, it may disadvantage pupils in secondaries that are on an upward trajectory.Middlehurst said: “While we understand the need for using schools’ prior attainment, we are concerned that this will unfairly disadvantage the students at schools that have made concerted efforts to improve in the last 12 months. Many SSAT members have been in touch to say that they are honestly predicting significantly better results in 2020 than in previous years. This is not about league tables as they will not be published this year it is about the inidual pupil getting a fair result.”Concerns have also been raised about whether high achieving pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds will receive the grades they deserve. Research shows that these students are generally predicted lower grades by their teachers on Ucas forms than the ones they go on to achieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91563b8e3f4441bff411667b078e8b219edef27e/0_322_5159_3095/master/5159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01577ce060389dadbe3b48e6b1dbbb39","title":"parents share your experiences of home schooling coronavirus","story":"As schools start in the UK we want to hear from parents about your experiences of children working from home due to coronavirusPupils at schools in the UK will be expected to stay at home for at least three weeks as the government extended the lockdown.We want to hear from parents on their experiences of having their children for home schooling.What has your experience been like?

A launch date that pays homage to the planet rather than the artificial seasons of fashion, and dovetails with the concept of timeless, seasonless clothes designed for wardrobe longevity.The date was decided on six months ago, and arrives carrying a rather different significance. During an unprecedented shutdown which has seen consumer demand crushed, and with all 50 John Lewis department stores currently closed, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners + Mother of Pearl will go on sale online only.It is a strange moment to be selling clothes, concedes the Mother of Pearl designer Amy Powney. “When you strip everything back to basics, you question what you need and what you don’t. This time at home has made everything feel more sacred. Every purchase, every walk, every conversation with friends and family.”Earth Day has been growing in profile as a key date in the fashion calendar. The sustainable sneaker brand Allbirds, which marked Earth Day 2019 by donating proceeds from the sales of limited edition shoes to the protection of birds endangered by climate change, are marking this year’s date by becoming the first brand to label their products with a carbon footprint counter, along the lines of calorie information printed on processed food. The brand’s bestselling Wool Runners come with a carbon “price tag” of 7.2kg. For comparison, a pair of jeans averages 29.6kg, and a plastic shopping bag 1.6kg.Powney believes that the most practical way to tackle the problem of fast fashion is to offer consumers a desirable alternative, and sees lockdown as an opportunity to steer consumers in a new direction. “Fashion most certainly isn’t a top priority right now. But seeing the world’s carbon emissions start to drop as the world comes to a standstill is a clear signal that if we collectively change our habits and everyday actions, we can make better decisions to help our planet heal.”Featuring breezy polka dot dresses, striped shirting and an elegant caramel-toned trouser suit with her label’s trademark outsize pearl buttons, this collection is an opportunity for Powney to take her “mission” for sustainable, ethical, traceable fashion to a wider audience without compromising her principles.“I really appreciate that John Lewis don’t sell trend-led, fashion-crazed collections,” she says. Prices start at £59. “In my opinion, some of the prices you see on the high street elsewhere are so low that you don’t need to know about supply chains to work out that someone has lost out in the making of them,” she adds.The collection’s ethical credentials are centred on sustainable fabrics, with all pieces produced either in Tencel or organic cotton, both of which are biodegradable. Tencel wood-pulp fibres are derived from sustainably managed sources, processed into fibre by the sustainable textile manufacturers Lenzing via a closed-loop system designed to minimise water and energy usage. Virtual sampling, in which garments are trialled on digital avatars without any fabric being cut, has been used to cut down waste and minimise the carbon footprint of transportation.“We completely understand that today is a very different moment to the day we began this collection,” says Jo Bennett, the head of buying for John Lewis, of the lockdown launch. “But we are still looking for some escapism, and moments of joy.”A plan to mark the launch with a pop-up buy-back scheme at John Lewis’s London flagship was mothballed by store closures, but the sustainability drive continues online, with personal stylists offering video appointments to advise on wardrobe clearouts, “to help customers rediscover treasured items and build outfits”.While store closures and the stay-at-home orders have hit clothing sales hard, Bennett says online sales of coloured and patterned tops – ideal for smart video conference calls – have bucked the trend. But Powney, currently juggling caring for her three-month-old daughter Niamh with the stress of keeping a small fashion business afloat, admits she has let her aesthetic standards slip. She describes her working from home wardrobe as “a total disaster … leggings and my husband’s T-shirts, mostly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d13743e4a213d09ab54992f5cdc92267dd1ad97d/7_229_2901_1741/master/2901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb6dd4515dbab0c1c46f587d4942c884","title":"elliott gould mash the long goodbye friends streisand elvis","story":"The star of M*A*S*H, The Long Goodbye – and more recently, Friends – talks about drugs, his fiery marriage to Barbra Streisand and getting his best reviews from Groucho Marx and Muhammad AliThe best review ever received by Elliott Gould – renowned actor and star of M*A*S*H and The Long Goodbye not to mention, Ross and Monica’s dad on Friends – was from Groucho Marx. The two of them had become close in the comedian’s latter years – so close, Gould says, “he used to let me shave him”. One day Marx asked Gould to change a lightbulb in his bedroom. Gould took off his shoes, stood on the bed and replaced the broken bulb. Marx told him: “That was the best acting I’ve ever seen you do.”Gould, now 81, has been telling the story for decades – but it is clear even in our pixelated video call that it still delights him. “Isn’t that great?” he says, his distinctive nasal, New York baritone now deepened with age. As we speak he is sitting at a computer at a friend’s house in Los Angeles, relaxed in a blue hoodie, with a seemingly bottomless mug of coffee before him. In isolation on either side of the Atlantic, neither of us has anywhere to be. And after more than half a century in Hollywood, in which he went from leading man to exile and, eventually, fixture – Gould could fill days, not just hours, with his stories. Even without his eight-year marriage to Barbra Streisand.In a prolific list of credits, Gould has no single iconic role. You might choose M*A*S*H, Bob \u0026amp Carol \u0026amp Ted \u0026amp Alice or The Long Goodbye, but there are also Little Murders (“close to a perfect picture,” says Gould), Capricorn One, American History X, the Ocean’s 11 franchise – or Friends. (The week before our interview, Gould was due to reprise the role of Jack Gellar in Friends for HBO Max’s long-awaited reunion special, but the pandemic delayed production.)Many have seen Gould more recently in Contagion, Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 medical thriller that has had a coronavirus-inspired resurgence. Gould plays an epidemiologist based on the real-life expert Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University, who consulted on the film. The pair remain friendly and Gould says Lipkin gave him advice on his plans to travel to Seattle and Italy: don’t go. (The scientist was diagnosed with the virus shortly afterwards.)So Gould is “sequestering” in his friend’s house and happy to tell the story of his life, even if by way of many freewheeling ergences, from Netflix recommendations to gnomic theories on human nature. Gould admits his thinking is “not always linear”. Some memories take time to retrieve: “I flush it out as we’re talking.” But once they emerge, they are precise, both in detail and dialogue, such as his “little date” with Elvis.Back in the 70s, Gould asked to meet Presley in his Las Vegas dressing room. They were at close quarters, Gould recalls, made all the more so by the conspicuous, gilded .45 automatic in Elvis’s belt and the watchful presence of his manager, Tom “The Colonel” Parker, as well as the singer’s father, Vernon. It was clear to Gould that they would not let their “cash cow” out of their sight and he said so, urging Presley to “leave ‘Elvis’ here and come out, be a free spirit”. “Elvis says to me, with his gold gun in his belt: ‘You’re crazy, man.’ I said: ‘Elvis, I ain’t crazy. I’m scared, just like you.’”Gould was born Elliott Goldstein in Brooklyn in 1938, the only child of Bernard and Lucille – non-orthodox, working-class Jews. Their marriage was troubled (they eventually orced after 27 years), but they were ambitious for their son, putting him through stage school.He was a shy, fearful child, who loved to get lost in radio dramas, Sherlock Holmes stories and Pinocchio, but struggled to express himself. His parents worried that he was slow to develop. One of his earliest memories is being told, when he was two: “You don’t know how to feel, and you don’t know how to think, and we’ll tell you.”“I didn’t know that there was a difference between thinking and feeling,” he says. “Now I realise, because I’ve been able to understand myself, and having been afraid for so long – I didn’t want them to think I was stupid.” Yet he also credits them with his success: “My mother never gave up – I have no choice, I have to be this way.”As a young boy he did not enjoy performing, but it brought him out of his shell. “I thought that if I memorised routines, perhaps I could be able to communicate.” His tap dance teacher made a particular impression on the 12-year-old Gould. “He just pounded me mentally. When I wept, he did not treat me like a baby and he got through to me.” Later, the teacher gave him a copy of Webster’s dictionary, to which he still routinely refers.In 1957, aged 19, Gould made his Broadway debut in the musical Rumple, at the Alvin theatre. “It smelled great,” Gould remembers, inhaling the memory. “I could go to the theatre and feel I have some place where I belong.” A few small parts followed. Then, in 1961, he was cast as the leading man in the musical I Can Get It For You Wholesale, “which was so unlikely!” he says, with feeling. He sat in on the final audition of the “brilliant” Barbra Streisand. Gould says he saw elements of himself in her, that same inhibition from childhood: “She presents herself the way I feel about myself.”I interject: did he fancy her? Gould goes quiet and I wonder if our video connection has cut out. Then he says: “She’s so beautiful, are you kidding?” After her audition, Streisand gave him her phone number aloud Gould memorised it, and called her. Streisand invited him to see her sing but he declined. “I said: ‘You’re so good, I think you’re going to be in the show – we’ll see if we get to know one another then.’”Streisand was cast as Gould’s character’s secretary, Miss Marmelstein the part was enlarged to do her justice. Shortly after the play closed in early 1963, after a stellar run of 300 performances, the pair married. A year later Streisand was the toast of the business in Funny Girl, with an album at No 1. Gould has likened their marriage to both a souffle and a “bath of lava”. Streisand has been working on a book for some time, says Gould, and will often call him to draw on his recollections. “And I don’t spin. It’s so precious to me, that it has to be absolutely right.”Gould’s picture of their marriage has Streisand putting her career above their family life and him rebelling against the limits of it. They orced in 1971, five years after the birth of their son Jason and following a two-year separation. Streisand later called Gould to ask why they had grown apart. He told her: “We didn’t grow together, and you made yourself more important than us, and all I care about is us. We made it very fast, and no one has what we have.” But, today Gould says: “I couldn’t play the part. I had to be able to find myself, to be able to be myself. I couldn’t let myself live in a mould.”In 1969, Gould starred in Paul Mazursky’s wife-swap comedy Bob \u0026amp Carol \u0026amp Ted \u0026amp Alice. His performance secured him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. A string of hits followed: Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H, in which Gould cast himself as Trapper John McIntyre, and the student protest film Getting Straight. It was around this time that he got his second-best review – from Muhammad Ali, who told him: “You do what you do as well as I do what I do.”In 1970, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as “the star for an uptight age” for his (as he explains it now) “unexpected success” at a time of political upheaval. Later I ask him if the current US administration causes him some distress. “Some distress? Oh my goodness,” he replies, pulling his hands down over his eyes theatrically. “It’s not just that and it’s not just him.”He struggles to simplify his views: “I can’t even get an acceptable definition in my Webster’s dictionary.” But as a unionist, an idealist and a devout Jew, he believes “it’s all of us together, or none of us”. He says he intends to study politics more, though he seems to avoid talking about it where possible. Shooting the 2013 television drama Ray Donovan with Jon Voight, a Trump supporter, Gould told him: “No politics, Jon.” (When they work together “it can be like Laurel and Hardy on acid,” he adds.) He recalls a similarly loaded phone conversation with Jack Nicholson, who said to him: “I love being American, Ell.” Gould agreed, making reference to Canada and Mexico. Nicholson shouted back: “No, no, no! Just America!”“I thought: ‘Gee, that’s rather Trumpish, isn’t it?’ Diversity is essential to me. It’s essential to all of us.”In 1971, Gould was still cresting the wave and had just returned from Sweden, where he shot The Touch: the first English-language film for legendary director Ingmar Bergman. The director has largely dismissed the picture, but Gould was honoured to be chosen as his first non-Scandinavian leading man and sees working with the demanding director as a transformative moment. He recalls: “Bergman said to me, outside a 2,000-year-old church near Stockholm: ‘You’ve gone beyond your limits and you’ll have to live more to understand what you’ve done.’ “At that moment, I didn’t know limits.”He was a bankable star, with a tendency to push back against authority. “I can be very aggressive, or equally shy and repressed.” He was also at times a compulsive gambler. The 1974 drama California Split, said by some to be the best film about gambling ever made, was semi-autobiographical. Decades later, spending time in casinos for Ocean’s Eleven, Gould says he realised those days were behind him: “As much as I love to win, I hate losing more, and there’s nothing I need that I can win.”He has always denied ever having had a drug problem: on national television, in 1988 on the phone to Streisand (his response, in summary: “Bullshit”) and to me. “I had a reality problem,” is his oft-repeated quip. “Of course I smoked marijuana. I don’t do that now, because I’m centred and balanced and I don’t want to alter that.” As for “mind-expanding drugs” – mescaline, psilocybin, acid – Gould says: “I had some experience with that and did some work behind it.” He remembers telling Bergman (then in his 50s) about it. “He said it was interesting to him, but that he felt he did not want to do it at that time.” Was that experimentation part of his pushing back against directors? “No. No. No! But still, I saw too much – I knew too much.”After making The Touch, Gould says he “should have stayed out of work for a while”. Instead, in 1971, he took on A Glimpse of Tiger as co-producer and star. The film was never made (though it was later retooled as What’s Up, Doc?, starring Streisand), but its story is infamous. Just five days in, production was shut down, following reports of Gould’s erratic behaviour and power struggles. His co-star Kim Darby was so frightened of him that security was hired. Gould says now that he tried to reassure Darby that he was “really very sweet” and that she could ask for “time out” at any time – “but it couldn’t work that way”. Of his attempt to undermine the director, Anthony Harvey, he says. “We didn’t communicate and I behaved very badly.”Gould says he was “not sufficiently developed” to harness his newfound vision and naive about the demands of a production. “I wouldn’t compromise. I couldn’t. And I had to find out for myself, taking a chance, not knowing if I would ever get back. It’s pretty fabulous, to take the chance … and not be enslaved to one’s success,” he says. But the financial toll on Gould was significant and the fallout so disastrous that he was considered unfit to work for two years.In 1973, M*A*S*H director Altman threw Gould a lifeline, casting him as Philip Marlowe in his updating of The Long Goodbye. “Altman says: ‘You are this guy,’” says Gould, exhaling as though he still can’t believe his luck. The studio insisted that he take a psychiatric test, as well as the standard physical. Gould says Altman’s faith extended to allowing him to improvise a scene where Marlowe paints his face with inky fingerprints at a police station. “It exhibited the confidence and trust that Altman had in me, because it would have taken 25 minutes to clean me up.” The same year he married the actor Jenny Bogart. They went on to have two children – and two orces. “Jenny married me three times,” says Gould. Though they are no longer living together, he says he “will be married to Jenny for ever – until she can do better”.Gould’s likably loopy Marlowe trumps Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell for many – but to an entire generation he is Mr Geller from Friends. He almost didn’t take the part – “There wasn’t much in it for me” – but wound up doing 22 episodes in the show’s 236-episode run. He remembers it as a “very good experience” and feels fortunate to be part of its enduring success.Oddly, as Friends reruns onwards into the future, it may come to define a 50-year career that, Gould does not deny, has had highs and lows. Looking back, Gould says it would be “disloyal” to other crew members to regret any film he has worked on. “Sometimes things work, sometimes things don’t work, and we learn from it.” Even the 1978 Matilda, playing opposite a man in a cheap and unsettling kangaroo suit? He is tickled by the memory. “Oh, it wasn’t very good.” We have been talking for three hours even Gould is surprised that there is still coffee left in his mug. These days, he takes pleasure from nature, his children, his grandchildren and reflecting on life. He has been asked to direct but seems unhurried. Gould points to “career”, in his prized Webster’s dictionary, as having derived from a Spanish word meaning “obstacle course”.“I see it as a circle,” he says. “Sometimes, when people ask me: ‘How’s it going?’ I enjoy saying: ‘It’s going round.’ It always goes around.” He sounds like his favourite critic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ecce1b981acf7dea536dc368cd09102ace6d28/0_101_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97b5c7ef48e9116372fbbb905e09e12c","title":"ive never seen back to the future","story":"This 80s gem throws up some strange messages for a family film, but its mind-bending meta-mania is a joy to watch under lockdownIt’s a classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Back to the Future was released in 1985, four years before I was born, and my early film education consisted of Disney, then Harry Potter, and then any and every romantic comedy. It wasn’t until my final years at school and my decision to study French at university that my cinematic horizons expanded. Following my teacher’s encouragement, I watched Truffaut’s Jules et Jim and The 400 Blows, the Three Colours trilogy, Amélie and Delicatessen. I even branched out into Spanish (Y Tu Mamá También, Volver, Amores Perros) and a touch of German (The Lives of Others). Unless it was set in Hogwarts or Middle Earth, any type of adventure, sci-fi or fantasy film just didn’t appeal to me.But what better time to rectify that than during a nationwide lockdown? I think I’ll enjoy Back to the Future. After all, I know a few things about it already. I know that a young Michael J Fox gets involved in time travel with an eccentric scientist and things, as you’d imagine, start to go wrong. I’m aware that there’s also something about hoverboards, because every once in a while people complain that we were promised we’d have them by now. And I know that Fox’s character, Marty McFly, inspired the naming of a noughties pop band – but thankfully, I’ve never seen them, either.As it turns out, I do enjoy Back to the Future. I really, really enjoy it. I chuckle all the way through. I’m entertained, enraptured and squawk gleefully when that famous final line is delivered: “Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.” So that’s where that saying comes from, I shriek.For me, the joy of Back to the Future is the almost Shakespearean absurdity that forced my brain to keep up with the constant misunderstandings, to process the chicken-and-egg scenarios, and complete the many pop culture references that fail to land in 1950s Hill Valley. There’s also the untold repercussions to reckon with: what if Marty can’t deflect his mother’s advances on to his father, thus ensuring he has a future to go back to? The meta-mania is mind-bending.I loved Doc’s reaction to Ronald Reagan’s presidency, and thought that if I could travel back to 2003 and tell anyone that the host of the US Apprentice is now the leader of the free world, they’d likely respond in exactly the same way. I also adored the briefest of moments where, in the 1955 school canteen, Marty is finally able to relate to his father about the insecurities they both feel about their creativity – even if it’s not completely reciprocated.But there is one element of the film that doesn’t sit well – that Marty, essentially, is ashamed of his family his timid father, his alcoholic mother, lazy brother and whiny sister. Only by accidentally travelling into the past and altering the start of his parents’ relationship is his family happy and successful, and does Marty get the home life he feels he deserves.To really drill down into this, it’s somewhat heartbreaking that in neither reality do his parents fall in love simply by knowing each other. There has to be some sort of catalytic event to force the two together, whether that’s by the father being hit by a car and cared for by the mother or – as in the second reality where they end up happier, richer and more in love – by the father saving the mother from an horrific and traumatic sexual assault. It’s a strange message for a family film.In the end, Back to the Future leaves me with many unanswered questions – not about plot holes, exactly, but about the infinite loop created when you mess about with the time-space continuum. When did Doc and McFly actually first meet? What happens to Einstein the dog? When did Doc actually invent time travel? If time travel ever really catches on, will we still be in control of our own thoughts and actions, or will they be dictated by future versions of ourselves who have gone back to the past? Could time travel eradicate our free will?Forgive me, I’ve been inside for a long time. But one question has been answered by my partner, a lifelong BTTF BFF, I’ll have to watch Back to the Future 2 for those hoverboards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/839f7e8508e8e0db93f4452624b5601315a4bbc1/0_172_3696_2219/master/3696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e19d5821eda1247ec2957cef2bf46f1","title":"results film guy pearce andrew bujalski","story":"Continuing a series of writers highlighting underseen films available to stream, a recommendation for a warm and humane comedy about an unusual love triangleWhen critics talk about the “mumblecore” movement – a catch-all term for the intimate, unadorned and semi-improvisational films that flourished with the rise of the digital camera – they at least have the courtesy to credit Andrew Bujalski as its progenitor with Funny Ha Ha in 2002. Yet in that film and the two deft relationship comedies that followed, Mutual Appreciation and Beeswax, Bujalski was genuinely attempting something new, reproducing the common conversational hiccups that get buffed out of screenplay. The “ums” and sentence fragments and awkward little stops-and-starts not only fed into a distinct naturalism, but underlined the uncertainty at the core of his characters’ lives. He’s a poet of postgrad drift.In the past few years, Bujalski has been figuring out how to scale up his work with larger (though still very modest) budgets and professional actors while still making it recognizably his own. His efforts coalesced beautifully in 2018’s Support the Girls, a sharply observed slice-of-life set in a downscale Hooters-style “breastaurant” on the brink. It may be the closest anyone has gotten to approximating the generosity and warmth of a Jonathan Demme movie since Demme died in 2017, yet there’s a subtle, deliberate messiness to it that’s pure Bujalski.It’s also a great reason to go back and revisit Results, the underrated comedy Bujalski made three years before Support the Girls. The two films dig into the quirky ecosystems of suburban businesses, those fly-by-night operations that pop in and out of strip malls, destined to upend the lives of employees living paycheck to paycheck. In the meantime, they absorb the petty indignities of customer service, screw around during pockets of downtime, and casually eye the next gig that comes along. Their managers show more ambition, but they’re usually too busy putting out fires to reach that next rung on the social ladder.In Results, the dodgy business in question is Power 4 Life, a small gym with a manager, Trevor (Guy Pearce), who believes whole-heartedly in an all-encompassing philosophy of self-improvement – the “4” stands for physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual – while his employees and customers mostly see it as a place to work out. His star trainer is Kat (Cobie Smulders), who succeeds mainly in terrorizing her clients into submission when she spots one munching on a cookie, she runs full speed towards her minivan like Robert Patrick in Terminator 2. That cookie won’t be included on the “food log”, and the lies and excuses send Kat into a fury.Kat seems like precisely the wrong trainer for Danny (Kevin Corrigan), a lumpen slacker who fell into a massive inheritance just weeks after a orce. His fitness goal is to be able to take a punch “without puking or pleading too much.” Kat should be repulsed by him, but she finds his lack of hypocrisy refreshing – not only does he not lie on his food log, but sends her photographs of the pizzas and other depression cuisine he’s jamming down his gullet. The two of them smoke weed in his rented McMansion and watch the widescreen TV he paid a Craigslist user $200 to turn on.Trevor and Danny are infatuated by Kat. She and Trevor had an early fling, chalked up to an occupational hazard for “fit, sweaty people who work together” Danny keeps stealing glances of her doing knee bends, showing him how to lead with his butt. All three are throughly calamitous human beings – Trevor a mass of insecurities despite his holistic philosophy, Kat listless and full of anger, Danny so inept that he doesn’t know how to spend his own money.Enjoying Results involves getting on its unusual wavelength. Bujalski gets plenty of laughs from his characters’ foibles, but he’s an observational director, not a gagsmith. And he doesn’t want to force this love triangle to resolve itself too easily, either. People stumble through their lives just like they stumble through sentences in his early work. With each new comedy, he’s trying to find a cinema to accommodate that. It’s not as easy as it looks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b54436776c67c1d7abe72e30bb21a8b61385dcf/0_452_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b147640ecc93f7681d9ad59332143d7","title":"sweeten your tinned tomatoes and 29 other tips for simpler tastier home cooking","story":"A former chef shares what she learned over three decades, from how to keep your pans good as new to the virtue of storing ginger in the freezerHoled up at home, many of us are doing way more cooking than usual. Maybe you are enjoying it – or maybe you are trying to put in a working day at a corner of the kitchen table, dreading the preparation of the next meal.I worked as a chef for almost 30 years. Although I am now a full-time writer, I haven’t managed to escape the kitchen: I am currently feeding four strapping adults. I don’t always enjoy cooking, but I have had so much practice that I can get a reasonable meal on the table without much fuss. Here are some of the things I have learned that might make your lives a bit easier.1 If you think your food isn’t tasty, it may be because many home cooks don’t use enough salt and pepper. Season as you go, taste, season again. You can’t get flavour into a shepherd’s pie by sprinkling a bit on at the table. You need to sort that before you assemble it.2 If a recipe says: “Cook the onions until they are translucent, about three minutes,” it is lying. It takes 10 to 15 minutes to achieve this. Meanwhile, it is likely they will start to colour, which leads me on to the next thing.3 Water is your friend. A splash will stop your onions from burning, thin that sauce, make that pastry rollable.4 When you cut an onion, it releases a vapour that reacts with the first wet thing it finds. If that happens to be your eyeballs, you will cry. If your knife is wet and you have rinsed the onion, you will cry less. I am not sure of the science, but I know that it helps.5 If you are going to roast or bake something for dinner, add a tray of veg for lunch the next day, or a cake. Cheaper and better for the planet.6 You may be baking with kids. Do not begin with scones. Like pastry, scones need the gentlest touch. Make bread, fairy cakes or a Victoria sandwich that will survive the assault.7 We are getting hardly any exercise and this could go on for weeks or months. Baking a cake with your kids every other day isn’t sustainable. Get them to help with actual meals. Small ones can roll meatballs or falafels, pick herbs, mash avocados.8 Older ones can use knives, peelers, graters. It is up to you to decide what age or which child my daughter was handy with a knife at seven or eight, but there are adults I wouldn’t like to see wielding a blade. If you have teenagers, tell them to get out of bed and make lunch.9 It is good to look in your fridge and come up with new dishes, but some combinations just don’t work. I was once served sardines with strawberry puree. It was muck. Mackerel with pickled rhubarb, on the other hand, was sublime. Think about what you are doing.10 Maldon is my favourite salt, but it is not cheap. Use any old salt for boiling pasta etc and use the good stuff when you will notice the difference.11 Don’t be afraid of heat. Most domestic stoves can’t reach the temperatures an industrial one can. As soon as you throw a steak, a chicken breast, a chop or a bag of mince on a pan, the temperature will plummet. You will be left with a pale, simmering stew rather than a burnished prime cut.12 When frying steaks, oil the meat, not the pan. This goes for cooking anything on a ridged grill pan, from halloumi to asparagus. And season after oiling or the salt will eat into the food.13 To clean a cast-iron pan, rub on salt with a piece of old tinfoil. When the food residue is gone, wipe a wee bit of oil on the pan to keep it from rusting. This is my father’s tip. He says reusing the foil “will keep that nice wee Swedish girl happy”. He means Greta Thunberg. He isn’t great with names.14 “From scratch” doesn’t mean you can’t take shortcuts. I can’t be bothered to roast and skinpeppers for romesco or muhammara. Lidl sells them in jars if you rinse them well, they work a treat.15 You are not cooking in a restaurant. Some dishes are impossible to recreate perfectly at home. Commercial pizza ovens are set at two temperatures: very hot on the bottom for a crispy base and cooler on top so as not to burn the cheese. Accept this or get a takeaway.16 Most restaurant cookbooks are for the coffee table. You are cooking your way through a lockdown. For the purposes of this exercise, foams and gels are for the bathroom. Getting an omelette and chips to the table is no mean feat.17 I worked in some decent kitchens, but never in one where we made vegetable or chicken stock. (The bubbling pot of what is known as “jus” is another story.) It is OK to buy them, although they vary quite a bit. Some taste too strongly of celery some contain gluten or MSG. Try them out.18 That said, I make chicken stock most weeks. I roast two chickens and serve one for dinner. The other I strip down for coronation chicken or a pie. I put both carcasses in a slow cooker overnight with water and aromatics then use the stock for soup, risotto, etc.19 Which aromatics? Onion, leek, carrot, celery, bay, thyme, parsley, black peppercorns. The trimmings of spring onions, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms. I rarely have all these at once and often make it with just onion and a bay leaf. A big no to garlic, starchy stuff like spuds or anything resembling cabbage. And I always add a single clove.20 Dress pasta, rice, potatoes and noodle salads when they are warm. Hot, they will absorb all the dressing. Cold, they will absorb none of it.21 I love my food processor, but I loathe cleaning it. I do dry stuff in it first – making breadcrumbs, chopping nuts – then wipe it with kitchen paper. Then I do any grating, chopping or slicing and rinse it before liquidising or pureeing.22 I keep root ginger in the freezer and leave it out for five minutes before grating. Then I freeze it again.23 Most chefs use chopped tinned tomatoes for cooking because the whole ones take so long to break down or need to be chopped or liquidised. They always need to be sweetened. Do it to taste, but go easy or there will be a ketchupy vibe.24 Use a serrated knife to slice fresh tomatoes. I have a small one that I use for lemons, too, or you can use a steak knife or the bread knife. Tomatoes will wreck your straight blade – blunt it almost immediately. I don’t know why, but they will.25 Chefs have this thing called mise en place, where all their ingredients are prepped and laid out in front of them before they begin. I am not recommending that you buy a set of identical glass dishes, but maybe consider getting all your chopping out of the way before you start and laying it in separate little piles on one big plate or tray.26 Some pastry chefs use crème pâtissière in desserts such as trifle. It contains a little flour and is easier and quicker to make – and less likely to burn than crème anglaise (runny custard).27 If you can find everything you want in the shops these days, you are doing better than me. Besides, supermarkets are traumatising now, with their bogging trolley handles and pandemic-yellow floor stickers. Make substitutions. I made a reasonable sort of hummus with butter beans. Rocket works instead of parsley. Cashews and walnuts are OK in pesto.28 You can switch ingredients when baking, but be careful. Baking is chemistry. The other day, I made brown bread, adding oat bran and milled chia seeds instead of the wheatgerm and wheat bran the recipe called for. It needed extra liquid, possibly because chia seeds are thirsty.29 At the end of each shift, chefs clean down every surface. Out of habit, I do this and have never had to use steel wool or strong chemicals on my hob. It is 13 years old and could pass for new. I am otherwise a slattern, by the way.30 Salt is controversial. So is sugar. If you are supposed to avoid them for medical reasons, then do so. Obviously. If you like your own cooking, keep doing what you are doing. These are not commandments, just the musings of a virus-freaked oldie.• The End of the World Is a Cul de Sac, Louise Kennedy’s debut short story collection, will be published by Bloomsbury in January 2021"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca5c874001a0b6dde32ba30a9407add6dae31df/0_33_1366_819/master/1366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e092fb194b6dd869a1137ed2404494fd","title":"nigel slater easy egg recipes souffle tagliatelle cheese croissants","story":"Asparagus souffle, mushroom tagliatelle, baked cheese croissants, apricot and lemon curd cake – seven delicious recipes that are as good as goldI long to break into the freckled shell of a boiled egg and lift its snow white and deep orange heart with a teaspoon. I even find myself gazing at a fluffy omelette, its baveuse interior oozing out as the fork goes in. But alas, there is no cheque large enough to tempt me to eat an egg. Whether boiled, scrambled, poached or fried, the egg has always been my culinary bête noir. I like my oeufs well and truly hidden. Custard, cake, meringue or mayonnaise are among my favourite things to eat, as is a souffle, a creme caramel or a mousse, but the egg must always be in total disguise. I have been like this all my life and I reluctantly admit that, at this age, my aversion is unlikely to change.But I don’t write this column for myself, I write it for you and, let’s be honest, most sensible people do find the egg one of the most indispensable ingredients in the kitchen. So eggs it is, cheap and as cheerful as a sunny spring morning. In the recipes that follow there are crisp golden croissants cooked in the style of eggy bread eggs briefly baked with pink prawns and scarlet chillies, there are egg whites in a souffle and yolks in a peppercorn-spiked mayonnaise. I have also made a tender loaf cake with dried apricots and homemade lemon curd, and a garlic-flecked tangle of tagliatelle. Who knows, I may eat that boiled egg yet.A simple dish of baked eggs with shellfish and aromatics. You can use prawns, tiny beige brown shrimps or crayfish tails here. This is a quick supper so I would probably buy them ready shelled rather than shell my own. Use Italian basil if the deliciously aniseedy Thai variety proves evasive. And I would bring some bread to the table too, a crusty baguette to tear apart and dip into the softly quivering egg.Serves 2spring onions 2red chilli 2 largeThai basil leaves 10shelled crayfish tails or prawns 150geggs 4groundnut oil 2 tbspnori flakes 2 tsptoasted sesame seeds 1 tbspSet the oven to 230C fangas mark 8. Roughly chop the spring onions. (I like to cut them diagonally into 2cm lengths.) Chop the chilli similarly.Put the basil leaves and the crayfish tails or prawns into a medium-sized baking dish. Break the eggs into the dish, then scatter the onion and chilli over the top. Trickle the oil over and season with salt and black pepper.Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven until the eggs have just set. Scatter the nori flakes and toasted sesame seeds over.Late last Sunday morning, I brought to the table a batch of croissants cooked in the style of pain perdu, but stuffed with dark curls of speck and pools of melted fontina. Deliciously crisp and brown, the cheese formed pizza-style strings and they disappeared in minutes. Other cheeses will work here, but a semi-hard, easy to grate cheese is best.Makes 4eggs 6grain mustard 1 tbspmilk 100mlcroissants 4 large fontina 150gspeck or other air-dried ham 8 thin slicesSet the oven at 200C fangas mark 6.Break the eggs into a mixing bowl and whisk them lightly to combine yolks and whites. Stir in the mustard and 100ml of the milk.Using a breadknife, cut the croissants in half horizontally then dunk them in the egg and milk, pushing them down so they are thoroughly soaked. Lay the bottom halves of each croissant side by side in a baking dish or roasting tin.Grate the fontina. Divide the speck between the croissants, tearing it as necessary, then sprinkle 25g of cheese over each of the ham-covered halves. Place the top halves back in place on each croissant, then scatter over any remaining cheese.Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes till the cheese has melted.I have always enjoyed making mayonnaise, except for the rare occasion when it fails (normally on very humid or thundery days). The speed at which you add the oil really does make all the difference. I start with a few, large single drops, increasing the flow to never more than a mere trickle. Adding too much oil in one go will almost always result in a curdled mayonnaise.The green peppercorns you need are the soft, dark green variety sold in little jars of brine. I like the brief bursts of heat you get from adding them whole, but you could crush them using a pestle and mortar for a more even, gradual heat. If you don’t have any peppercorns in the cupboard, keep the recipe for another time.For the mayonnaiseegg yolks 3dijon mustard 2 tspcider vinegar 1 tspgroundnut oil 100mlolive oil 50mlgreen peppercorns in brine 1 tspdill 10gFor the saladwhite chicory 2 headsred chicory 2 small headsparsley a small bunchdill a few sprigsFor the mayonnaise, put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and cider vinegar. Mix thoroughly, then slowly add the oils, a drop at time, whisking continuously with a large balloon whisk accelerating to a steady stream as the mayonnaise starts to thicken.Drain the green peppercorns of their brine but don’t rinse them, add them to the mayonnaise. Finely chop the dill, stir into the mayonnaise, cover and refrigerate.Separate the chicory leaves and wash in cold running water. Dry them in a salad spinner or on a tea towel, then put them in a large serving bowl. Tear the parsley leaves and dill fronds from the stems and add them to the chicory. Pour over the mayonnaise dressing and toss gently to coat the leaves.Place 2 smoked trout fillets on each plate, sprinkle a little cider vinegar over the fillets, then place some of the chicory mayonnaise at their side.A hint of springtime here with tiny mushrooms and a faint breath of aniseed. As you twirl the tagliatelle round your fork, the egg yolk is very lightly cooked by the residual heat of the freshly drained pasta. (That said, this isn’t a recipe for anyone who wants to avoid raw egg.) Chervil, which I find from time to time at the greengrocer, adds a light aniseed note to this tangle of pasta and parmesan. It is isn’t the easiest herb to get hold of, and if you can’t find its delicate lace-like leaves you could use tarragon.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt generously.Cut the mushrooms into quarters or in thick slices, as you wish. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the mushrooms and let them cook, with the occasional stir or shake, for 8-10 minutes till golden and starting to crisp.Chop the black garlic and add to the mushrooms then turn off the heat. The garlic will cook in the residual heat.Cook the tagliatelle in the boiling water for 8 or 9 minutes till al dente, then drain and immediately toss with the mushrooms, garlic and chopped parsley. Add the chervil leaves then ide between two plates or pasta bowls. Break the eggs and separate the white and yolks (you only need the yolks). Add a yolk to the middle of each dish then grate the parmesan over. Stir the egg yolk and cheese into the pasta as you eat.I look forward to the arrival of the first locally grown asparagus in spring with the same excitement I do the first gooseberries of summer, or the damsons of early autumn. It is the clearest of seasonal markers, the first true sign that spring is well and truly here. And yes, it does seem to appear earlier with each passing year and I have no problem with that. You could make an asparagus souffle by boiling and pureeing the tips and folding them in with the egg whites, but that would be to lose much of the elegance of the spears themselves. I prefer to cook the souffle in a shallow baking dish with the spears peeping through the cheesy clouds.Serves 2-3To prepare the dishbutter a knobparmesan 2 tbsp, finely gratedasparagus 12 spearsFor the soufflemilk 300mlbay leaf 1onion 1 small, peeledtarragon 15g, leaves picked and choppedbutter 55gflour 50geggs 4 large, separatedstrongly flavoured, firm cheese such as yarg, gruyere or cheddar 125g, grated or cut into small piecesparmesan 3tbsp, gratedLightly butter the inside of a baking dish measuring about 28cm x 22cm, then scatter in the 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan, tipping the dish from side to side to make sure the cheese sticks to the butter.Cook the asparagus in boiling water for 8 minutes then drain on kitchen paper. Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 6. Bring the milk to the boil in a small pan together with the bay leaf and onion. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Melt the butter in a small, heavy-based saucepan, stir in the flour and leave over the heat for two or three minutes, stirring almost continuously. (You can chuck the bay and onion at this point – they have done their work.) Stir in the warm milk, gradually at first, then a little faster, till you have a thick sauce. Let it come to an enthusiastic bubble, then lower the heat and let the mixture simmer for at least 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until it is thick and smooth. If your sauce looks lumpy, then whisk fiercely until it is smooth and thick. Remove from the heat, cool briefly, then stir or whisk in the egg yolks, one at a time. Work quickly, otherwise the egg will cook before it gets stirred in.Stir the grated cheese and chopped tarragon into the sauce. In a large bowl, using a large balloon whisk beat the egg whites till stiff and frothy. Fold them gently but firmly into the cheese sauce, then immediately scrape into the buttered dish.Place the spears of asparagus on top of the cheese sauce, then scatter the grated parmesan over. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes till puffed and golden.As I took this still warm cake from the oven, the scent of citrus and butter wafted up, reminding me of why I bake rather than buy. There are three elements here: the apricot sponge itself the lemon curd and the crumble that crowns the cake. This is not a recipe to hurry. Instead, a piece of baking to take your time over, an hour or two of quiet hands-on time in the kitchen, perhaps with the radio on and no distractions. The finished cake will keep for several days in a cake tin. We ate it as both tea-time treat (with a pot of fresh mint tea) and as dessert, with a spoonful of thick yogurt nudging against the crumble crust. The recipe makes slightly more lemon curd than you need, but it will keep for a week in a stoppered jar in the fridge. A truly splendid thing when spread thickly on hot, toasted muffins.Serves 8For the lemon curdunwaxed lemons 4caster sugar 200gbutter 100geggs 3egg yolk 1For the cakebutter 125gcaster sugar 125gself-raising flour 75gground almonds 75geggs 3 mediumsoft dried apricots 75gicing sugar for dustingFor the crumblebutter 80gplain flour 110gdemerara sugar 3 tbspicing sugar 2 tbspYou will need a 20cm x 10cm x 7cm rectangular loaf tin lined with baking parchment.Make the lemon curd: finely grate the lemons, then squeeze their juice. Put the lemon zest and juice, the sugar and the butter, cut into cubes, into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the basin doesn’t touch the water. Stir with a whisk from time to time until the butter has melted.Mix the eggs and egg yolk lightly with a fork, then stir into the lemon mixture. Let the curd cook, stirring regularly, for about 10 minutes, until it is thick and custard-like. It should feel heavy on the whisk. Remove from the heat and stir occasionally as it cools.Make the cake: cream the butter and caster sugar together until light and fluffy. This is best done using a food mixer. Stir together the flour and ground almonds. Break the eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork or small whisk. Chop the apricots finely using a food processor.While the butter and sugar are creaming together, make the crumble. Rub the 80g of butter, in small pieces, into the flour, then stir in the demerara sugar and set aside. Set the oven at 180C fangas mark 4. Line the cake tin.Add the beaten egg, a little at a time, to the creamed butter and caster sugar. If the mixture starts to curdle, then add a few tablespoons of the flour to bring it together. Mix in the flour and chopped apricots.Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf tin and smooth the surface. Spoon in 250g of the lemon curd and smooth the surface. Trickle a teaspoon or two of cold water over the crumble mix and shake the dish so the crumbs form a mixture of fine and coarse lumps. It makes for a more interestingly textured crumble. Tip the crumble over the lemon curd then bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until lightly firm.Remove the cake from the oven and set aside to rest until almost cool. Remove the cake from the tin, peel away the parchment, dust the cake with icing sugar and serve.For the praline creamshelled pistachios 75gcaster sugar 150gdouble cream 250mldried rose petals a handfulPut a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Break the chocolate into small pieces, and let it melt in the bowl without stirring. Remove from the heat as soon as the chocolate is liquid, add the butter in small pieces and stir, very briefly, then add the hot coffee, stirring gently.Separate the eggs and beat the whites until they are almost stiff. Stir the egg yolks into the melted chocolate then fold the whites in, making sure there are no lumps of unincorporated egg white.Put the bowl in the fridge, covered, and leave for at least four hours to set.Shortly before you wish to eat, make the praline: put the pistachios and sugar into a large, shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Let the sugar melt and turn a dark amber. Try to avoid stirring and instead, move the pan left and right, encouraging the caramel to melt evenly.When the sugar has all melted and you have rich, mid-brown caramel, pour onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to set.Break the praline into pieces and reduce to coarse crumbs in a food processor, or by crushing and shattering with a rolling pin. Lightly whip the cream until it is almost stiff then fold in most of the crushed praline.Spoon large scoops of mousse onto plates, then add an almost equal amount of praline cream to each. Scatter over the reserved crushed praline, and if you have any, a few dried or fresh rose petals.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08a7ef07f2ad618f3ddc43b5526e78f5514cd18b/0_0_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93192265cbf0a73f0b083d61cda185d9","title":"from srloth to luis alberto 20 players who have thrived after leaving england","story":"These players, one from each Premier League club, may not have made much of an impression in England but have proven their worth elsewhereArsenal – Kristoffer Olsson (Krasnodar) In two years at Arsenal the Swede appeared in one matchday squad and made it on to the pitch for 36 minutes of a League Cup tie at West Brom (scoring in the penalty shootout). He moved on, initially to Midtjylland in Denmark, and after a spell at AIK in Sweden he joined Krasnodar in January 2019. This season he has been a key player in midfield, with his team second in Russia’s Premier League.Aston Villa – Pierluigi Gollini (Atalanta) A £4.25m signing from the Serie B side Hellas Verona in 2016, Gollini held down a first-team spot for barely four months before Steve Bruce brought in Mark Bunn, more than 10 years Gollini’s senior, before Christmas. “Bunn gives you that bit of experience,” he said. “I just felt with young Pier, it was a bit too much for him. I find him very young.” The following month he joined Atalanta, initially on loan, and he has been their first-choice goalkeeper since March 2019. He has had an outstanding season and made his full international debut in November.Bournemouth – Max Gradel (Toulouse) Not just an automatic first choice when fit but Toulouse’s captain, the Ivorian contributed 13 goals and 10 assists last season – his best statistics since the year at Saint-Étienne that convinced Bournemouth to sign him in the summer of 2015. He spent two seasons on the south coast, starting 11 league games in the first and none in the second. This season he has three goals and three assists in 21 appearances in Ligue 1.Brighton – Mathias Normann (Rostov) The then 21-year-old Norwegian signed in the summer of 2017, swiftly departed again on loan to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Molde. After returning for the first half of the following season he made a permanent move to Rostov in January 2019 without ever being considered worthy of a place in Brighton’s first-team squad. The defensive midfielder has been a regular ever since, starting all 18 league games he has been available for this season and finishing 17, scoring one (excellent) goal.Burnley – Rouwen Hennings (Fortuna Düsseldorf) The German striker made only three league starts, scoring one goal, at Burnley during the 2015-16 season. “We’re not expecting miracles out of him,” Sean Dyche said. “He’s shown signs and glimmers of what he’s about and we think there’s more to come.” There was, though nobody saw it until he had been sent back to Germany on a free transfer. He started this season spectacularly, scoring 10 league goals by the end of November and though he could not keep up that pace his tally of 11 puts him fifth in the Bundesliga scoring charts.Chelsea – Marko Marin (al-Ahli) Chelsea spent around £7m to sign the then 23-year-old midfielder from Werder Bremen in 2012. He had already won 16 full caps and been a member of Germany’s squad for the 2010 World Cup but the move did not work out: he made only two league starts and played a total of 142 league minutes before heading out on a series of loan deals. He eventually joined Olympiakos in 2016 for around £2.5m. Now 31 he moved to the Saudi club al-Ahli in January having captained Crvena Zvezda in the first half of the season, including every minute of the Serbian side’s Champions League campaign (they lost 5-0 and 4-0 to Spurs, and 3-0 and 6-0 to Bayern Munich, but he set up two goals in their one victory, at home to Olympiakos).Crystal Palace – Alexander Sørloth (Trabzonspor) The Norwegian praised “a big club with ambition, a good club who takes good care of its players” when he signed in January 2018 but after four games without a goal he was dropped, destined never to make another league start in England. But a player who scored only once in this country, against Swansea in the League Cup, has become the best marksman in Turkey, where he has scored 19 and created six in 26 appearances this season.Everton – Joel Robles (Real Betis) Between August 2013 and May 2018 the Spaniard spent 140 Premier League games on Everton’s bench and managed 39 starts. There were periods when he looked to have made the goalkeeper’s jersey his own but none was very long signed for £3.6m, he left on a free transfer and after spending last season as back-up at Real Betis he has stepped up following Pau López moved to Roma last summer.Leicester – Andrej Kramaric (Hoffenheim) The Croat became Leicester’s record signing for £9.7m in January 2015. “He’s an extremely talented young footballer,” said Nigel Pearson of the then 23-year-old. “He is potentially a very important addition to us.” That potential was never realised: he started five of next seven games and continued to make regular substitute appearances but spent only 22 minutes on the pitch in 2015-16. He joined Hoffenheim, initially on loan, almost exactly a year after his arrival. His five goals helped keep the club up that season and he made the move permanent in the summer of 2016. He has never left their first team, has scored 45 league goals in his three complete seasons and despite suffering several injuries had seven to his name when play stopped in March.Liverpool – Luis Alberto (Lazio) Liverpool spent £6.8m to sign the 20-year-old Spaniard, who could play across the forward line, in 2013, with Brendan Rodgers trilling “he has the correct footballing profile and mentality to be a Liverpool player”. He never started a league game, making nine substitute appearances, and never scored before joining Lazio three years later for £4.3m. He barely played in his first season but since 2017 has been a regular and this season, in a more withdrawn role at the base of midfield, has created 13 goals in 25 games – the most in Serie A – while scoring four of his own.Manchester City – Olarenwaju Kayode (Gaziantep) A curious one, this. The Nigerian had been Austria’s top scorer before City snapped up the then 24-year-old from Austria Vienna in the summer of 2017 for £3.5m. But he never played for the club, instead moving immediately on loan to Girona. After starting two league games and scoring no goals he was sent back again in January 2018, saw a move to Amiens collapse for “administrative reasons” and had a disappointing spell at Shakhtar Donetsk. He is now shining in Turkey, where he has nine goals and six assists this season.Manchester United – Guillermo Varela (Copenhagen) After signing in 2013 aged 20 Varela had to wait two years for a chance but under Louis van Gaal in 2015-16 the Uruguayan was integrated into the first-team, making regular appearances in league and cups. “He’s performing like he’s been playing for 10 years,” Juan Mata said. “He’s a very competitive guy, he’s good for the team so we are very happy for him.” Then he started against Liverpool in the Europa League, did too little to stop Philippe Coutinho’s run as he scored a brilliant goal just before half-time, was taken off at the break and never played again. He went on loan to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2016-17 but when a tattoo engraved against club instructions became infected before the cup final he was dropped, fined and sent back in disgrace. In 2017 he returned to his first club, Peñarol, but came back to Europe in January 2019 to join Copenhagen and was enjoying the best season of his career before play was suspended in March.Newcastle – Mikel Merino (Real Sociedad) During Merino’s single season at Newcastle his ability was evident but Rafael Benítez was not fully convinced by his Spanish compatriot. He managed only two league starts between the end of 2017 and the end of the campaign, because he was unable to dislodge Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diamé in central midfield. He started 24 of 38 league games last season but 25 of 26 this year as Real Sociedad unexpectedly rose to fourth in the table.Norwich City – Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe (Gent) Norwich spent around £4.5m to sign the 25-year-old Belgium midfielder in the summer of 2014. He started only one league game as Norwich won promotion in his first year and three in the Premier League the following season before being allowed to join Legia Warsaw on a free transfer. He was Poland’s player of the following season but after one year moved to Olympiakos, where he experienced a chaotic campaign featuring three managers. In April was told by the club’s chairman – and owner of Nottingham Forest – Evangelos Marinakis that he had no future there. He joined Gent in the summer of 2018 and became the captain this season. He had scored three goals and created eight when play was suspended.Southampton – Martín Cáceres (Fiorentina) Cáceres had already played for Juventus and Barcelona, as well as winning 68 caps for Uruguay, before he joined the Saints as a free agent in February 2017. Of the 13 league games between his arrival and the end of the season he started 12 on the bench, finished 12 on the bench, and actually appeared only once, in a 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough that May. He has since been passed around Serie A clubs – from Hellas Verona to Lazio, to Juventus, and then last summer to Fiorentina, where has has started 20 of the 22 league games he has been available for. He turned 33 this month (7 April).Tottenham – Milos Veljkovic (Werder Bremen) Spurs spotted Veljkovic when the Serb was a 15-year-old at Basle and signed him a few weeks before his 16th birthday in 2011. He was at the club for nearly five years in which time he made three appearances, of two, 28 and four minutes’ duration respectively. Loan moves to Charlton and Middlesbrough were unproductive and in January 2016 he left for Werder Bremen, who paid around £500,000. He has made 97 league appearances there and is once again a mainstay in defence after recovering from a broken toe that kept him out of the first five games.Sheffield United – Aymen Tahar (Panetolikos) The Sheffield-born midfielder of Algerian extraction came through the club’s youth system but left in the summer of 2010 having made the first-team squad once and played a single minute of senior football in an FA Cup defeat by Hull City. When he joined Staveley Miners Welfare a future of globetrotting success seemed unlikely but a move to the Romanian side Gaz Metan Medias proved successful. He has since played for Steaua Bucharest (where he made three Champions League appearances, albeit in the qualifying rounds) and Boavista. He left Portugal last summer to join Panetolikos in Greece’s top ision and he has been involved in 20 of their 23 league games this season, all but three as a starter.Watford – Steven Berghuis (Feyenoord) The Dutch winger lasted one season at Watford, arriving at the age of 23, before moving to Feyenoord, initially on loan. Of 38 Premier League games he was in the squad for only 16, made appearances in nine and started none. This season he is the Ereisie’s joint top scorer and joint third on the list of assists.Wolves – Silvio (Vitoria Setúbal) One year, four starts and four managers was the extent of Silvio’s experience in England but he has gone on to become a key player with Setúbal in his native Portugal: this season he has missed one match through illness and played every minute of the other 23."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/784dc45e192585ebf4e7c6155a4cf611fe27958d/0_204_1004_602/master/1004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f558a0b2a8fb6dae3cb75690f7efe5f","title":"dexter blackstock supplying ppe former striker equipment to frontline staff coronavirus","story":"Former striker runs a medical technology firm and hopes to distribute £1m of equipment to frontline staff amid coronavirusI have been on hold for a few minutes, waiting for our interview to resume, when Dexter Blackstock comes back on the line and starts apologising for leaving me hanging. Given the reason for the delay, however, this really isn’t a case of bad manners. “Sorry,” Blackstock says. “That was just 500,000 masks coming into the country. They’ve just landed. It’s come from China and will go straight out to councils.”No wonder Blackstock, who has been building connections in the pharmaceutical world since retiring from football in 2017, is in demand. The 33-year-old former Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest striker is the founder and CEO of a medical technology firm, MediConnect, and all he can think about now is getting personal protective equipment to frontline staff dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. “This is from when I wake up to when I sleep,” Blackstock says. “The demand is through the roof.”It hardly needs pointing out that this is not a straightforward project. NHS staff are saying they do not have enough access to PPE, while a crisis is brewing in care homes and hospices in the United Kingdom. Yet Blackstock is confident that MediConnect, a Blockchain solution, can help. His company is accepting donations from the public via a crowd-funding website, donatetonhs, and he has enlisted the support of Blackburn’s Bradley Johnson, who has given his time to the project and committed to delivering life-saving equipment to frontline staff near his home in Derby.“What MediConnect is meant for is to provide transparency for all parties within the supply chain,” Blackstock explains. “It’s to add traceability of medications, to stop opioid addiction. I was building the platform for a couple of years. You have to build a relationship with everyone along the supply chain – pharmacies, manufacturers, distributors, logistics companies – to bring it all together.“PPE is one of the biggest problems people are struggling with. I have the connections – instead of people just coming out the woodwork – which means you can actually get the product. I can help source this.”The idea grew after a conversation about fund-raising initiatives between Blackstock and Johnson, who has nothing but good to say about his friend’s entrepreneurial spirit. The website has already raised more than £12,000. Each donation can be followed up by an email request, directing it be supplied to wherever people feel it is needed.“When people donate they can see what we’re spending the money on and what supplies we’re getting,” Johnson says. “It’s a step-by-step transaction. They can donate and once we make the order we’ll put it on our website so people can see the amount of stuff we’re getting.”The aim is to go further than hospitals. “We know now how much of a shortage the NHS is going through,” Johnson says. “We want to target the NHS but also the care homes or key workers – like bus drivers who are putting their lives at risk transporting NHS staff. If we get in contact with people in Derby I’ll go out and deliver. We want it to be known we’re doing something. We’re not just sitting at home, wanting people’s money and then letting others do the work. We’re going to do it ourselves.”Blackstock was 31 when he hung up his boots. He was going through the motions at Rotherham but he had planned for the future. Now he is in a position to talk about the shortage of PPE. “It’s like toilet paper a few weeks ago,” he says. “The product can be made in the quantity required. But if everyone rushes at one time you can’t get it. If everyone in England decides to go and buy baked beans tomorrow, there won’t be enough. The rush has been too quick and the numbers are too much. The problem wasn’t the PPE, it’s just the time.“And there are a lot of people who’ve come out of the woodwork in between who are blocking deals or buying up the stock at the same time, meaning the government can’t buy it. This is worldwide. A lot of it is coming from China. China physically can’t produce that amount.“The NHS has an endless backlog. They’re kind of bullying the supplier to say: ‘We’re the biggest players, we’ll pay the most money, we need it.’ But what is happening is the councils, the care homes, the hospices and everyone below can’t get the product. So there’s not enough that can be made to distribute. England have not got access to every warehouse in China or product worldwide.”It sounds like a tricky world to negotiate. “You’ve seen some people sending money to factories that are not even there,” Blackstock says. “It’s really bad. If I just woke up today and tried to source PPE I’d get robbed from the first batch. I wouldn’t know where to go, I wouldn’t know how shipment works. I’d be finished. It can only be done from previous relationships, which I have.”Blackstock, who hopes to distribute £1m worth of equipment, speaks passionately on the issues in care homes. “Everyone has a feeling towards the NHS, but what I want to do more is get this money into the care homes, the hospices,” he says. “They are on their knees. It’s not like we’re running out – we have run out for those people.“It’s the food chain. If the NHS has a shortage, where does anyone below come? If you’re on the frontline, you need equipment and the best of it. But if you’re just a care home you’re not going to be at the top and they’re really struggling. They’ve been contacting me, saying: ‘We need 100 masks, we need 500 masks, we’ve got nothing, we’ve been using the masks too long.’ They’re worried. There might be places that might not have positive-tested Covid-19 patients at the moment but could at any minute. It’s spreading fast across the care homes.”It is an initiative that jabs against the depiction of footballers as greedy and shielded from reality. “I’ll never forget where I’ve come from,” Johnson says. “My mum and dad didn’t struggle, but we had a tough upbringing. I come from a working-class family so I know how hard it is for some of these families. I’ll always remember that. The negative press, it’s sad we don’t get credit for the good stuff we do. Everyone’s quick to jump on the negative. That’s life. Me and Dex want to help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9ae56fcafcebabfedb1bd929cf24c694bb5837/0_139_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e351abd80f481e29461deafb29ff9a","title":"my favourite game everton v rapid vienna 1985 cup winners cup final","story":"It took some wrangling but I was in Rotterdam when Everton won their first European trophy on an unforgettable nightI had accepted I would not be going to the 1985 Cup Winners’ Cup final about halfway through the second leg of the semi-final, when a British Rail guard informed “anyone who’s interested” that Everton were 1-0 down to Bayern Munich. I was on a train to Lime Street and somewhere around Watford Junction at the time.Luton had already been beaten in the FA Cup semi-final and a 0-0 at Bayern in the first leg had opened up the possibility of two finals in the same week – or more likely for me, one. If I was lucky. The problem was I had just finished my first two-week stint as a steward on a cross-Channel ferry, which involved working a fortnight on and and a fortnight off, and both finals were in the middle of my second stint.I assumed the guard had a radio in his carriage but he did not come back with any news so thoughts drifted towards the Wembley option and I noticed some lads with blue and white colours as we rolled into Crewe a couple of hours later. I asked them the score and was shocked to be told Everton had won 3-1.That was that then, and the good news was that my ferry line sailed to Vlissingen in the Netherlands, so I would be more than halfway to Rotterdam if I could get the time off. Two weeks of limbo followed, but when I got back to Kent I managed to persuade someone from the opposite shift to cover me for 48 hours. I bought a match ticket from an Everton fan in the passenger bar at cost price – Hfl20 (about £5) – and snatched a few hours’ sleep in my cabin.In Rotterdam, 90 minutes or so north by train, the mood was positive but not overconfident as the Everton numbers built up steadily from mid-morning. In mid-afternoon a semi-serious game of football broke out between fans and the shirt-sleeved city police in one of the squares, handcuffs still hanging from their belts, and when I got to De Kuip – then a wonderful two-deck, open-topped steel stadium with a seated main stand on the fourth side – my match ticket could not have been better.I was on the top deck behind the goal at the Everton end and, after a first half of few chances and a good goal by Andy Gray disallowed for offside, things livened up on 58 minutes when Gray stabbed in a volley after good work from Graeme Sharp. Fifteen minutes later Trevor Steven scored from close range at the back post after a corner and that seemed to be that. But then came the worrying bit.There were only two Rapid players I was aware of but one was Hans Krankl, the Austria striker who had a great World Cup in 1978, and the other was Czech great Antonin Panenka, and he came on at 1-0. And with five minutes to go, a defensive error saw an offside-looking Krankl get free and score low past Neville Southall, the majority of the 38,000-plus crowd immediately fearing the worst.This was a different Everton to what we had become accustomed to in the 1970s, however, and Sheedy – set up by Sharp – made it three within a minute and the team played out a 3-1 win with confidence.Kevin Ratcliffe was handed our first European trophy and, after 10 minutes of the players celebrating with the cup it was back to Liverpool andor off to Wembley for most of our number, and back to Rotterdam for the rest, as the party continued long into the night.My next serious memory was being woken up after sunrise by a mate who spotted me among 100 or so bodies crashed out in front of the ticket office at Rotterdam station, awaiting the first trains out. What a day and what a game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important.

Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear).

However, the government lockdown meant that the seller was unable to move because the removal company cancelled the job.We agreed to delay the completion date to 24 April. But the seller is now saying they cannot move on then either as, at 70 years old, they are in the high-risk category for Covid-19.My flat is being sold, we have a buyer and they are ready to exchange contracts to tie in with the purchase of the house, so we do not have to pay the additional stamp duty. My husband works in the hospitality industry. His company is not generating an income and he is at risk of losing his job. We can afford the mortgage repayments on one salary, but on just my salary we would have difficulty getting a new mortgage for the house we have exchanged on.We have no idea how long the lockdown will last and we don’t want to lose the buyer for our flat. We also want to limit our financial liabilities in relation to the exchange contract for the house we are buying.Should we serve notice to complete on the 70-year-old seller? Are we better off forcing a move, or rescinding the contract after the notice period if the seller does not want to move? EAA It’s too soon to serve a notice to complete as your sellers have not yet failed to do so by the new date of 24 April that you have agreed with them. But if they don’t complete on that date, you can get your solicitor to serve a notice to complete on your seller’s solicitor. This sets a new date – typically 10 days after the day the notice is served – for completion to take place. Either party’s failure to complete by the new date entitles the other to terminate the contract and claim damages. However, if the new date of 24 April was an informal agreement, and so didn’t follow the legal process for moving completion dates and amending contracts, because your sellers failed to complete on the original 27 March completion date, you can serve a notice to complete as soon as you like.Whether you should is another matter. According to Abby Campbell of Davisons solicitors, “in order for a notice to complete to be valid, it is crucial that the serving party is ready willing and able” to complete by the date given in the notice. So if you are relying on the proceeds from the sale of your flat to complete your house purchase, serving a notice to complete would be inadvisable. But if you genuinely are “ready, willing and able” to complete by the date given in any notice you serve, it will mean that if the seller fails to complete, you will be able to rescind the contract and get back – with interest - the deposit you paid when contracts were exchanged. What you can’t do is force your sellers to move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e28657077fb0706a45afeb983144e0a2d0e461bd/2495_1194_1603_962/master/1603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ad7fa1e15fcad90b432948bd047a180","title":"together at home review locked down stars lift the spirits","story":"There are stirring performances aplenty in the Lady Gaga-hosted singathon, but it’s the glimpses of celebs’ homes that are the real treatWith Together at Home, Lady Gaga brought together music stars from around the world to give everyone something they so desperately need at this time of acute crisis: a chance to judge the interior design choices of the rich and famous.As you watch this compilation of live performances recorded in stars’ homes while they, like everyone else, self-isolate due to coronavirus, it’s a bit like going round a house with an estate agent: you’re pretending to listen to what they’re saying, but you’re actually trying to check out their bookshelves and thinking, my God, those kitchen units are ineawful.Lady Gaga’s home performance space is full of chaotic energy, featuring gold dumbbells and a suitcase pasted with sheet music. On the plus side, Mick Jagger’s taste in floral curtains is rather chic, and John Legend’s house has the desert-modernism aesthetic down pat. In an act of elite-level passive aggression, Elton John has plonked a piano in the middle of his outdoor basketball court, presumably to stop his kids driving him mad during lockdown with endless attempts at three-pointers.All this ogling is not really in the spirit of the event, which is a deeply earnest appreciation from the stars for essential workers, their performances interspersed with coverage of the fight against the virus, and shows of support from Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama and others.It begins with six hours of online livestreamed performances along with calls to donate to the WHO’s Solidarity Response Fund, before the star wattage intensifies for the TV broadcast and the tone changes. “Put your wallets away,” Gaga says. “It’s our love letter to the world – the incredible artists we’ve got lined up for you, they’re all here to say thank-you, to celebrate you, to give back a little bit of kindness that you’ve given to us.” For the UK, there’s a tweaked version of the package, featuring a higher proportion of Brits including Paul McCartney and Tom Jones, plus social media montages of stars including the athletes Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill. There is of course a rather luvvie-ish tendency on show here, that the world will be soothed with the ine gift of song the weariest health workers watching might have preferred a donation of funds for PPE rather than pop power couple Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello thinking to themselves what a wonderful world it is, no matter how gorgeous and gorgeously harmonised they are.But these performances are often beautiful and display rare gifts. Stevie Wonder’s medley of Bill Withers’ Lean on Me with his own Love’s in Need of Love Today is a robust double-helix of solidarity. The Rolling Stones’ rendition of You Can’t Always Get What You Want is superbly intimate, Jagger’s big-hearted vocals juxtaposing perfectly with Keith Richards’ Tom Waits-esque murmurs: stoicism and caution in a brotherly duet. Jennifer Lopez isn’t generally thought of as a balladeer, but her performance of Barbra Streisand’s People is Broadway-powerful, and its subject matter – humility in crisis – makes it perfectly chosen. Elton’s performance of I’m Still Standing is less good, delivered in the clipped “club style” of Shooting Stars.Among the new generation, Billie Eilish is typically spellbinding. She picks out Sunny by Bobby Hebb, an infectiously joyful tune, but while the lyrics face forward into brightness and joy, the way Eilish performs it – using her sensual, high-frequency vibrato – acknowledges the pain that came before. Burna Boy’s song African Giant – “Tell em Africa we done dying” – deftly rebuts the narrative of desperate African strife that has dominated all-star benefit shows in the past, and Taylor Swift’s moving performance of Soon You’ll Get Better, originally written for her unwell mother, will no doubt have powerfully resonated with those whose family members are currently stricken. The line “This won’t go back to normal, if it ever was”, takes on a quiet political edge, too.The BBC’s package of the material slots it into a shiny-floor studio format ably presented by Clara Amfo, Claudia Winkleman and Dermot O’Leary, the latter dressed to audition for a porn parody of the Steve Jobs documentary. The music takes a more soundtracking role with plenty of heartwarming montages of British health workers, bin men and more. There’s also a wonderful sequence where Skip Marley plays his grandfather Bob’s I Wanna Love You as a surprise first dance song for an NHS nurse who had her wedding cancelled because of the crisis – Richard E Grant plays best man, with Nadiya Hussain as cake provider.Paul McCartney’s Lady Madonna is jazzily interpreted almost to the point of incoherence, but he and Tom Jones give evocative personal tributes to the NHS, with Jones remembering his own isolation at the hands of tuberculosis as a child. Michael Bublé – whose young son was treated for cancer in 2016 – delivers a rightly sentimental take on God Only Knows for health workers, but it’s Little Mix who are the best of the Beeb exclusives with a perfectly harmonised version of Touch. Their melancholic take on a track that’s about being ragingly horny hints at a painful side of self-isolation that only a pop song could address in this family-friendly format. K-pop super-boyband SuperM are charming, indulging in lockdown pursuits like exercising, drawing, building a model ship and cooking some rubbish-looking bruschetta as they sing the comment feed duly explodes into heart emojis. But it’s Italian star Zucchero who steals the show, covering Everybody’s Gotta Learn Sometimes on piano. The Korgis’ song is about the loss of innocence at realising the sheer power of love, but in this context is charged with something even deeper: the pain of grief and the inevitability of death.Although it’s celebrating the work of the WHO, no one comes out to denounce Donald Trump’s defunding of the organisation Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder edited out the government-bashing lyrics in his otherwise extremely powerful rendition of River Cross. Perhaps there is reticence to be seen to be politicising the crisis, despite it being so profoundly political. A cynical reading is that these performances are merely good PR, which of course they are a more pointed criticism might be that for all the talk of it bringing people together, music is actually quite impotent in the face of such a devastating disease, and that awareness hardly needed to be raised about it. The situation is so grave for some that art will seem facile, even indulgent.But Gaga et al’s intentions are ultimately noble, the performers are sincere, and their song choices channel poignancy, acknowledge tenacity and invite self-reflection. They also, meanwhile, show that the chief interior lighting choice for celebrities is the soulful application of candles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e95cc42d89533e701259c04757ed2c2f54cd36/0_1160_4048_2428/master/4048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c30fcf19dc384361f7516ef9ed5048e","title":"nina simone where to start in her back catalogue","story":"Our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the deft genius who raged searingly at injusticeNina Simone in Concert (1964)Nina Simone is in the unusual position of being a towering genius who never recorded an undeniable, canonical masterpiece. If you choose your 10 favourite songs, there’s a good chance that they’ll be from 10 different albums, which makes one of the many excellent compilations the natural gateway into a vast body of work that encompasses jazz, blues, folk, soul, pop, rock, show tunes, polyrhythms and songs that don’t even have genres.That said, In Concert, recorded at three Carnegie Hall shows during March and April 1964, represents her great leap forward as both a performer and activist: her escape from the “nothing world” of pop. She performs three songs from her jazzy 1959 debut Little Girl Blue with a newfound depth, drawn from painful personal experience and her recent political awakening at the hands of new friends in the civil rights movement, notably Lorraine Hansberry and James Baldwin. It’s this nightcrawling version of Jack Hammer’s Plain Gold Ring that explains why Nick Cave later covered it, while Don’t Smoke in Bed is so stark that you can hear audience members shifting in their seats.Unlike most live albums, In Concert leaves the audience in the mix throughout and illustrates how deftly Simone could snap between tension and release. Summoning the vengeful ghost of Brecht and Weill’s Pirate Jenny into the age of Medgar Evers and George Wallace, she stuns the room into a silence punctuated only by nervous coughs. During Go Limp, a kind of protester’s sex comedy written by CND campaigner Alex “The Joy of Sex” Comfort, the spectators chortle at the jokes, join in the goofy chorus and keep Simone airborne when she forgets the lyrics. The laughter carries into her own Mississippi Goddam – written in a frenzy hours after the 1963 Alabama church bombing – until the show-tune irony is burned away by a mounting rage that consumes the hall and you can hear in real time the realisation that they are listening to a protest song like none they’ve ever heard, owing more to cabaret than folk, and more to Malcolm X than Martin Luther King. Simone is fully aware of the power she wields: “Betcha thought I was kidding, didn’t you?” The final standing ovation is an explosion of awe and relief. Oh, to have been in that room.Wild Is the Wind (1966)Starting with I Put a Spell on You in 1965, you can’t go wrong with Simone’s final five albums for Philips Records. Despite being largely pieced together from leftover sessions by producer Hal Mooney, Wild Is the Wind is the strongest illustration of her uncanny ability to find the song within a song, revealing the secret tunnels and caverns that previous singers didn’t know existed and future interpreters couldn’t ignore. When Jeff Buckley covered the gloomy torch song Lilac Wine, he was really covering Simone’s version, which also happens to be one of Thom Yorke’s Desert Island Discs. Likewise, it was Simone who showed David Bowie that Johnny Mathis’s Wild is the Wind could be a shattering tour de force. Simone’s own Four Women, a quadripartite study of black womanhood so unflinching in its pain and outrage that some black radio stations banned it, epitomises her talent for inhabiting characters with her voice. It is practically a seance: each mistreated woman is sketched in just a few short lines but she lives and breathes and cries out for justice.Nina Simone and Piano! (1969)One of Simone’s 1969 albums for RCA was To Love Somebody, a pop-minded collection of handsomely arranged covers of Dylan, Cohen and the Bee Gees. The other was its polar opposite: Simone alone with the instrument she learned as a child. Her most intimate and auteurish album (she handled the occasional embellishments and overdubs as well) weaves erse material into a coherent suite of songs haunted by loneliness, depression and mortality. She makes Randy Newman’s I Think It’s Going to Rain Today bleaker still (“I hope it’s gonna rain today”), delivers Jacques Brel’s The Desperate Ones in a fraught whisper, rewrites the blues standard Nobody’s Fault But Mine and even renders Jonathan King’s mawkish Everyone’s Gone to the Moon unnervingly strange. Never has an exclamation mark been more inappropriate. This is a companion for the wee small hours.Around this time, Maya Angelou called Simone “an extremist, extremely realised”. Her last heavyweight artistic statement began at a show near Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Jane Fonda’s anti-war Free the Army tour in November 1971. George Harrison’s My Sweet Lord is a warm breeze but she whips it into a gospel hurricane and merges it with the Last Poets’ David Nelson’s biting poem Today Is a Killer, so that hope battles with despair on a cosmic scale. Running to almost 19 minutes, the medley is the most staggering spiritual crisis you will ever hear, whipped towards a chilling climax that brings the two strands together: “Today, who are you Lord? You are a killer!” Not yet done with Harrison, she spins Isn’t It a Pity out over 11 stark, disillusioned minutes, like a last call for humanity. “The times are desperate and America is one big emergency ward with everybody in the hospital,” Simone explained, not long before leaving “the United Snakes of America” for good.What might Simone have achieved in the 1970s had she not been derailed by deteriorating mental health, tax problems and self-imposed exile? Her fascination with West African polyrhythms was cut short but this radical interpretation of a Tina Turner song gives you a taste. Barely more than a sly, taunting vocal and feverish percussion, it signposts a road not taken.A Raised Voice by Claudia Roth PierpontPrompted by the controversial biopic Nina, this superb 2014 New Yorker article focuses on Simone’s role in the civil rights movement and the roots of her rage. “As the 60s progressed, the feelings she displayed – pain, lacerating anger, the desire to burn down whole cities in revenge – made her seem at times emotionally disturbed and at other times simply the most honest black woman in America.”What Happened, Miss Simone?Fortuitously released during the rise of Black Lives Matter, Liz Garbus’ taut 2015 Netflix documentary puts Simone’s radicalism into context. The talking heads are so-so but the archive footage is unmissable.Princess Noire: The Tumultuous Reign of Nina Simone by Nadine CohodasSimone’s slim 1991 memoir I Put a Spell on You left out a great deal. The best of the biographies fills in the gaps. Cohodas is particularly good at explaining what plagued Simone during her turbulent final decades, when her foes often included her own audiences.

Songs were interspersed with messages from actors such as Matthew McConaughey and Lupita Nyong’o, as well as other figures including Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.While the two-hour television broadcast portion – also screened by the BBC in the UK with additional performances from Paul McCartney, Tom Jones and more – was framed as a gift to essential workers, the preceding six hours invited donations, with the bulk of the cash coming from corporate sponsors. The WHO’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund will get $55.1m, while $72.8m will go to charities such as food banks and housing providers. The WHO fund is used to allocate tests and treatment, and to support development of a vaccine.Inevitably, the fundraising took on a political tinge, coming shortly after Donald Trump withdrew US funding for the WHO. Speaking to Variety, Hugh Evans, chief executive of Global Citizen, said: “It is not uncommon for world leaders of all stature to try to point fingers, because politics is in some instances about survival. And so I think that it’s not so surprising that it has become a political football. But I think that what we have to remember is that there’s no second World Health Organisation. There’s only one.”The show was well received, with Piers Morgan, who had previously criticised Lady Gaga’s involvement, apologising to her for his earlier comments. “This was a great initiative that raised a fortune, entertained people, \u0026amp will help save lives,” he tweeted. “It was also a perfect illustration of a major star using their profile properly in this crisis. Congrats \u0026amp sorry for originally questioning it.”Lady Gaga tweeted after the show: “Thank you with all of my heart for watching #TogetherAtHome, sharing in a global moment of kindness with each other, and spreading positive and loving intentions. We love you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70cebea50acc9ab82989ca1caa26922d91b3f8f/0_43_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f76940d538c58892a04e7fac367e28d","title":"the best in culture under coronavirus lockdown podcast","story":"Three  critics – Ammar Kalia, Laura Snapes and Sian Cain – join Rachel Humphreys with a guide to the best of television, music and books under lockdown.

The party, iniduals and some media commentators are all said to be the subject of legal complaints as a result of the document’s release and remarks made about its contents.The row caused by the 860-page document has been a huge blow to Keir Starmer’s hopes of uniting Labour under his leadership following years of infighting. It claimed that factional hostility towards Jeremy Corbyn contributed to the party’s ineffective handling of antisemitism complaints and undermined its 2017 election campaign. It also included criticisms of the party and some of its leading figures by staff members in private messages.Since it emerged last weekend, some of those mentioned in the document have contacted lawyers, with each person said to be considering several different claims. It exposes Labour to a potentially huge bill should it lose in court or opt to settle.John McDonnell, Labour’s former shadow chancellor, has said the report was commissioned by general secretary Jennie Formby and put together by the party’s governance and legal unit. It was due to be submitted to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism in the party, but that move was blocked by Labour’s lawyers.Mark Lewis, a lawyer who has been contacted by those seeking legal action, told the Observer: “There are lots and lots of claims. There are claims under the Data Protection Act, there are claims for breach of confidence or invasion of privacy and there are claims for libel. It is a very lengthy report that mentions a lot of people. I’ve been contacted by 15 people. Each one of them could well have several claims. What is going on is phenomenal. It’s a bit like the soldiers leaving a barracks that they have to desert and setting it on fire.“For four years, people in Labour have said there is no antisemitism in the party, it’s just a smear. Now they say that of course there was antisemitism, ‘but it just wasn’t us’. They have not noticed the absurdity of their change of position. There are actions against the party, actions against iniduals, actions against commentators. People need to be careful about statements that have been made. If this bankrupts the Labour party or iniduals, so be it. Actions have consequences.”One of those considering legal action, who asked not to be named, said: “Several of us are already in detailed conversations with a number of legal teams. The Labour party had made serious allegations about our behaviour. These allegations were never put to us and not a single one of us did anything other than to work towards the best possible result in the 2017 election. Many of us are now being subjected to horrendous online abuse directly as a consequence.”Formby has told party staff that the inquiry into the report, ordered by Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner, will examine how it was commissioned, the culture it reveals and who leaked it. Local party branches have been ordered not to share it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62e042fe34bebd0a7a50a15ad0a9057fecbc5e38/0_50_599_359/master/599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d8c79c8ae5a1c62eefb1f87ad3d589","title":"can you solve it john horton conway playful maths genius","story":"Two gems from the wizard of recreational mathsToday’s column is a celebration of John Horton Conway, the legendary British mathematician, who died of coronavirus earlier this month, aged 82.Conway was an inspirational, iconoclastic genius who invented and studied countless puzzles and games, in addition to his more highbrow work in group theory, number theory, geometry, topology and many other fields.Born in Liverpool and educated at Cambridge he had been a professor at Princeton university since 1987. (To read more about his larger-than-life personality and his mathematical legacy, Conway was the subject of a brilliant  long read in 2015. It was titled: ‘the world’s most charismatic mathematician.’)Conway was always a font of brilliant puzzles. A few years ago I asked him if he had any suggestions for this column. He told me the two below. They are not of his own invention, but they perfectly reflect his sense of fun.I had a window in the north wall of my house. It was a perfect square, 1 metre wide and 1 metre high But this window never let in enough light. So I hired this firm, the Miracle Builders, who performed the impossible. They remodeled the window so it let in more light. When when they’d finished the window was a perfect square, 1 metre high and 1 metre wide.How did they do it?I have a ten digit number, abcdefghij. Each of the digits is different, andWhat’s my number?I first met Conway a decade ago at a recreational maths conference in Atlanta. He was gathering pinecones and counting their spirals. The number of spirals on a pinecone is usually a Fibonacci number, but sometimes is a Lucas number. Conway was trying to find the ratio between Fibonacci and Lucas pinecones. He was easily the most distinguished mathematician in the group, yet he was also the most joyful, sharing his indefatigable, childlike curiosity about mathematical patterns with anyone who approached him.Conway’s most famous invention was the Game of Life, a two-dimensional clockwork universe that modelled evolution and was one of the earliest computer crazes. He was always frustrated, however, that it was what he was best known for, claiming he was prouder, for example, of inventing surreal numbers.If you ever met Conway or have been inspired by his work, please share your memories below the line.Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS for the puzzles. I’ll be back at 5pm UK time with the solutions. (And I’ll post some hints around lunch time in the comments below.)I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

The Gambling Commission’s guidelines state that firms should be wary of accepting funds from anyone who has recently received a “windfall”.A spokesperson from the Gambling Commission said: “While we can’t comment on inidual cases, we are absolutely committed to reducing gambling harms and we expect operators to step in and prevent harm when a customer’s behaviour indicates they are at risk. Given repeated failings with ‘VIP’ practices in the industry, we will also shortly be consulting on additional requirements in this area.”When Matt deposited £8,000, the VIP manager phoned to ask for reassurance that he could afford the bets, noting they were “a large chunk of your annual salary”.But he appeared to accept Matt’s verbal assurance that he had other work, and he dished out more free bets in return.“The thing is, we don’t even want to do it but we have to do it because the UK gambling regulators make us do it.“As a thank you for clearing that up, there’s a £100 free bet for you. I hate being intrusive but I’ll always reward you if you give me proper answers.”A few days later, the VIP manager asked Matt to write a review of MansionBet on Trustpilot, a website that consumers visit to see reviews of brands.Matt was rewarded with another free bet after saying he had left a “rave review”.Transcripts of WhatsApp conversations show that the VIP manager also offered Matt incentives to deposit more money, saying: “If you deposit a further £3,000, I would give you £500 in free bets.”After handing out one bonus, he said: “I hope that’s lucky for you,” but he later admitted: “I tend to give bigger bonuses when you lose.”Matt, whose name has been changed at his request, said: “MansionBet knew I had been made redundant and could see my funds deteriorating every day and yet still allowed me to deposit sickening amounts of money.”The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: “This is not only exploitative but cruel, predatory and cynical. These cases grow in severity, yet the industry still protest that they behave responsibly. The time for radical change is now.”MansionBet, which has won recognition among British gamblers thanks to sponsorship deals with football teams including Tottenham Hotspur and AFC Bournemouth, said it had refused a request from Matt to refund money deposited in his sports betting account.“This case has been reviewed thoroughly by senior management due to the extensive nature of the contacts by the customer, and we are satisfied all conclusions drawn are in line with our regulatory requirements,” said a spokesperson.“MansionBet disagrees with the characterisations of the incidents in question, as put forward by you in your questions.”The Gambling Commission is considering whether to ban VIP schemes, which have been linked to a string of cases in which firms failed to protect vulnerable addicts.The regulator, which has come under fire over its effectiveness, has commissioned a review of VIP schemes led by GVC, which itself has been criticised over VIP schemes run by its Ladbrokes business.In an interim report, the review suggested new restrictions such as barring under-25s from VIP schemes and enhanced checks before customers can join the schemes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ad10bdb93d9137ae4b9c95c823749fbd91f7ef/0_140_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b633a61fb09ab5a73e8440a37c475096","title":"labour urges universal credit rethink to help low income families coronavirus lockdown","story":"Call for five-week payment wait to be scrapped to protect families hit by coronavirus lockdownThe Labour party has called for major changes to universal credit to ensure low-income families hit by the coronavirus lockdown receive sufficient financial support throughout the crisis.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, called for the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment to be scrapped and replaced with a cash grant, and the two-child limit on benefit payments to be abandoned.He also called for the government to scrap rules that prevent anyone with savings of more than £16,000 from obtaining universal credit. He said: “For me the system should be viewed as a form of social insurance. It should be there when you need it. We wouldn’t limit the NHS to anyone who had savings of over £16,000.”Reynolds also called for recipients of legacy benefits, including employment and support allowance, to receive the same £20 a week uprating that was awarded last month to recipients of universal credit and tax credits.Universal credit has become a main focus of state financial support for many families since the lockdown, with more than 1.4 million people signing up for the benefit since mid-March, most having either lost their job or seen their self-employment opportunities shrink.More than 500,000 of the new claimants had taken up advance loans to see them through the five-week wait for the first payment and would have to soon start repaying this sum. Reynolds said these loans – which would be repaid over two years – should be “recoded as a grant and written off”.Reynolds paid tribute to frontline DWP staff for delivering unprecedented numbers of new claims in recent weeks. But he said that more had to be done to ensure the benefit system was able to support low-income families struggling with the additional costs of lockdown, including food and energy.Reynolds said that under the new Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, the focus of the party’s welfare policy would be on driving down child poverty. “It’s going to be a big focus. We will want to go into an election with a serious plan for how we will reduce child poverty.”He said Labour wanted to replace universal credit with a more trusted and “less punitive” system, although he was “not talking about a new IT system”. Part of the problem with universal credit was it was viewed with fear and suspicion by potential claimants. “The brand is too damaged,” he said.Reynolds, the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, said he wanted changes to the disability benefits system, of which he had personal experience through his son Jack, 17, who has autism. “At the minute it is clear that the voices of people who go though the disability benefits assessment process are not listened to by the government,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/279aa14411720a308d8a151ba8bab61106879cb6/0_322_5282_3171/master/5282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de3652c811e2afac279103ce9fcc67db","title":"novak djokovic coronavirus covid 19 vaccination tennis","story":"Novak Djokovic says his opposition to vaccinations may get in the way of his return to competitive tennis.“Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” the world No 1 said in a live Facebook chat with several fellow Serbian athletes on Sunday. “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.“Hypothetically, if the season was to resume in July, August or September, though unlikely, I understand that a vaccine will become a requirement straight after we are out of strict quarantine and there is no vaccine yet.”Last month, former world No1 Amelie Mauresmo said the rest of the 2020 tennis season may be wiped out. She added that action should not resume until a vaccine is available for Covid-19, something that most scientists believe is at least a year away.“International circuit  players of all nationalities plus management, spectators and people from the 4 corners of the world who bring these events to life. No vaccine  no tennis,” the two-time grand slam winner said in a widely shared tweet.This year’s Wimbledon championships have been cancelled for the first time since the second world war, while the French Open, originally due to start on 24 May, was rescheduled for the end of September, shortly after the end of the US Open.Djokovic made a flying start to the 2020 season, winning the Australian Open in January for his 17th grand slam title and stretched his winning run to 18 matches before the pandemic brought sports events across the world to a halt.So far the governing bodies of tennis have suspended all tournaments until 13 July. In addition, the women’s Rogers Cup in Montreal, which had been due to be held in August, will not take place this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043f1f7dcb7c0cdbcaff7dd04684d5a41525231b/0_4_3392_2035/master/3392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e6821e668bacdc7d1cfb267a30afe9","title":"tennis owes debt players cost lockdown coronavirus","story":"Lower-ranked professionals were living off scraps even before the pandemic but now their plight may finally be recognisedAt the exact moment the International Tennis Federation announced the immediate cancellation of all events in March, Panna Udvardy was deep in battle, breaking serve at a lowly ITF World Tennis Tour event in Olímpia, Brazil. While the sport’s commentariat descended into a collective state of shock, Udvardy was pumping her fist and peering towards her coach. She quickly realised he was not staring back.“I looked at my coach and he was talking to the supervisor. I was like: ‘Come on, why are you talking to him? Watch the match!’ And then I won, I played like three hours, I came off court. My coach told me that at 3-1 the supervisor had talked to him and cancelled the tournament.”What happened next was a reflection of tennis’s great weakness. Udvardy, a 21-year-old Hungarian ranked 347 by the WTA, had spent thousands of dollars to fly herself and her coach to Olímpia with the goal of minimising costs by entering a series of tournaments in Brazil. While hundreds of players at Indian Wells, the fifth biggest tournament in the world, were offered first-round prize money to cover costs after its cancellation, she was forced to immediately purchase two tickets out of Brazil that she could not afford.The faulty financial model of tennis has long been problematic as prize money has disproportionately risen at the top over the past decades, but the coronavirus pandemic is a transformative moment that requires a sweeping response. Tennis players are private contractors who earn money only when they compete, or if they are lucky enough to encounter sponsorships. Now they earn nothing.For Udvardy, the $4,000 (£3,150) she made before taxes in the first three months of this year was supplemented with sporadic coaching and small sponsorships from helpful companies. Those companies are now at risk and social distancing regulations forbid her from coaching.“I’m not sure what I’m going to do if it’s going to be much longer,” she says. “There’s no way I can do anything else. I can’t even go away and give lessons. It’s just really hard. I think everyone is in the same situation as I am and we all need help from the ITF and WTA.”In the same breath, she is quick to point out that her situation is better than most. She has received some assistance from the Hungarian federation and she is young – her desperation to fulfil her potential means that, no matter where she is financially whenever normality resumes, she will return to the foot of the mountain to climb again if she must. Instead, she is more concerned about those who may be pushed out of the sport for good.Although Greece possesses more top-20 players than Great Britain and France combined, Grammatikopoulou, ranked 297, has not received a penny of support. Greece’s national federation is insignificant and she does not qualify for government financial help. For the first time in a decade she has returned to her small hometown of Axioupoli for more than just a couple of weeks. Her father sells curtains and pillows in the local market and the family is living off his government furlough.By all indications, tennis’s stakeholders are finally appropriately recognising their forgotten classes. After hours of discussions with his fellow members Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the ATP player council president, Novak Djokovic, last week sent an email to players detailing his proposed relief fund for those ranked between 250 and 700.The fund would include a sliding scale of contributions from top-100 players based on ranking groups, ranging from $30,000 contributed by top-five players to $5,000 by those ranked between 50 and 100. Along with $500,000 contributions from grand slam tournaments and money sourced from future events, the hope is for a pot of between $4m and $4.5m, with $10k for each player. The WTA is said to be in similar discussions on behalf of its players.The proposal requires the votes of Djokovic’s fellow players, some of whom may have qualms about contributing a far greater percentage of their earnings than the top players. Regardless, it represents an unprecedented period in the history of the sport, which was underlined by Djokovic’s comments during his recent Instagram live chat with Stan Wawrinka.

Not that the phone is that small. It has a gorgeous 6.55in FHD+ AMOLED screen that is big by most standards, it is just not as massive as the super-sized variety. It runs at a 90Hz refresh rate too, which continues to be an excellent enhancement making all scrolling and animations a lot smoother than the previous 60Hz standard.A selfie camera peers through a hole in the screen in the top left corner. The rest of the device is the usual metal and glass sandwich with curved sides. It has a central triple-camera lump in the back, OnePlus’s excellent alert slider, power and volume buttons in the sides, and a USB-C port in the bottom, but no headphone socket.At 72.9mm wide the OnePlus 8 is one of the narrowest large-screen smartphones available, which with its relatively light 180g weight, makes it significantly easier to handle. For comparison, the OnePlus 7T is 1.5mm wider, Google’s Pixel 4XL is 2.2mm wider, Samsung’s Galaxy S20+ is 0.8mm wider and Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.9mm wider.At 160.2mm long and 8mm thick the OnePlus will fit in a pocket fairly easily. A good clear plastic case is included in the box, while a screen protector comes pre-applied.The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are some of the first smartphones released in Europe to feature Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 processor, available with 8 or 12GB of RAM depending on storage version. It is 5G-capable by default and supports two sim cards at once.Performance all-round was nothing short of fantastic. OnePlus has made a name for itself with some of the fastest-feeling smartphones, and the 8 is no exception. Snappy, fluid, with no hint of lag or latency. It’s simply more responsive than anything else. Gaming performance was top notch too.Top performance is backed by solid battery life. The OnePlus 8 lasts more than 32 hours between charges, which is longer than its predecessor, making it from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two - enough for even the busiest of days.That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the screen set to 90Hz and on for well over five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, 50 minutes of video, plus seven hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos.One caveat: it was impossible to test the effects of 5G on battery life during lockdown in the UK as I do not currently receive coverage at home. 5G performance on Vodafone and EE, however, was similar to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra when tested during a grocery run. It’s worth noting that, pending a software update, the phone is limited to 4G-only when two sims are used at the same time.The 8 ships with OxygenOS 10.5 based on Android 10, which continues to be one of the best implementations of Android available on any device.New for this year is the addition of Google’s Discover feed on the home screen, replacing the less-than-loved “Shelf” alternative. Other nice touches include the ability to choose which icons show in the status bar, full theme support, including a dark-mode theme, choices for animations such as that around the fingerprint scanner and the ability to trigger Google Assistant by pressing and holding the power button.Overall OxygenOS continues to provide plenty of customisation and power-user features without clutter or slowdown.OnePlus offers software support for at least three years from release, including two years of Android version updates and then a further year of security updates on a bi-monthly schedule. Updates to new versions of Android are fairly fast post-release by Google too.The OnePlus 8 has a triple-camera system on the rear of the device, combining a 48-megapixel main camera, a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 5-megapixel macro camera.The main 48MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default, producing some great-looking images in good lighting, while the auto-HDR mode handles high-contrast scenes well. It stumbles a bit in middling conditions, such indoor lighting, losing detail in textures and struggling with white balance. Low-light performance is not fantastic, although OnePlus’s Nightscape mode helps. A 48MP mode is also available, but I generally got better results without it.There’s no telephoto camera, which is a shame, instead a 2x zoom button in the camera app is a digital zoom, which works pretty well at low magnifications, but is full of artefacts anywhere approaching its 10x max.The 16MP ultrawide angle camera is fun and does a good job of capturing a wide scene, but was a little bleached and soft on detail in bright light, handling better in less sunny scenes and indoors during the day.The 5MP macro camera is garbage. I take quite a lot of macro photography and got much better results using the main camera, which can focus fairly close to the lens, and then zooming in a little bit.The front-facing 16MP camera is fixed-focus but is really good, producing highly detailed and well toned skin in images in good light. It gets slightly softer in poor light, but still very respectable.The OnePlus 8 is a great phone at a good price, particularly when you consider you’re getting 5G flagship performance at £599, which undercuts rivals such as Samsung’s Galaxy S20 by about £300.You get a smartphone experience that’s second to none. Always fast, always fluid and with a level of software refinement few others manage. The 6.55in 90Hz screen is bright and slick, while the narrow width and relatively light weight make the OnePlus 8 one of the easiest big-screen phones to use on a day-to-day basis.The battery outlasts even the most intense days, while it charges super fast and has modes to help increase battery longevity. The main camera is good for the money too.Corners have been cut to reach the mid-range price, including a telephoto camera and wireless charging. While three years of software support might be fairly standard for Android devices, Samsung offers four and Apple offers at least five, so there’s still work to be done.Overall the OnePlus 8 offers a lot of phone for the money in a manageable size, making it the very best lower-cost 5G device released so far.Cons: no headphone socket, no telephoto camera, 5G disabled when using two sims, no formal IP rating, only three years software updates This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I plan to walk past sacks of spices and dyes, piles of green mint as high as a door lintel, and sweet fried bouchnikhas, and find a place to stand with my back against the wall, out of the way of bicycles and the madly confident teenagers on scooters, and watch hundreds of people go by.I have always been in awe of the way the scooters don’t collide (or at least, don’t collide much): I want to see seas of people – tourists and merchants and children – dodge each other and step on each other’s toes, and laugh it off and surge on. I plan to admire the many different shades of people’s eyes, and the varieties of teeth, and the unassailable beauty of the human body in motion. I hope to find the collective of women selling argan oil scented with orange blossom, and buy five bottles, and to go about for weeks smelling of a greenhouse. My home during isolation has no heating, so I I dream of large skies and of the ferocity of the sun.Fifteen miles from Marrakech is a Berber village, and on the outskirts is a riad called Tigmi, a hotel at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The walls are built of rough, uneven stone, the bathrooms are plastered in cool tadelakt, and there is bougainvillea everywhere. There are goats which pass by and occasionally lick the front door handle in search of salt. Best of all, there are dozens of tortoises in the garden, which butt their heads hopefully against your feet at breakfast, and chew lightly at your hair if you lie on the grass.I envy those goats and tortoises. I miss the days when I could have licked the door handles with relative bacterial if not social impunity. Why did I not lick door handles all day long while I could? I wish I had known what I had while I had it: I would have chewed lightly on strangers’ eyebrows on the Northern Line. I always thought I was good at cherishing the luck I have had - it turns out I was not cherishing hard enough.

He has an ageing crooner’s slicked-back hair, the short-sleeved cool of a Miami Beach architect, and a terrible, terrible Lada car.He’s my go-to chofer in Havana, which sounds a little grand, but it’s more economical than buying one of these babies, which will set you back £15,000. It’s also why, despite the windows having no handles (a wrench is passed back) and the rear seat containing a loose spring like an unkind proctologist, Landy fusses over it like a baby.For this little blue car completes his look. On this island better known for its American incredible hulks, it marks him out as a member of the Ladaocracia, Cuba’s revolutionary Lada aristocracy.It’s 50 years to the day since the first Lada ran off the production line in Tolyatti, a Russian company town – also known as Togliatti – on a bend in the Volga. That means it’s also three days until the 150th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, whose centenary that moment celebrated.A collaboration between the Soviet state and Italy’s Fiat, the Lada was the vision of designers who set out to make these small cars virtually indestructible. The result was the Zhiguli, a bulked-up Fiat 124, that even poets have struggled to describe as anything other than “boxy”.The body was toughened, drum brakes installed and clearance was heightened, all to help with the Russian roads and winters. More crucially, the car – renamed for the world as the Lada – was easy to maintain. The “classic” Lada became one of history’s most manufactured vehicles, with around 18 million built.In the 1970s, Soviet support for Cuba was at its height. “The government gave Ladas to doctors, people working on the sugar farms, athletes, engineers, scientists,” says Hendy Cobas, of Cuba’s Club Amigos del Motor, which has 1,000 members.This set the owners apart from those with the leftover Chevy Bel Airs and Ford Fairlanes from before the 1959 revolution. A friend recalls going to nightclubs and seeing the smarter set beginning to jump into Ladas at closing time: “You knew their parents or grandparents were someone important.”Willy Hierro Allen, the 77-year-old editor-in-chief of the magazine Excelencias del Motor, recalls: “In 1978, I was running Transporte magazine, and it seems someone thought I deserved it. The vice-minister called and told me ‘you are going to have a car’. I felt really excited. The car was blue. I still keep it the same colour.”Cuba’s extraordinary ability to soften and sentimentalise swiftly went to work on the utilitarian runaround. “Almost any Cuban can change the spark plugs, and most can swap the brake pads and fuel pumps,” says Cobas. “Ladas are members of the family.” It’s a sentence everyone here uses.“I’ve seen modifications to the bodywork, new air inlets or extensions to make it closer to the ground, but, apart from music systems, these are always small,” he goes on. “We don’t feel good about making big cuts on a Lada’s bodywork, it’s like you are cutting somebody.”It’s easy to understand why people look after them. The last classic Lada arrived in Cuba in 1988, but AutoCubana, Cuba’s version of Autotrader, lists models from 18,000 Cuban convertible pesos (CUC) – about £14,500. Good ones sell for twice that. It isn’t love, though it’s the dearth of other cars. For that money, Cubans can buy an apartment in one of the best areas of Havana.Following perestroika, Lada’s vast parent company, AvtoVAZ, went through the upheavals felt by many Soviet state industries. Production plummeted and corruption flourished. While the classic Lada continued to be built, the wheels were coming off. In the mid 1990s, there were 130,000 Ladas registered in the UK, By 2018 there were just 179. Countries were imposing carbon emission laws and the Lada couldn’t make the grade. Only in Cuba, with its estimated 250,000 Ladas, did the smoke refuse to clear.“Here, we are responsible for caring for our cars,” says Hierro, the editor of Excelencias del Motor. “When you grow old your son comes saying ‘Dad, let me fix the car’, then your son has a son too, and with time he is the one in charge of the car. That’s how the Lada ended up becoming the car of the Cuban family.”Sadly, as Landy and I head out to the highway, it may be the lingering smell of exhaust fumes that triggers my nostalgia. My first car was a Skoda, the Czech equivalent of the Lada. My dad bought it for me, saying – and I still hope he was joking – that he’d got it cheap because the previous owner had suffocated in it.There’s only so much I can take. I have a second go-to chofer. Jesus is a more austere figure than Landy. He rents a modern Lada from the state, one of 320 built under AvtoVAZ’s new owner, Renault, that arrived here in 2017. It is an entirely different creature and, in truth, it’s far better for long journeys. As Jesus says: “It’s comfortable and has a large trunk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/858becadc2ecc00c9384febb46418e15d9bbf274/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae7d12352281a1451e47f6a3e2bf1ad7","title":"coronavirus latest 20 april at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:There have now been more than 2.4m confirmed cases and 165,000 deaths from Covid-19 worldwide. The news came as US deaths passed 40,000 on Sunday – nearly a quarter of the global total – with infections at just under 760,000, or just under a third of the world’s total. The UK has more than 121,000 cases and 16,000 deaths.In a bad-tempered press briefing in which he clashed with several reporters, Donald Trump was accused of broadcasting in effect a “campaign ad” in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. He played selectively edited video clips just two days after Cuomo eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. Trump also criticised the restrictions put in place by some state leaders and again criticised the WHO and China over the pandemic but also said he was prepared to give Iran help to fight the virus. Domestically, he said a deal on aid for businesses was close to being agreed with the Democrats.The country’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has extended the country’s level-4 lockdown for a week, after which schools and daycare centres will be allowed to open, as well as some businesses barring major upsets. She warned New Zealanders to: “keep your bubble as small as possible – you can expand your bubble a small amount to include family members, vulnerable people or caregivers”. The country’s virus death toll stands at 12 and has introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the world, as it pursues and “elimination” strategy with the virus.The heads of all the UN’s major agencies have issued a graphic warning of the risk to the world’s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors had pledged around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response in March.Speaking about the likelihood of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead next year, Kentaro Iwata, a professor at Kobe University Hospital, said: “I don’t think the Olympics are likely to be held next year. People will be coming from hundreds of nations ... and although Japan might have the disease under control by next summer, I don’t think that will be the case everywhere.”Germany will take its first steps towards normality on Monday, with smaller shops in some regions opening up for the first time in a month after politicians declared the coronavirus “under control”. From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) will be allowed to welcome customers again, in a first wave of relaxations to strict curbs on public life introduced last month.Italy said on Sunday that deaths rose by 433, the lowest daily tally in a week, and the number of new cases slowed to 3,047 from a previous 3,491. The total number of deaths now stands at 23,660 – second only to the United States.President Hassan Rouhani announced on Sunday that the 100,000 detainees temporarily released to combat the spread of coronavirus would remain out of prison for another month, as the country works to halt the spread of the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many cases are there in my area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

She is rumoured to be the brains behind Kim’s carefully constructed public image, at home and abroad. In return, she enjoys the absolute confidence of her brother, a leader capable of ordering the execution of his own uncle for alleged treason.As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic – with Pyongyang continuing to insist it has not recorded a single case – Kim Yo-jong’s ascendancy continues.Last month, she made her first public statement, condemning the South as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North. And in March, she publicly praised Donald Trump for sending Kim a letter in which he said he hoped to maintain good bilateral relations and offered help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.The publication of political statements in Kim Yo-jong’s name underlines her central role in the regime, according to Youngshik Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone,” Bong said. “He is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.”But Yo-jong, who accompanied Kim to his two summits with Trump, apparently paid a price when his nuclear diplomacy suffered a setback. Last weekend, she was reinstated to the party’s powerful politburo, according to the state Korean Central News Agency, just over a year after she had reportedly been removed from the position and told to keep a low profile following the failure of the Hanoi denuclearisation summit.And she has not escaped the attention of US officials, who in 2017 placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for “severe human rights abuses”.Internationally, Yo-jong has been a visible presence throughout the regime’s high-stakes diplomatic process with Washington and Seoul. At home, she has performed the role of propagandist-in-chief, burnishing Kim’s reputation as head of the dynasty that has ruled North Korea for three generations.“She has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un,” said Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer at the International College of Management in Sydney. “She is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship, but knows all about them. She is a trusted political figure who helps Kim maintain a positive public image when he is dealing with foreigners or South Koreans.”Yo-jong, who is thought to be four years younger than her brother, was rarely seen in public until 2010, when she was photographed attending a party conference. By the following year, she was a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il’s entourage, and was seen mourning after his death in late 2011.But her journey to the heart of the North Korean regime had arguably begun in the late 1990s, when she attended primary school in Berne, Switzerland at the same time as Kim Jong-un, with whom she lived in a private home, attended to by staff and watched over by bodyguards, according to North Korea Leadership Watch.“They were virtually in exile together, both knowing what the future had in store for them,” Bong said. “They must have gained a tremendous sense of having a common fate. As a result, she has her brother’s unconditional trust.”Little is known about Yo-jong’s life during the period between her graduation with a computer science degree from Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang and 2007, when she began to play a junior role in the ruling party.She is said to have been involved in arranging her brother’s succession as supreme leader after Kim Jong-il suffered two strokes in 2008, but was not mentioned by North Korean state media until March 2014, when she accompanied her brother during elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly.“The North Korean regime is a family business, and Kim Jong-un appears to place trust in his sister,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul. “She has demonstrated skills at modernising the brand of the regime, and has some sway over state propaganda. Her most important function is probably as a confidante to her brother.“But she also has a signalling role because messages from Kim Yo-jong carry more weight than those of an imminently replaceable North Korean official.”Kim Yo-jong’s upward trajectory is expected to continue once the North resumes its nuclear diplomacy in a post-pandemic world. “She plays a pivotal role in North Korean domestic and foreign policy campaigns because she is one of the main stakeholders in the regime’s survival,” Petrov said.But, he added, she would never adopt the mantle of leader should something happen to her brother. “Kim Yo-jong knows how to smooth Kim Jong-un’s initiatives and strengthen his soft power … but she won’t replace the primary decision-maker. North Korea is a Confucian country where seniority and masculinity are respected. She is Kim’s most trusted ally, but no more than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6878e0de0f1a50292e685bcc020037cab510d407/3068_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39b9b784c323f71c6c4aaa17e783e98d","title":"monday briefing un agency bosses in plea for covid 19 aid","story":"Trump plays falsified video of ‘praise’ from Cuomo … gunman kills 16 in Nova Scotia, Canada … and following the trail of Covid-19 in WuhanHello, Warren Murray with the situation report as of this Monday morning.Donald Trump has continued to veer towards using the White House briefing room as a newsroom for dubious campaign messages.

It is the worst act of mass murder the country has seen in modern times. A police officer was among the dead. Officials said the gunman, named as Gabriel Wortman, a denturist aged 51, also died after shooting people in several locations. Authorities said Wortman drove what appeared to be a police car but was actually an SUV disguised as one. “Today is a devastating day for Nova Scotia and it will remain etched in the minds of many for years to come,” said Lee Bergman, commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.‘Invasive beyond reason’ – The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have written to the main tabloid editors to say they will never again deal with their journalists, in an unprecedented attack on a large part of the media that leaves little chance of repairing an already fractured relationship with the press.

They said they refused to “offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion” and accused the outlets of running stories that are “distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason”.

We have stopped a wave of devastation’New Zealanders will remain in total lockdown for another week, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said, with restrictions easing if elimination progress is maintained.Speaking at the Beehive in Wellington, Ardern said New Zealand was in with a fighting chance of eliminating the disease, and the number of deaths was low enough that she still received a phone call for each one.“We have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation,” Ardern said.“Our transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people. We have amongst the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.”The prime minister said New Zealand had a “relatively low proportion of serious cases”, and according to the Oxford University coronavirus government response tracker, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.Overall 1,400 people have become infected with coronavirus in New Zealand, and 12 people have died, all older people with pre-existing health conditions. On Monday, nine new cases were confirmed by the Ministry of Health, but random testing of 1,000 people in the community had returned no positive results.“Nearly every case identified since April 1 is as a result of overseas travel or contact with someone with the virus, often in existing clusters,” Ardern said. “Our testing has scaled up and we have now tested over 85,000 New Zealanders, one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world.”The director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said he was confident community transmission of the virus has not taken hold, but he, and other experts advising the government, had urged them to extend the level four lockdown, to be “extra safe” and solidify the gains already made in lowering infection rates.The government’s decision to conditionally ease restrictions from next Monday night has taken a middle path between those urging an immediate end to lockdown for the sake of the gasping economy, and those urging an extension to give the elimination strategy a fighting chance.Moving to level three overnight on Monday would see many more businesses able to trade, including those involved in takeaways and food deliveries, the construction sector and the forestry sector. The move to level three would have significant benefits for the economy, Ardern said.Social lives would largely be unchanged however, with Kiwis still urged to remain at home unless taking exercise or fetching supplies. “Bubbles” could be marginally expanded, however, to include close family or those who might be alone or isolated in the community, she said. Schools would be open, but students should remain at home, if they could.Cabinet would make a decision whether level three lockdown would move to two on 11 May.New Zealand entered lockdown on 25 March, when there were fewer than 150 cases of the virus and no deaths.Lockdown has been widely complied with countrywide, despite stringent regulations, which have dictated Kiwis stay in their homes around the clock unless shopping for essentials such as food or medicine, or taking a brief respite of exercise within their neighbourhood.The first two weeks of lockdown saw widespread confusion as to what and wasn’t permitted, and the health minister David Clark was demoted after flouting the rules and taking his family to a beach 20km from their home.There have been some isolated reports of lockdown parties, but overall police have praised Kiwis adherence to the rules.New Zealand is pursuing an elimination strategy and is one of few worldwide to do so, but has advantages in being able to completely shut down its borders, having a small number of cases, and cities that are not so densely packed as the likes of New York and London.Epidemiologists working on New Zealand’s Covid-15 strategy urged the prime minister to stay the course and choose the conservative path, saying if the country came out of lockdown too soon, months of good work would be lost.Scientist Dr Michelle Dickinson, who participated in a press conference for children with the prime minister, praised the government’s decision.“While other countries show no sign of any control of Covid-19 I’m so proud of NZ \u0026amp what we’ve done as a nation,” Dickinson said on Twitter.“We had some of the toughest lockdown rules in the world, but today we can be optimistic about coming out of it on Monday \u0026amp feeling safe that this is the right decision”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598255b183faf27db780af45cdba8b3ee439e62c/0_86_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad1f939ef53a1346f8b19df0c4487354","title":"people have been awakened seeking covid 19 answers in wuhan","story":"Residents are looking for an explanation from the government about its handling of coronavirusby  Lily Kuo in WuhanIn early January, Hu Aizhen, 65, heard that a new coronavirus had emerged in her home city, Wuhan. She was not worried – officials said it was not contagious – so she went about her days as usual and prepared for the lunar new year at the end of the month.Just before the city was put under lockdown, Hu developed pneumonia symptoms. After days of waiting and searching for a hospital, she was tested for the virus. Her result was negative, but tests at the time were known to be inaccurate and she showed obvious signs of the virus. Nevertheless, she was refused treatment by six hospitals.Hu, who had always been healthy, stayed at home for 10 days, unable to drink or eat, while her health deteriorated. When she took a further turn for the worse, her son tried to get her to a hospital in another district but police stopped them. Under lockdown orders they could not cross into another district. Her son, desperate, shouted at the traffic officers: “Are you not people?”When Hu was finally admitted to a hospital on 8 February, she was struggling to breathe. The doctor ordered another test, but it was too late. She regained consciousness briefly, asking her son to pour her some water. Then she died.Hu’s son is now suing the Wuhan municipal government for allegedly concealing the seriousness of the virus, among other complaints, according to court documents prepared by Funeng, a public welfare NGO based in Changsha. Hu’s son is among a small but significant group of residents seeking answers, compensation or simply an apology from officials who took weeks to notify the public of the threat from a virus that went on to claim the lives of at least 4,000 people in China, according to government figures, most of them in Wuhan.Other cases include a civil servant suing the Hubei provincial government, a mother petitioning for officials to be punished after watching her 24-year-old daughter die of the virus, and a son who rushed his quickly fading mother to a hospital in the suburbs of Wuhan where he was able to get her admitted to intensive care. When he went to pick up supplies for her, he received a phone call from the hospital. His mother had died.“None of this would have happened if they had told us. So many people would not have had to die,” said a relative involved in one of the lawsuits. Another said: “I want an answer. I want those responsible to be punished under the law.”As the outbreak spread in China, with thousands of confirmed cases a day at its peak, public anger reached levels not seen in decades, posing a serious threat to the ruling Chinese communist party. When the whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang died from the virus in February, censors could not keep up with the flood of outrage online. It was a moment some compared to the outpouring over the death of Hu Yaobang that precipitated the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.A little more than two months on, the resentment is much less visible. Accounts like Hu Aizhen’s have been replaced by positive stories of the country coming together to defeat the virus, sending needed supplies to the rest of the world and fighting malicious attacks from the US and other countries blaming Beijing for the outbreak.“People are easily led by propaganda,” said Shi, a human rights activist based in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. “As the epidemic situation has improved and the propaganda machine works, there has been a reversal. Now people are saying the strong leadership of the party is a good thing.”As Wuhan and the rest of the country slowly return to normal, authorities are carefully monitoring those who might harbour resentment. Zhang Hai, 50, whose father died from the virus in February, was part of a WeChat group of more than 100 people who lost relatives to the virus.In late March they were told they could retrieve their loved ones’ remains from funeral homes. No more than five could go together at one time, and they had to be accompanied by a local government representative. Zhang refused to go. Later, the group’s host was called in by the police and the WeChat group was deleted.“Now everyone is trying to be very careful,” said Zhang, who is calling for the government to issue an apology. “I know a lot of families who are incredibly angry.”Tan Jun, a civil servant in Yichang in Hubei province, filed a complaint this month accusing the Hubei provincial government of concealing the outbreak, according to copies of the lawsuit posted online. Tan confirmed the lawsuit but declined to be interviewed. Other residents in Wuhan who spoke to the  said they had been intimidated by local police and forced to promise not to speak out.“People must take responsibility. As a resident of Hubei, I believe it is necessary to stand up and call on the Hubei government to take responsibility,” Tan said, according to an article posted on several WeChat accounts that has now been deleted.While authorities in Beijing have punished local officials by replacing them – what observers say is an age-old tactic for deflecting blame from the central government – residents say this is not enough.“That is not accountability. That is switching hats,” said Wu, 49, who says she contracted the virus in January but was not officially diagnosed until March. In hospital she watched people around her die, including a woman in the next bed. Recently she learned that a classmate of hers who got sick around the same time had passed away.“When I was laying in bed thinking I might soon die, I thought: how did this happen?” said Wu, who is suing her hospital for not confirming her as a coronavirus patient when she was released. “Regular people have limited access to real information. We rely on the government. We believe what the government says.”Dissent has spread in other ways. Dozens of shop owners at a shopping mall in Wuhan demonstrated this month, demanding rent reductions after months of not being able to open their stores. In Yingcheng, a city west of Wuhan, residents put under lockdown protested against the high prices for food imposed by community management. One of the protesters, Zeng Chunzhi, has reportedly been detained.“People have been awakened. That’s for sure,” said Xie Yanyi, a rights lawyer based in Beijing. Xie has filed a request for information from the government, including the origins of the virus and reasons for the delay in informing the public of the outbreak. “It may not be many people, but history shows that it is the few who change society and who change history,” Xie said.In Wuhan, most residents are relieved that the worst of the epidemic appears to be over as they watch other countries struggle to contain it. Employees wait in lines outside of office buildings to have their throats swabbed, to make sure they do not have the virus before going back to work.On the riverbank in Hankou district, a couple kiss in front of what has become a nightly light show of skyscrapers lit up with congratulatory messages. Many residents say they appreciate what their country has done for them.The chance that cases such as Hu’s will be accepted and go to court are not high, according to Yan Zhanqing, a co-founder of Funeng. More likely, those involved will be intimidated or harassed. But in some cases, especially determined plaintiffs can get compensation, which is one form of apology.“These cases apply pressure on the government and help more people understand their rights and the government’s responsibility,” Yan said. “This is also a way of documenting history, letting more people know the truth, and not just the government’s version of what happened in Wuhan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d012799383ed43e64981895027e0ae0d6d81ba/0_473_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1b0355f86619355bd4a5b476cf8a09","title":"premier foods sales surge amid lockdown demand for store cupboard staples coronavirus covid 19 mr kipling","story":"Mr Kipling producer, Premier Foods, has reported a sales surge as the coronavirus lockdown drives demand for store cupboard items.Premier Foods said during “this challenging time” its manufacturing and distribution were working at “maximum capacity” and demand continued to be high.Each factory worker had been given two additional days of annual leave and a £250 cash bonus.The company added: “Volumes have started to reduce from the exceptional levels seen in March, although are still expected to continue to be higher than average patterns of demand.“This reflects more meals being eaten at home than usual due to recent measures set out by the government, and hence increased demand for the group’s product ranges.”It comes on the back of surging supermarket sales over the past month, as shoppers have stocked up on essentials.Premier Foods made the announcement as it revealed a major shake-up of its pension schemes, following a year-long strategic review at the business.It said this would involve a merger of its three separate pension schemes and would reduce the cash contributions from the group, as Premier looks to save money.The debt-laden business has come under fire from activist investors in recent years, resulting in a leadership shake-up last year.Premier said it expected to post a trading profit for the year ending 28 March at the “top end of market expectations” following a strong March period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c1684f3ad1ea0940c4f123f84ac4be433e8237/0_12_1474_884/master/1474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fab35f513d2fb2c78a3cb1566759e621","title":"vanuatu elects new prime minister as country reels from devastating cyclone","story":"Bob Loughman, an MP from the island of Tanna, will become the next prime minister of the south Pacific nationVanuatu’s parliament has elected a new prime minister more than a month after the country went to the polls, as the country is reeling from a devastating category-five cyclone and preparing for a potential coronavirus outbreak.Bob Loughman, an MP from the island of Tanna, will become the next prime minister of the south Pacific nation, after defeating the former foreign minister Ralph Regenvanu in a vote in parliament on Monday, by 31 votes to 21.Loughman is the leader of the Vanua’aku Pati – one of the oldest political parties in Vanuatu – which secured seven out of 52 seats in elections held on 19 March.Elections are held every four years in Vanuatu and it is extremely rare for a party to win a majority of seats, meaning that governments formed in the country are almost always a coalition of parties.Loughman has been in the Vanuatu parliament since 2004 and has previously served as minister for education and minister for trade and tourism. He also served as deputy prime minister for a period of time under the former prime minister Charlot Salwai.His coalition government will include two other major parties, as well as a raft of independents and micro-parties.Loughman’s government will be required to hit the ground running, after a tumultuous month for the country, which has a population of nearly 300,000 people.The country declared a state of emergency in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, restricting business activity and travel and imposing a curfew on residents.There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in the nation, but there are fears that were coronavirus to reach Vanuatu’s shores, its health system would very quickly become overwhelmed.The country also bore the brunt of the passage of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April.

Photograph: iStockHealth authorities are to examine the potential of reopening primary schools on a limited basis, such as one day a week, in the summer.Minister for Health Simon Harris said officials will closely monitor the experience of other countries such as Denmark which reopened its primary schools last week.He cautioned that any decisions regarding easing current restrictions will be taken on the basis of public health advice.However, he said, on a personal level he saw there was merit in partially reopening primary schools if permitted by public health advice. Secondary schools look set to remain shut for the remainder of the academic year.Such a step would be positive for the mental health and wellbeing of students and parents, he said.“The issue of reopening schools is very much an open question,” he told The  on Sunday.“All issues in relation to easing any restrictions will be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and will follow public health advice.”Current public health restrictions are in place until May 5th, at which stage they will be reviewed.Any easing of measures will depend on public compliance and the advice of public health experts.It is understood that if primary schools do partially reopen, it is more likely to be take place in June and would be subject to social distancing measures.In Denmark, for example, pupils’ desks are spaced apart and children are required to wash their hands on an hourly basis. At break-time, children are only allowed out in small groups.Mr Harris also explained his personal views of why opening schools would be a positive development for children in an interview with the Sunday Independent.“I’d like to see a situation whereby our schools could come back or at least could come partially back. Now I can’t guarantee the timeline for this, but in terms of you’re asking me the hierarchy of things, I’d like to see comeback that would be one of them,” he told the newspaper.“From a socially distanced, safe point of view, meet their friends, and then go home. That would provide breathing space for families and information and I think that would help.”In response to Mr Harris’s comments, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said any decision to reopen primary schools must be led by public health advice.“Engagement with workers and their unions must take place in advance of any such decision,” an INTO spokesman said.“The health and safety of teachers, pupils and parents must be guaranteed before our schools reopen. We should look closely at the small number of jurisdictions where some schools have opened and endeavour to avoid repeating any mistakes that may have been made elsewhere.”The spokesman added that primary teachers were ready to resume facilitating the continuity of learning remotely from Monday, following the Easter holidays.School managers, teachers’ unions and other education partners, meanwhile, are meeting with the Department of Education on a weekly basis between now and the end of May to discuss issues relating to supporting students and the State exams.Sources say the possibility of secondary schools opening later than normal in September and on a staggered basis has been discussed.This could allow for classes to attend for part of the week and to continue remote learning for the rest of the week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232733.1587308841!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"potentially lethal bacteria found in irish bathing waters deemed excellent by eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland is the worst country in the European Union for Shiga-toxigenic E.coli infection rates, suffering up to 10 times the European average. File photograph: Getty ImagesA potentially lethal strain of E.coli has been found in Irish beaches, rivers and lakes which are popular with bathers and deemed to have excellent water quality under EU standards.Researchers say the bacteria, known as Shiga-toxigenic E.coli (STEC), can cause disease, severe intestinal infection, potentially renal failure and even death.Ireland is the worst country in the European Union for STEC infection rates, suffering up to 10 times the European average.In a study, led by Prof Dearbháile Morris and Dr Louise O’Connor at the School of Medicine in NUI Galway, academics tested water samples from the sea, rivers and lakes between December 2018 and October 2019.River samplesAll 75 sites are used by people for bathing and recreation. Some 49 – or 65 per cent – showed up positive for the presence of the disease-causing strain of the bacteria.More than nine in 10 (93 per cent) of river samples were positive, as were three quarters (75 per cent) of lake samples and more than half (56 per cent) of seawater samples.“There was a high occurrence of genetic markers for STEC in the samples tested, highlighting the need for further investigation to establish the scale of the problem, not only in Ireland but globally,” said Prof Morris.“It is worth noting that all of the bathing waters tested were designated as of good or excellent quality based on current EU bathing water quality monitoring criteria.”Under that criteria, bathing water quality is assessed on the estimated total number of E. coli in a 100ml sample between May to September.Most E. coli are not harmful, but some like STEC can be poisonous.“Bathing waters in Europe and elsewhere are not routinely monitored for the presence of STEC,” said Prof Morris, who believes the research is the first of its kind in Ireland.“This study highlights the limitations of only assessing the total number of E. coli present as an indicator of water quality without taking into consideration the potential pathogenicity of some variants.”The research was due to be presented at the European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Paris this month, but the event was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The details of the 75 sites where water was sampled are not been published. They included 52 seawater samples, 15 river samples and 8 lake water samples."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: GettyWe need to “test the living death” out of everyone in residential nursing homes, including staff, if we are going to eradicate Covid-19 there, a consultant geriatrician providing support to the sector has said.Prof Sean Kennelly, who is based at Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, is providing support to 14 nursing homes in the southwest of the city, as well as to St Michael’s House in Cheeverstown and other residential facilities for the intellectually disabled.Between 45 and 60 per cent of all Covid-related deaths in the UK, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy have been residents of nursing homes, he said.“I think that is the most important thing to stress. What is happening in Ireland is not an outlier.”The fact that the most vulnerable members of the population were gathered together in nursing homes was the key factor, he said. “What we are experiencing, unfortunately, is not unusual.”He said he and his colleagues are noticing lots of elderly patients who are infected but are not showing the symptoms that were typical in the Chinese outbreak, such as temperature and a cough.Older people can present with gastrointestinal problems or confusion, and can be infectious for a period before they come to show any significant symptoms.“Only 30-35 per cent of nursing home residents that have Covid-19 will have a temperature,” he said.Abrupt declineOn Friday the National Public Health Emergency Team announced that up to 100,000 staff and residents of long-term residential care facilities were going to be urgently tested.Prof Kennelly said 10 of the 14 nursing homes he is working with have residents with the infection.“In many of the nursing homes I have been dealing with, an unexpected death has occurred in the preceding week or two.”It was a feature of the new disease that a person could be very seriously infected but be without symptoms before going into an abrupt decline. This was why comprehensive testing was needed, he said.There was also an urgent need for a regulatory body to assess those nursing homes where there had been significant outbreaks, to decide if they were suitable places for sending new residents, he said.“Beds are being freed up in these nursing homes, unfortunately, as a result of people passing away. Most of these are private operators, and they have to be able to pay their staff. The acute hospitals are, as always, under pressure and need to free up beds. We need to find a way of doing that in a safe fashion.”Unsuitable placesSome nursing homes, through no fault of their own, may no longer be suitable places for elderly residents in the context of Covid-19 because of their physical structure, he said. “There are going to have to be some difficult conversations.”Prof Kennelly said that the families of residents who were sick or who had died, or who are not able to visit loved ones, had been going through a very traumatic time.Once the crisis was under control, thought would have to be given to how it might be possible to reopen visiting arrangements.“Is a life worth living if you spend 18 months away from seeing your family, and run the potential risk of dying without seeing them again at all?”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232868.1587336258!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland may endure repeated waves of covid 19 epidemics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA youngster and her puppy, Jack, on the beach at  Portrush   in Co Antrim as the sun goes down.

Photograph:  Margaret McLaughlinIreland may have to cope with repeated waves of Covid-19 epidemics until a large enough proportion of the population is infected to provide possible herd immunity, new research warns.At best, there may be three more cycles of infection before 60 per cent of the population have the virus, regarded as sufficient to provide potential herd immunity, according to the modelling analysis led by an Irish scientist at King’s College London.However, it could take up to nine further waves of infection – and ensuing lockdowns – before possible herd immunity is reached, under a second model developed by Dr Rosalyn Moran and her fellow researchers.The issue of herd immunity has been the subject of intense debate however during the Covid-19 pandemic with WHO epidemiologists warning in recent days that there was no proof yet that having had a coronavirus infection will confer immunity for a significant period of time.The current outbreak in Ireland is peaking around now, according to the King’s College analysis, which estimates the eventual cumulative death toll at between 1,008 and 1,250.Dr Moran emphasises there is “nothing set in stone” about the modelling predictions made in the research which, she says, shows the need for Ireland to replicate South Korean levels of testing for the virus and contact tracing for known cases.The number of deaths and confirmed cases reported in the Republic on Sunday both showed a slight decline on recent days. Another 39 people died from Covid-19, while there were a further 493 confirmed cases of the virus, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said.There have now been 610 Covid-19-related deaths in the State, while the number of confirmed cases stands at 15,251.Air of complacencyMinister for Health Simon Harris said on Sunday night he feared an air of complacency was “creeping in” in relation to Ireland’s battle against Covid-19 which has to be pushed back against. “We are making really good progress ... but the progress is fragile. We are in a very delicate moment and it would not take much for that to be reversed,” he said.He appealed to people not to become relaxed about the restrictions. “Now is not the time for complacency ... that would be disastrous, it could potentially be fatal,” he added.All but two of the deaths reported on Sunday were in the east of the country.Dr Moran’s research suggests somewhere between 6.5 per cent and 16.7 per cent of the Irish population will have been affected by the current epidemic of coronavirus, and therefore may enjoy some immunity from the disease. In the UK, where 50,000 deaths are forecast by the research, it is estimated 19.6 per cent will have been affected by its outbreak.The research, which looked at the number of “lockdown cycles” that may be needed in seven European countries, says a large proportion of the total population in each country will remain without immunity after the current wave of infection. “This suggests that in the absence of strong seasonal effects, new medications or more comprehensive contact tracing, a further set of epidemic waves in different geographic centres are likely. These findings may have implications for ‘exit strategies’ from any lockdown stage.”Eliminated backlogThe Health Service Executive said yesterday it has eliminated the backlog of people waiting for Covid-19 tests. It said 27 laboratories, including one in Germany, are now processing 10,000 test results a day.Over the weekend, 4,000 staff and residents in nursing homes were tested as part of a heightened response by the HSE to escalating cases and deaths in the sector. The number of outbreaks or suspected outbreaks in long-term residential care facilities now stands at 248, according to the HSE.Meanwhile, the biggest teachers’ union in the State has warned the health and safety of pupils and teaching staff must be guaranteed before any decision is taken to reopen primary schools.The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) was responding to comments by Mr Harris, who raised the possibility of a partial reopening of schools at the weekend.If schools do reopen it could be on the basis of a day a week, the Minister suggested.But last night Mr Harris said: “We are going to have this virus with us for a long time. I don’t expect a light switch moment on the 5th of May where restrictions which are in place are all of a sudden reversed.”Meanwhile Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was due to receive on Sunday night the results of a review into the rules around foreign workers and travel.Bulgarian workersMr Varadkar ordered the review after fruit producer Keelings flew almost 200 Bulgarians into Ireland to\u0026nbspwork on its farms.The 189 workers arrived into Dublin on a chartered aircraft last week to carry out seasonal work on Keelings fruit farms. It is understood that a series of options will be presented in the paper which will then be considered by the Cabinet Covid 19 committee on Monday. A Government source said the issue was “difficult” as the workers could be considered essential workers, but concerns remained about the safety of the travel arrangements.Sources said one option that is likely to be considered on foot of the review is checking in on those who travel into Ireland to ensure that they remain in isolation for the designated 14 day period.There are now more than 2.3 million cases of coronavirus around the world and more than 160,000 deaths, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.

The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Mongkhonsawat LeungvorapanReutersThailand has found the largest number of nests of rare leatherback sea turtles in two decades on beaches bereft of tourists because of the coronavirus pandemic, environmentalists say.From wild boars patrolling the Israeli city of Haifa to deer venturing into London suburbs, virus closures are drawing wildlife into the abandoned streets of many cities.In Thailand, with 2,765 infections and 47 deaths, travel curbs ranging from a ban on international flights to an appeal to citizens to stay home have brought a collapse in tourist numbers, but freed up the beaches for wildlife.The 11 turtle nests authorities have found since last November were the highest number in 20 years, said Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, the director of the Phuket Marine Biological Center.“This is a very good sign for us because many areas for spawning have been destroyed by humans,” he told Reuters. No such nests had been found for the previous five years.“If we compare to the year before, we didn’t have this many spawn, because turtles have a high risk of getting killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.”Leatherbacks are the world’s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches.

Sir Patrick couldn’t deny it.“That is a real prospect, this is a nasty disease.”Neither he nor his interlocutor spelled out the numbers, but anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that achieving herd immunity might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference.The PM had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for a week but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight the government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College, London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the Imperial team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the “herd immunity” press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that fully suppressing the virus with a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak towards the end of the year.“We want to…not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.”Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, the latest offering from Imperial had indeed made an impact and a seismic change in thinking was now taking place in the government’s inner circle. Actually seeing the numbers starkly on a page – 250,000 deaths unless we lockdown the country – had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television by the hapless Sir Patrick, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit of was now being actively considered in No10. The government was about to change direction, but it was hardly to be a handbrake turn.It was a full eleven days after the Imperial study’s call for full suppression before Mr Johnson announced that he was putting the country into lockdown. That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials such as food or exercise and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path.Why did it take so long to get here? Is it definitely the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the government in such times of crisis.SAGE, and the three sub-committees which feed into it, are comprised of a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats. This opaque nature, and the fact that the committees are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and particularly mathematical modellers, has led to criticism.Professor Anthony Costello, of University College’s Institute for Global Health, says: “I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians – and maybe citizen scientists – people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.”Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists. One report, submitted to SAGE on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various anti-viral interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be “highly disruptive” and “likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society.”Some committee members clearly felt it would cause to “discontent” to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said that explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them “will make this acceptable.”This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson himself, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister, “He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn’t realise was that every week’s delay on an exponential part of the curve can be a disaster.”Prof Costello points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races, as pictured below, in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error.His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered.“I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he’s the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.“I can’t believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it’s just the formula for spread.”Sir David’s perception is that, unlike in his time as Chief Scientific Adviser, when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more like the other way round with scientific advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor, he says, “It was very clear that he does want people to like him and as a scientist he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.”Having finally opted for lockdown, the government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily and depending too much on the mathematical modellers.Professor Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King’s College, London, says, “They went from almost nothing, which was \u0027oh, we\u0027re going to ban a few mass gatherings here\u0027 to the full lockdown, just like that.”Prof Sullivan says that he has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but that his pleas have been ignored. He fears those suffering from non-Covid-19 conditions will now suffer.“The mistake that was made was the models were not red-teamed properly, which means you give it to other people in other areas who model other indirect causes, you say what’s wrong with this model?...They were not exposed to a sufficient critique.”The problem with mathematical modellers, he adds, is that the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it right, of course you get it right, but if you get it wrong you can’t see you’ve got it wrong.”Whether Prof Ferguson at Imperial has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark.His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease was disputed.In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen the then agriculture minister John Selwyn Gummer attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date is fewer than 200. Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200 million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4 million.The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact around 19,000.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling.As the debate over the justification for the lockdown goes on, now the government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary. The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone a mask is not going to make much difference and can, conversely, make people less careful about keeping their distance while making them more prone to touching their own masks and faces.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our eventual exit from the lockdown. He says, “I’m envisaging in the coming weeks and months that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal – the Covid-ready normal – they will be wanting to wear face protection.”He says that after the SARS outbreak in Asia “people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second reason is to show to others that they’re taking it seriously.”The exit strategy is very much on academic minds. For this part of the process, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, Professor of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an advisor to one of the SAGE sub committees.“There is a space in the policy making that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics…you could argue there is a gap in the system of expert advice for that kind of input.“Modellers are smart people but they’re mathematicians primarily and that’s why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context. That’s why you need to have an understanding of the real world.“Ferguson for example keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all or nothing thing. Whereas if we’re going to talk about an exit strategy, there isn’t going to be a VE day where we declare it’s all over.”One problem, he says, is that “the government have ramped up the level of fear to a point where it’s very hard for people to hear the messages about ‘this is the way out’.” He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as “cruel and unjust.”“It’s a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.“If the politicians are trying to follow the science, and the science is only giving them a limited range of input, then it might be quite difficult for some of these everyday considerations to get taken more seriously.Prof Sullivan echoes some of those points: I think the fear out there is extraordinary. Now, it’s our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There’s been a real perspective loss here.“I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalizing again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.”In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people – and anyone they have had contact with - can remain in isolation, will also be essential. Only then, it seems, can the rest of us – with or without masks – realistically hope to return to something resembling normality.But with the government struggling to even reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine, which could take a year or even two to produce on the necessary scale. According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, “I’m afraid it comes down to this problem of, are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen?“Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.”After all this, herd immunity?But then, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer told the media last week, “The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.”Perhaps Sir Patrick won’t find he has anything to regret after all.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"better coronavirus testing may not have saved lives deputy chief","story":"Better coronavirus testing may not have reduced the UK death toll, the deputy chief medical officer has suggested, as she questioned whether it had helped Germany.Dr Jenny Harries has staunchly defended the government’s original approach, saying it was right to switch focus to managing people’s condition rather than testing, once the virus had got out of control in the community.It comes less than a week after Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, conceded more testing should have been undertaken.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference last night, Dr Harries described the initial “Contain” phase of the response, where testing of suspected cases was vigorously pursued, as “very successful”.She also said there was no evidence to connect German’s policy of continued aggressive testing with its significantly lower mortality figures.“We are at different phases of the pandemic” she said, cautioning that the rates of disease in Germany are starting to rise.“I think we have rather ended up with a conversation which is a demand on testing without necessarily seeing that causal link.”Whilst acknowledging that it is important to investigate the link between better testing and reduced death figures, she said: “I think the actual mechanism between the two is still not clear.”As of 9am on Sunday, 16,060 people have died in hospitals in the UK having tested positive for Covid-19, although many more have died in the community, including at least an estimated 7,500 in care homes.So far, more than 482,000 tests have been conducted, with 21,626 tests on Saturday.Germany had recorded 4,547 deaths from coronavirus as of yesterday.At the beginning of this month, Germany was conducting more than 50,000 tests a day, and as of April 15 it had conducted the highest number of coronavirus tests in Europe at 1,728,357.Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had passed the peak of the virus.She said: I would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but I\u0027m not going to be, for a number of reasons.She identified that the low number of deaths recorded today was positive but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised.She said: We could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldn\u0027t.I do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across.But she added: If we don\u0027t keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely won\u0027t be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this.But I do think things look to be heading in the right direction.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german regions force citizens wear masks following success city","story":"The German government is under pressure to make mask-wearing compulsory in public after the success of a city-wide trial. Several German regions and cities sent a clear signal to Angela Merkel\u0027s government that they don\u0027t see its advice on face masks as adequate, with two states announcing inidual measures to enforce face mask usage.The eastern state of Saxony announced that everyone will have to wear a face mask as of Monday when entering shops or travelling on public transport. Wolfsburg, hometown of Volkswagen, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania soon followed suit, announcing mandatory masks  in public starting the following week.Stephan Weil, state leader in Lower Saxony, said he was convinced that everyday face masks will soon become part of our pubic life and that they could be made compulsory on public transport as soon as we have enough stocks.”  The moves come after the city of Jena has seen new cases of the virus flatline since it brought in compulsory masks on April 6th. Sunday was the tenth day in a row that no new cases were reported there, although authorities have declined to say whether they believe the mask rule is primarily responsible.It came as Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, promised on Sunday that face-masks would be widely distributed “within weeks” as the country prepares a gradual exit from lockdown starting on May 11 and said they would probably be compulsory on public transport. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, said half a million masks would he handed out to the capital’s residents by the end of this month. She pledged that the more than 2 million people living in central Paris would receive free masks by mid-May, which will cost the city authorities €3 million (£2.6m).On Wednesday, while announcing a gradual relaxation of the country\u0027s lockdown, Ms Merkel stopped short of enforcing face mask usage in public, instead calling it a “strong recommendation.”  Stockpiles would not appear to be a problem, as the government confirmed earlier in the month that it had received delivery of 80 million masks while official guidelines make clear that using a scarf or a homemade mask is acceptable.Despite growing political pressure, a blanket mask requirement remains controversial among virologists. Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg has called the debate misguided, saying that “we need to try and achieve a slow infection of the population, one hundred percent protection doesn’t help anyone.”In Spain, the government has announced that it is to fix the cost of face masks to prevent abusive pricing in a situation where demand has outstripped supply.Spain has struggled to import sufficient quantities of masks during the crisis, and last week the health ministry was forced to order the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of FFP2 masks from hospitals after a batch, purchased from China, was found to be substandard.Security forces handed out up to 10 million face masks to people travelling to work in the days after the Easter weekend, when Spain’s economic lockdown was eased to allow workers in construction and other non-essential sectors to return to their jobs.Ministers have said that sufficient face masks will be available for the entire population to purchase from chemists this week with the national healthcare card, as in the case of prescription drugs.The CGCF pharmacies’ body has welcomed the move as the only way to “prioritise distribution to the most vulnerable”, but it also warned that as of Friday it had not been informed of any timetable for the rolling out of this system.Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s health emergency department, said on Sunday that there was still no plan to make the use of masks obligatory. “The use of face masks is a recommendation, but it is just one of many ways to reduce the risk of contagion.”The Spanish health ministry announced on Sunday morning that 410 people had died of Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, the lowest daily toll for four weeks. The death toll since the start of the country’s epidemic now stands at 20,453, with close to 200,000 confirmed cases.In Germany, where official figures put fatalities at the relatively low figure of 4,300, the pandemic is continuing to erode the popularity of the far-right AfD party and the Greens, both of whom had previously been performing strongly in polling. The AfD have fallen into the single digits for the first time in three years, while the environmental party have slumped from the low twenties to the mid teens as voters rally behind Ms Merkel’s CDU, who are widely viewed to be managing the crisis well.Meanwhile Berlin announced over the weekend the long-delayed arrival of the first refugee children from overcrowded Greek refugee camps. Some 50 children landed at Hanover airport, well below the figure of 1,500 promised by Berlin in March. The minors will now spend two weeks in quarantine.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"isil linked jihadis target mozambiques gas fields","story":"For more than two years the fighters waged a war so shadowy no-one really knew why they were fighting or even what they called themselves.They seemed to come out of nowhere, bands of masked men who attacked villages in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, carried out mass beheadings and then vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared. Up to 1,000 soldiers and civilians have so far been killed by the group. Then, in the past few weeks, everything changed.No longer masked, the militants seized important towns and villages in a series of sophisticated operations launched under the noses of a Kremlin-linked Russian mercenary outfit.Unfurling the black flag of Islamic State in southern Africa for the first time, the fighters defiantly declared their intention to turn a region that will soon be vital to Britain’s energy security into a Sharia-based caliphate.Until recently, Cabo Delgado’s insurgency had garnered little attention in Western capitals.For many politicians, it seemed to be just another obscure conflict taking place in a chronically corrupt country with a long history of violence.But the latest attacks and the threat they potentially pose to what is becoming one of the world’s most important gas regions are causing a rapid and urgent reassessment.Until recently, the violence in Cabo Delgado had indeed seemed like a local affair.True, the group responsible for it had initially been dominated by foreigners, radical east African Muslims who fled down the Swahili coast after their leader, Aboud Rogo, was killed by police in Kenya in 2012. But they were rapidly able to find adherents among the local population.Cabo Delgado should be one of the richest regions in Africa. Not only does it boast the world’s largest ruby mine, it is home to a £44bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) programme — the continent’s largest ever energy project — that is being developed by some of the world’s biggest oil companies.With investment in the LNG project set to double over the coming decade, Cabo Delgado is turning Mozambique into an energy superpower, one of the ten largest producers of natural gas in the world.As Britain’s North Sea reserves dwindle, the UK is among those queuing up for a share of the region’s resources. Last year Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, entered into a joint venture to buy 2.6m tonnes of LNG from Mozambique a year for the next two decades.The mostly Muslim population of Cabo Delgado has seen little of the wealth, however. The region is by far the least developed in Mozambique and its 2.3 million people the poorest, making some ripe for recruitment.As its ranks swelled, the group -- which operated under a series of names, most commonly Ansar al-Sunna -- grew steadily bolder after launching its first attacks in 2017, culminating in its apparent adoption into the ISIL franchise at some point in the past six months.Increasingly worried by the group\u0027s growing capability, Mozambique’s government last year deployed 200 Russian mercenaries to Cabo Delgado from the Wagner Group, believed to be owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin.Although the Russians arrived with attack helicopters, drones and sophisticated weaponry they were swiftly forced to make a “tactical retreat”. As many as 12 Russians have been killed, according to diplomats.Success against the Russians seems to have emboldened the militants further.From mid-March the number of attacks has surged.In the most significant, militants marched into the port of Mocimboa da Praia on 23rd March and seized control of the town.  Although they marched out 24 hours later — replicating a tactic used by al Shabaab in Somalia and Isil fighters in the Middle East — they had made their point. Mocimboa da Praia is just an hour’s drive from gas fields.Amid a collapse in oil prices and economic uncertainty unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic, the escalation in the insurgency is making western energy companies increasingly anxious.The reaction to the jihadist occupation of some towns, with many locals coming onto the streets to cheer, will do little to allay their nerves.It is difficult to tell how genuine the support is. Stepping up their public relations campaign, the Islamists have sought to woo people by distributing stolen food and blowing up cash machines to dole out banknotes.But support may also be rooted in fear. “We don’t want to hurt you,” a militant leader told residents in one captured town, according to video footage. “If you do not report us to the police, we will live with you.”“But if you denounce us and tell the pigs where we are hiding, the next time we come here we will kill everything, even chickens and eggs, old people and babies.”The threats, Western officials say, are working because neither locals nor the energy companies have any confidence in the ability of the underpaid and demoralised security forces to stand up to the jihadists.Instead of fighting when towns were attacked, many soldiers and police officers have been ditching their uniforms and blending into the civilian population, locals say.Few therefore believe Mozambique’s national police commander, Bernardino Rafael, who claims that the situation in Cabo Delgado is under control and the insurgents are merely a handful of “criminals” who will soon be dealt with.“When armed men come, instead of defending the population, the police flee,” said Viana Magalhaes, a senior opposition politician.  “If a group of insurgents can take control of a whole province, then the country has no protection.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pope says inequality could worse virus","story":"Pope Francis warned against excluding marginalised sectors of society from global solidarity and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic Sunday, saying to do so could result in an even worse virus.The Argentinian pontiff traveled outside the Vatican for the first time in several weeks to celebrate Sunday mass at a nearby Rome church to mark Divine Mercy Sunday.Just a few select priests were present in the pews due to the strict lockdown in Italy, the first European nation to suffer an outbreak of the pandemic and pass restrictive lockdown measures that have been in place for six weeks now.  In his homily Sunday, Francis said the global toll from the pandemic is a reminder that there are no frontiers or differences in nationalities between the suffering.“We are all frail, all equal, all precious,” he said,  acknowledging that the faithful have been deeply shaken by the rapid spread of the virus. “It is time to eliminate inequalities and heal the injustices that are undermining the health of the whole human family.”Pope Francis, who has promoted the idea of creating a universal basic wage to help those suffering from the economic hardships in the wake of pandemic lockdown measures, urged an “all-embracing vision” for a collective future.  The risk is that we may then be struck by an even worse virus, that of selfish indifference,” he said.More than 23,000 have died from COVID19 in Italy, but the number of new contagions has been dropping daily and the strain on the country’s hospitals has largely eased with the decline in ICU patients for two consecutive weeks.  A government task force is considering a number of options for “Phase II” of the emergency, pegged for May 4, when some restrictive measures are set to be lifted and some businesses may reopen.  Among the options being considered are iding the country into macro areas based on infection rates, which has been contested by a number of northern governors, and voluntary use of a contact-tracing app called “immuni.”The smart phone app, based on Bluetooth technology and developed by the Milan-based Bending Spoons SPA company, would work by regularly emitting an anonymous ID code picked up by other smartphones users also using the same app within a few metre-wide field. If one of the app users reports having tested positive for the virus, the system would allow for informing those with whom they may have come into contact in previous days.  Another option allows users to store information about their health and update it – for example if they have a fever or cough – in a digital “clinical diary” feature. European criteria prohibits the use of geo tracking, hence the app would use Bluetooth and be strictly voluntary. But some 60 per cent of the population would need to download and use it, for it to be effective. Italians appear to be growing increasingly impatient with the stringent restrictions that prohibit many activities and limit their movement to their residential postal code. Law enforcement have done 257,227 checks across the country, and 8,200 have been fined for breaking the containment restrictions.The city of Rimini boasted about using a drone to bust one man taking the sun alone on a vast stretch of city beach. In Carpi, near Modena, a man was fined for taking his hamster out in a cage to a closed park for a breath of fresh air. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us","story":"The line of cars stretched for more than a mile from the steps of Maryland\u0027s wooden-domed state capitol in Annapolis.Horns blared in protest for hours as signs and giant flags saying Trump 2020 No More Bulls--- were waved from windows.We want our city opened now! a middle-aged woman screamed from the passenger seat of an expensive white SUV. A girl, aged about 10, leaned out of her family\u0027s sedan with a handwritten sign reading Covid is a Lie!.Unlike recent protests in industrial states like Michigan and Ohio, the capital of Maryland was an improbable setting for an anti-lockdown rebellion.Annapolis, a genteel city of 40,000 on Chesapeake Bay an hour from Washington DC, is known as the sailing capital of America, and is home to the US Naval Academy.The average income is twice the national average. Unemployment has not previously been an issue.But this weekend\u0027s vehicle-based protest - called Operation Gridlock - mobilised middle class Annapolitans in numbers the organisers, a group called ReOpen Maryland, had never expected. Hundreds paraded through the city\u0027s narrow central streets. Many in American suburbia, it seems, have had enough.Protester David Thalheimer, 58, an engineer, stuck a large sign out the sun roof of his SUV quoting the poet Robert Frost. The best way out is always through, the sign said.It means you can\u0027t delay the inevitable, we have to just go through the virus, Mr Thalheimer said. “Sensible measures there can be, but what we have now is way too much. It\u0027s hitting the economy exponentially and we can\u0027t continue like this. They need to test people. Instead, they\u0027ve just done all this out of fear.Natalie Brown, 43, who runs a successful, though currently stalled, travel business, brought a sign saying This is 2020 not 1984.She said: It’s getting to be like an Orwell novel come to life. They\u0027re talking about tracking us for coronavirus. Google and Yahoo will be tracking and pinging us. It\u0027s all a total violation of our laws and constitutional rights.We need common sense and locking people up isn\u0027t common sense. A lot of people are suffering from mental health issues as a result. These are draconian measures and the state governors aren\u0027t listening. I think we\u0027re seeing a power grab by the governors.She added: Our governor doesn\u0027t like Donald Trump, so he\u0027s just doing the opposite of what Trump says. Trump says reopen, so he doesn\u0027t reopen.Most US states have imposed some form of lockdown measures and they remain popular.According to a Quinnipiac poll taken in early April, 81 per cent, including 68 per cent of Republicans, back a national stay-at-home order. But in recent days Americans who want an end to stay-at-home orders, like the one in place in Maryland, have felt buoyed by the president.He has encouraged states to liberate themselves, offering sympathy for protesters and tirades for, mostly Democrat, state governors who refuse to countenance a quick lifting of restrictions.This weekend other protests took place in the state capitals of Texas, Indiana, Nevada and Wisconsin. Larry Hogan, Maryland\u0027s governor, is a Republican, but he has been critical of Mr Trump\u0027s handling of the crisis.Mr Hogan is also chairman of the powerful National Governors Association. Andrew Coumo of New York is the vice chairman.ReOpen Maryland called on Mr Hogan to immediately end his closure of the state\u0027s businesses, schools and churches.They’ve lost their businesses, their livelihoods. This cannot go on. This is not sustainable. These are real people behind the numbers.Participants in the protest were advised to stay in their cars to avoid breaking Mr Hogan\u0027s ban on gatherings of more than 10 people.However, a small number did abandon their vehicles. They included a man in a Grateful Dead T-shirt, and no mask, who waved a giant US flag near the capitol.Another protester, a military veteran, said he was not scared of catching the virus and would rather die than give up my freedoms.As cars poured by the capitol\u0027s manicured lawns many Annapolitans made their feelings known through words painted on their windscreens.They wrote statements like The models are wrong, Legalise Church, We the people, Live Free or Die, and 1776, a reference to the Declaration of Independence.One man shouted through a megaphone: I’m not wearing masks to show my submission.Glen James, 60, who runs a business supplying fish to local restaurants, brought a sign saying Open Boating.He said: The government\u0027s gone way too far. I think Hogan believes fish have coronavirus.The marina\u0027s closed, they won\u0027t let us put a boat in the water. There are all these small businesses associated with boating, so we\u0027re all boat people.Maryland has suffered around 500 coronavirus deaths, and more than 12,000 cases so far. According to Mr Hogan the peak has not yet been reached.He will not reopen anything until daily figures have declined for at least 14 consecutive days, and testing capacity has tripled.So far, Maryland has lost 300,000 jobs in a month.Mr Hogan said he understood the protesters\u0027 anger. I\u0027m a lifelong small business guy. There\u0027s nothing more important to me than getting our economy back, getting people to work.Outside the capitol a lone counter-protester, Amy Windham 51, a health researcher, stood with a thick mask on her face, waving a Go Home sign at passing vehicles.They have they\u0027re right to protest and so do I, she said. But I think they\u0027re being irresponsible.“It’s unfortunate that people have lost their jobs, and we do need to open, but we need to preserve public safety first.She was interrupted as a woman wound down the window of a passing SUV and, without a mask, yelled You go home!Ms Windham said it wasn\u0027t the first, or worst, abuse she had received.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wolf seen northern france first time century","story":"A wolf has reportedly been seen and photographed in Normandy, near France’s Channel coast, for the first time in a century.European grey wolves re-entered France from Italy in the 1990s after being hunted to extinction in the 1930s. They have been spreading across the country, but none had previously been sighted so far north.The wolf was photographed at night by an automatic surveillance camera near the village of Londinières, in the Seine-Maritime department. The Prefecture said in a statement that experts at the French Bioersity Office, a state organisation that monitors the country’s wolf population, “have authenticated this observation as very probably being a grey wolf”.The sighting of a lone wolf is not surprising, the Prefecture said. Young wolves typically roam alone in spring, when they leave the packs where they were born to find a mate. “They can cover distances of several hundred kilometres in a few months before settling. The maximum distance from the place of birth can exceed 1,500 kilometres (1,350 miles),” according to the Prefecture.France’s wolves, estimated to number about 530, live mainly in the Alps, the south-east and the east of the country. Conservationists have welcomed the expansion of the wolf population but farmers are demanding the right to cull more of them to reduce attacks on livestock. Wolves kill thousands of sheep each year.The agriculture ministry, which is in charge of regulating the wolf population, set the quota allowed to be killed at 17 per cent in January.As an endangered species, the grey wolf is protected under EU law. Wolves have spread to every country in continental Europe, but France, Italy, Denmark, Latvia and Estonia are lobbying Brussels to allow farmers to shoot more of the animals, arguing that they threaten farming communities and livelihoods. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 20th april 2020","story":"Spaced eight feet apart, United States Air Force Academy cadets celebrate their graduation as a team of F-16 Air Force Thunderbirds fly over the academy in Colorado Springs, ColoradoNew Zealand to ease lockdown as Jacinda Ardern says country avoided \u0026#39uncontrolled explosion\u0026#39What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?Politics latest news: PPE shortages caused because \u0026#39consignments have failed\u0026#39, says NHS bossLord Deighton profile: The London Olympics supremo who joins the coronavirus top team as PPE tsarPrince Harry and Meghan Markle tell British tabloids they are \u0026#39ceasing all co-operation\u0026#39Coronavirus cases in Birmingham and the Midlands, mappedCoronavirus cases in Scotland, mappedCan I go to work?

One researcher said it had the potential to be really, really stunning as it reached its closest point to Earth, in May.The comet that took 100 million years to pass EarthBut shortly after it became clear that the comet was actually distintegrating, getting dimmer as it did.As well as offering a chance to see the comet as it breaks apart, the images may prove useful to the scientists studying the object. Relatievely little is known about the object, which was only discovered at the very end of 2019.Comet Atlas is still heading on its trajectory towards Earth. Its orbit is similar to the famous Great Comet of 1844, and it is thought that the two might both be pieces of what was once a larger comet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,” Mr Jermey writes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe blunt acknowledgement by Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcomes amid increasing anger at home and abroad over\u0026nbspfailures by national governments to prepare\u0026nbspadequately for\u0026nbspthe infectious disease, which has so far claimed more than 150,000\u0026nbsplives globally.\u0026nbsp​“Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated,” Mr Jermey writes.\u0026nbsp”The truth is, we knew this was coming.”The message would\u0026nbspappear relevant for successive Conservative governments, which\u0026nbsphave been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings\u0026nbspwithin “pandemic preparedness” documents over the past decade.To minimise the risk of future pandemics, Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcalls for the international community to focus on better regulation of so-called “wet markets”, such as the one in Wuhan largely considered the epicentre of the outbreak, and a renewed battle against the “illegal and unsustainable” wildlife trade.\u0026nbspOf the latter, Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent and Evening Standard, wrote last week: “From the financing of terrorists like Al-Shabab to the propagation of corruption and smuggling groups, this demand has done untold damage to the African continent.

Today the UK deaths were down to 596, from 888 yesterday.”She added: “It is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data ... that we are now starting to plateau”.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastBut she warned the government should be “extremely guarded” and it was “not fair” to say the peak was over.She added that if the public did not continue social\u0026nbspdistancing “we will create a second peak and then we definitely won’t be past it”.Her comments came amid questions on when Britain’s lockdown might be relaxed and after Sir Jeremy, who is advising the government as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the number of coronavirus-related deaths was “either stabilising or starting to come down”.Asked whether the UK was past its peak, he told Sky News’\u0026nbspSophy\u0026nbspRidge on Sunday: “Yes – of this first wave.”\u0026nbspHowever, he said the current outbreak should not be viewed as a “discrete episode”.“I think the probability and what we must be planning for is that there would be further waves of this in the future, but for this first wave I think the number of new infections stabilised maybe a week or two ago, and the number of hospitalisations maybe a week or so ago.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because before we do, we need to meet five tests.”Mr Williamson said these tests include protecting the NHS’s ability to cope, seeing the daily death rates come down, and having reliable data that shows the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Our new investigation has transformed archaeological knowledge of Roman Nazareth,” said Dr Dark, who has just published the results of his research in a new book Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and its Hinterland.“For the first time ever, we are now gaining a reasonable understanding of the sort of place Nazareth was in Roman times.”By examining in detail all the archaeological evidence, gained from recent landscape-survey work and from a detailed re-analysis of previous excavations, we are now beginning to learn about the cultural and economic environment in which Jesus grew up,“ Dr Dark told The Independent.One of the most significant revelations to have come out of Dr Dark’s investigation is the fact that the farmers of Nazareth seem to have had a prohibition on the use of human manure as a fertiliser, in contrast to the people of Sepphoris and potentially many other areas. Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd of those who supported an extension, 64 per cent wanted the transition period to be extended “indefinitely until the crisis is resolved”, while 36 per cent wanted the transition period to be extended “for a maximum of a year”.But\u0026nbsp34 per cent of all respondents said they believed\u0026nbspministers could “balance dealing with the coronavirus outbreak whilst also giving necessary time to negotiate a full trade deal with the EU before the end of the year”.\u0026nbspWhile there was strong support among Labour and SNP voters for pushing the end of the transition period past New Year’s Eve, some 49 per cent of Leave voters also supported the measure – as well as 48 per cent of Conservative voters and 45 per cent of those who previously backed the Brexit Party.Best for Britain chief executive Naomi Smith said: “There is clear support in Scotland and other nations and regions of the UK for an extension, and the views of small ‘c’ conservative voters in our data is telling.

They’re also using mobile apps tied to payments, such as Amazon Prime Now, to place delivery or pickup orders for groceries. The Treasury Department may even let people who don’t have bank accounts receive their coronavirus relief checks via mobile-payment services like Venmo.“We shouldn’t be touching anything,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of mobile-payment research firm Crone Consulting. He expects contactless payments to grab an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of transactions at stores and ATMs as the result of the pandemic. Person-to-person services like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle should benefit as well, Mr Crone said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s easy to see why. Even with retail stores cleaning more often than ever – if they’re open at all – handling cash or touching payment keypads stands out as a major risk. With contactless pay, you link a bank account or credit card to your phone and then tap the device on a contactless reader or hover over it to trigger payment.Already, 27 per cent of US small businesses have seen an increase in customers using services like Apple Pay, according to a survey of 361 companies released in April by the Strawhecker Group and the Electronic Transactions Association. Publix Super Markets sped up its transition to contactless terminals because of Covid-19, according to the company. Starting in early April, consumers at all Publix stores have been able to use services like Apple Pay and Google Pay to check out.“I know a lot of merchants are putting signage up at the point of sale, ‘Please use contactless’,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, a Mastercard executive who works with banks and credit unions.Burger King released a commercial in March to encourage customers to use an order-ahead app to pay at drive-thrus.A couple of weeks ago, retail giant Walmart Inc. tweaked its self-checkout system to go completely contactless when shoppers use Walmart Pay. Previously, you had to touch a “Pay now” button after scanning your groceries. Now, you can read a QR code with your phone to pay. Use of pickup and delivery at Walmart is growing as well.A million doses of coronavirus vaccine could be available by September“You are seeing customers start to use services they weren’t interested in before,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman.Many sellers at farmers’ markets have stopped accepting cash, and are instead using apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. The app got it started as a way for friends to reimburse each other for dinner or for roommates to handle rent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some are buying items in bulk for the whole neighbourhood and then using Zelle to collect payments. Others are sending cash gifts to relatives for their birthdays.“People don’t want to handle cash, especially at this time, so they are looking to mobile payments as the b,est alternatives,” Ms Fintland said.That said, the coronavirus shutdown has hurt some types of mobile payment services and forced others to adjust.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastToast Inc., which makes management systems for restaurants, laid off half its staff in April. Earlier this week, Grubhub pulled its 2020 guidance, largely because of the acute situation in New York, where many restaurants have closed. Companies that serve ride-sharing companies, like Stripe and Adyen, may also suffer as usage declines.The industry’s established players are also facing new competition. In March, portable-reader heavyweight Square Inc. rolled out ways for its restaurant owners to offer pickup and delivery options.“We’ve seen so many folks pivoting to online to keep their businesses going,” said Katie Dally, a Square spokeswoman. Independent booksellers and other businesses are offering pickup and delivery too, she said.As more people embrace contactless technology and get used to paying that way, consumer behaviour is going to change for good, experts say.The rush delivery service at supermarket chain Safeway hit 670,000 weekly active US mobile users the week of 29 March, up from fewer than 50,000 in the week of 1 March, according to the analytics platform App Annie. Amazon Prime Now’s Android and iPhone active user base grew 60 per cent, according to App Annie.“It’s behaviour that’s going to stick after stay at home ends,” said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. “There will be muscle memory about paying, and consumers will use it going around their daily life.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

morepork owl chicks have become the first in more than a decade to survive in Norfolk Island’s national park.There are only about 45 to 50 of the birds left in the world, and researchers and park staff were said to be “ecstatic” when the chicks were discovered.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDr James Findlay, director of Australia’s national parks, said the find marked a significant step in the recovery of the morepork owl population on the tiny island in the Pacific Ocean.He said: “I’d like to congratulate Parks Australia staff, Norfolk Island community members and researchers for their incredible work over the years to rebuild the population of this very rare bird.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with

University.“The health of the new birds continues to be assessed and a very close eye will be kept on them as they grow and reach full maturity.”Staff at Norfolk Island national park have worked closely with the Norfolk Island community and researchers for more than 40 years to help the species recover.Their work began in the 1980s when the population declined to a single female.In 1989, she was successfully paired with one of two male owls from a New Zealand subspecies.The cross-Tasman relations meant that all subsequent generations of moreporks on Norfolk Island were now a unique hybrid of the Norfolk Island and New Zealand morepork owls.Dr Sally Box, Australia’s threatened species commissioner, said the Norfolk Island morepork owl was one of 20 priority birds targeted for recovery under the Australian government’s threatened species strategy.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is the country hardest hit by coronavirus in the Middle East, with at least 5,118 people reportedly killed by Covid-19 and at least 82,000 confirmed infections that have led to quarantine measures and a shuttering of public and commercial life like those in the west. Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastBut the shutdown of business activity has damaged an economy already in deep recession because of low oil prices, harsh United States sanctions, and persistent incompetence and corruption.\u0026nbsp“Social distancing in poor\u0026nbspcountries can cause death due to starvation, too,” said\u0026nbspNassim\u0026nbspAssefi, a global health physician who has worked in Iran.Iran finds itself facing the same pressures as leaders in much of the world, attempting to balance a growing clamour from the public to resume economic life with recommendations of health and public officials warning that while the peak of the pandemic had been reached, a resurgence of the virus is likely if social distancing measures were eased too soon. \u0026nbsp“We are concerned about another outbreak in Tehran,” Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani, chairman of the capital’s municipal council, was quoted as saying.Health experts have pointed to the resurgence of infections in Asian cities that may have lifted restrictions too early. “I think it’s premature,” said Arin Balalian, an epidemiologist of Iranian descent at Columbia University. “It\u0026nbspcarries a substantial risk for the disease to come back. You are going to have shoppers and labourers, and all of them are going to use public transport, which increases the risk of transmission.”Some researchers caution that Iran’s actual numbers of dead and infected may be far higher than those promulgated by a government with a long track record of opacity and distortion.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Physicians inside the country have also noted an improvement in conditions at Iranian hospitals in recent weeks as authorities imposed stringent lockdown measures.\u0026nbspIran’s economy is in shambles. It shrank an estimated 8.7 per cent last year, with the official unemployment rate expected to rise to 13.5 per cent this year. Thanks to US\u0026nbsppressure, Iran has reportedly been denied a $5bn\u0026nbsp(£4bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund that it had requested, adding to pressure on Iranian authorities.\u0026nbspIran began allowing what it described as low-risk businesses such as offices to reopen last weekend throughout the country and on Saturday in the capital Tehran, leading to massive traffic jams, large crowds in metro stations, and queues to apply for $238 (£190) loans offered by the government.On Friday an Army Day parade was held, with officers maintaining social distancing measures as they marched in formation at a base in Tehran while displaying disinfectant trucks used to clean streets of potential coronavirus instead of tanks and jeeps.\u0026nbspDespite the partial reopening, the number of cases and deaths did not spike, according to officials. “Our assessment is that people cooperated with us and businessmen, too, observed the protocols, one of the signs of which is that we have not had an increase in the number of citizens infected,” Mr Rouhani said.But Iranian and international health officials have warned that it could take up two weeks for a surge in cases to be detected, with many coronavirus carriers either asymptomatic or suffering from relatively mild symptoms while continuing to spread the airborne pathogen. “To get from\u0026nbspexposure to\u0026nbspsymptoms takes four or five days,” said Ms Assefi. “You’re not going\u0026nbspto see death rates or even severe infections for up to weeks after easing distancing.”Nonetheless, Mr Rouhani was upbeat,\u0026nbspurging\u0026nbspbusiness leaders to launch construction and development projects to increase employment and restart the economy.Many coronavirus containment measures will remain in place. Schools will remain closed, with distance-learning in place classes have been extended for an additional four to six weeks into the summer.\u0026nbspMr Rouhani announced that all shops must close by 6pm and warned that the opening of businesses at malls, bazaars and shopping areas did not include gyms or restaurants, which he described as high risk.“If there is a shopping mall with a high-risk business, for example, a restaurant or a teahouse, but people gather there, those high-risk businesses will be closed again,” he said.\u0026nbsp“They can do takeaway. But people cannot sit in restaurants and have food.”\u0026nbspMr Rouhani said professional conferences, training workshops or academic seminars would continue to be banned, along with any kind of public gatherings whether for “happy or sad” occasions.\u0026nbsp“This is a gradual move,” he said. “Any step we take the health practitioners will scrutinise them constantly. If they see a problem arising we will for sure reverse our decision.”To contain the potential spread of coronavirus at prisons, Iran has also extended for at least a month a leave it has granted tens of thousands of detainees, including the British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.The partial reopening of the country to commerce comes ahead of the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a time of frequent religious gatherings, and festive iftar meals marking the end of daily dusk-to-dawn fasts. But Mr Rouhani announced a continued ban on religious gatherings, including group iftars, for at least the next two weeks.“During Ramadan people go to the mosques more than usual,” he said. “We urge people to hold inidual prayers rather than group ones. God will listen to people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Wear an apron instead – that will be the new policy for the foreseeable future, though the medical organisations will go mad about that.At least  NHS and healthcare workers have so far died from coronavirus, with many families blaming a lack of PPE.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told yesterdays briefing: They should be assured we are doing everything we can correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.When pressed on the issue, Mr Jenrick added: Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment, and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line, but they should be assured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.He added: My assessment is that most trusts will be out of stock after the weekend on current consumption.A sustainable level of gowns will not be reached until mid-June, told the Independent reported.Panicked ministers have drafted in the boss of the  London Olympics to be a PPE czar.Lord Paul Deighton will take charge of scaling up production and co-ordinating distribution.Top-end firms including Burberry, Barbour, Louis Vuitton and Philip Treacy have all said their manufacturing equipment could be used in the effort.Shadow health minister Justin Madders said the number of key workers still without protective equipment was a scandal.Workers have been sounding the alarm for weeks now and the Government has had months to put things in place, he said.It is outrageous that supplies keep running so low, protecting those staff who are risking their lives every time they go to work should be an absolute priority.Ministers need to make good on their promises, sort out the supply issues and work to make sure no staff member feels unsafe because of a lack of PPE. It is no good making grand promisesthey later turn out to be undeliverable.On Friday Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned the UK was tight on gowns.He added: I would love to be able to wave a magic wand and have PPE fall from the sky in large quantities and be able to answer your question about when shortages will be resolved.But given that we have a global situation in which there is less PPE in the world than the world needs, obviously it’s going to be a huge pressure point.The Royal College of Nursing said half of nursing staff, including those in the most high-risk environments, have felt pressured into working without proper PPE.They are reusing kit, are short of alcohol rub and wearing eye protection they have bought or made at home.Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: These figures unmask the gut-wrenching shortages nursing staff are dealing with in all health care settings.It is little wonder they are in such fear for their own safety and that of their patients.This crisis is taking the lives of nursing staff, and their colleagues feel they’ve been left exposed.All decision makers involved here need to get an urgent grip on the situation.Nursing staff just want to do their jobs – they must be given protection in order to do so. In response, The Department of Health said: We are working round the clock given the global shortage of gowns and other PPE to secure the NHS and the social care sector the equipment they need.New clinical advice has been issued today to make sure thatthere are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk.This has been reviewed by the Health and Safety Executive, and is in line with WHO and CDC guidance on PPE use in exceptional circumstances.There is a  hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report shortages in supply and it is crucial the relevant guidance for protective equipment is followed closely. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" There are three main options that can be considered as alternativesgowns are not available:·        Reserve disposable, fluid repellent gown  coveralls for AGPs and surgical procedures·        Disposable, non-fluid repellent gowns  coveralls with a disposable plastic apron for high-risk settings and AGPs with forearm washing once gown  coverall is removed·        Reusablesurgical gowns  coveralls or similar suitable clothingwith a disposable plastic apron for AGPs and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown  coverall is removed.

careers education service SPRINGPOD, also found that of those who attended university, one in six said their course did not correlate to the career they wish to pursue.A third even said they would now reconsider their choice of degree.When it comes to preferred careers, Britain is set for a boom in scientists – after that came out as the top choice for young jobseekers.Treading the boards as an

on in the same career as their parents.And despite some youngsters being steadfast in their career aspirations, many found contacts, geography, and debt among the barriers to getting them the job.A fth also said they feel like a lack of real-le connections in their chosen industry will hinder their chances, while one in six said living in the ‘wrong’ place could scupper them.The same number also felt like there were not enough opportunities to get into the business.But just two per cent see social class as a potential barrier.The study, carried out via OnePoll also revealed a money-savvy one

at least £,.The former Secretary of State for Education and Science, and patron of SPRINGPOD, Lord Baker said: I have seen first-hand the impact that employers and influential role models can have on

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public.

I tried to look at the process of civil action but we’re talking about the church here - which is cash rich.”Silvia decided to post a video on social media highlighting the problem, and naming and shaming the church.Furious Facebook users bombarded the church and diocese with messages - including one devoted worshipper who said she would never attend the church again after  years.Just  hours later, officials from the Diocese of Westminster moved the pots and apologised to the couple.A relieved Cengiz said afterwards in a second video “let there be light!”He added: “We have no idea the impact it would have. We had so many messages and emails, private messages and emails, and we had lawyers - two retired lawyers messaged us to say they were so angry about this and could they help us get this resolved.“The following day I had been for a run and as I came back I saw some people knocking on the church door - they were all priests.“One recognised me from the video and he came towards me and seemed lost for words. He just said ‘we’re so sorry, we’re going to move these pots out the way for now.“He said he had been sent down by his boss and the diocese of Westminster and said ‘ we are so sorry you have had this for over a year.’“It wasn’t the impact we expected. They were built deliberately to size and they’re really heavy.“Its so weird but the next day was the first time in over a year we didn’t have to turn the lights.“It was upsetting because you don’t think you’re going to buy an apartment and have your light taken away by the church of all people.”The Sacred Heart Church and The Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster have been contacted for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jenny Harries defended the governmentaposs approach, saying the plan was very clear. So far, , people have died in hospital from the disease, with many more thought to have died at home or in care homes. Boris Johnson has faced mounting pressure over the early days of the outbreak.He did not attend the first five Cobra meetings on Covid-, and his government has been accused of responding to the pandemic too slowly.Asked about the Prime Minister missing Cobra meetings, Mr Williamson said: The Prime Minister from the moment that it became clear that there were challenges in terms of coronavirus developing in China has absolutely been leading our nationaposs effort to combat the coronavirus, making sure that resources or money is not a concern for any department, especially the health service.He added that many Cobra meetings are led by the departmental minister. He said: The focus the Prime Minister was putting on this and has continued to put on this has meant that this is the whole Government effort. Speaking at the daily Covid- briefing, Dr Harries said: We had and we still have a very clear plan - we had a containment phase and it was very successful. We had very strict quarantine regimes from high-risk areas, we followed up inidual cases and families wherever that was possible. But once you end up with seeding and cases across the community, our focus has to be on managing the clinical conditions of those iniduals. And she cautioned against comparing UK figures with Germany, adding: We are at dferent phases of the pandemic.  Dr Harries declined to say whether the UK had passed the peak of the virus. She said: I would be very tempted to offer a comment on that today but Iaposm not going to be, for a number of reasons. She identied that the low number of deaths recorded today was positive but cautioned against reading too much into the figures, which are often retrospectively revised. She said: We could jump to all sorts of positive conclusions about that, but we shouldnapost. I do think it is fair to say that we do know from the hospital data that we are starting to plateau across. But she added: If we donapost keep doing the social distancing, we will create a second peak and we definitely wonapost be past it, so this is no reason to consider that we have managed this.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBright canvases fill the walls, paint pots and crayons scatter the tables and a cat called Pablo Picasso is curled up sleeping in a corner. Louise Allen’s colourful, bohemian home is an homage to all things artistic. The -year-old is an illustrator, artist and author, her husband Lloyd, , is a graphic designer, and their two sons aged  and  are named Jacksonand Vincent . Surprisingly, however, Louise’s passion for beautul things came about because of her exposure to ugly abuse as a child. And now, as a foster parent, she uses the healing power of art to benefit the vulnerable children in her care. ‘Art was the one thing that saved me throughout a very dficult childhood,’ explains Louise, who lives in Somerset. ‘When I had no words to express myself, I found real comfort in drawing and creating things. Often shame and trauma are hard to vocalise. But pictures can be a powerful way to help children communicate.’ Louise – whose real mum was an unmarried teenager – was adopted in  and grew up in Oxford. But her adoptive mother was cruel. Louise was starved, forced to scavenge for food and eat dirt, punished with ice baths, and frequently hit. The only respite in her otherwise miserable childhood and adolescence was art. ‘At school we were asked to make a family tree for a project,’ recalls Louise. ‘Well, I knew I was adopted and mine would not be the neat chart on a piece of A paper that my peers would produce. So instead I painted a huge ft tree with branches and leaves for the teacher. Amazingly, I was told my efforts had earned me a trip to the Tate in London. ‘Being in that gallery, seeing all these beautul pictures, was an eye-opening, le-changing experience. Standing next to them gave me a sense of value. They were important and admired, and being in that environment made me have more self worth by proximity.’ After that, Louise – who suffers from dyslexia and dyscalculia, and constantly felt ‘thick’ – began bunking off school. Not to hang out at McDonald’s like other kids her age, but to educate herself about art with trips at her local Ashmolean Museum.  Eventually, at , unable to cope with her cruel adoptive mother’s bullying, Louise ran away to the coast with a boyfriend. She worked as a waitress and barmaid saving every penny until she won a place at Portsmouth School of Art. ‘Le changed completely from then,’ smiles Louise, who ended up teaching and lecturing at the art school for more than  years. It was also where she met her future husband, Lloyd. As students in the s they were just mates, but re-met and fell in love in  and married three years later. It was seven years ago, in , when the family decided to start fostering children. ‘It was time to give something back to society. I knew I could relate to vulnerable children after my own experience of trauma, neglect and abuse.’ Louise, who is currently fostering two girls of  and nine, has now looked after  children in total, some of whom have stayed with her for five years and are very much part of the family. Louise’s calm, caring presence and natural warmth help youngsters feel comfortable coming into the family home. ‘I give all the children who come here a proper sketchbook and pens and pencils. Often they can communicate much better with pictures and images. Children who have suffered abuse will say whatever they think an adult wants to hear, that’s a survival instinct. ‘It’s what I used to do. But they can draw things that they may not have the words for, the images they produce can be so insightful.’  One of the first girls Louise cared for, Stella, was helped to communicate through art. ‘Stella came to me aged five, a tiny bird-like little thing. Her wild, teenage mum Shannon had named her after a can of lager. Her dad was a low-level drug dealer. She bounced between them all and then, with the misguided support of a social worker, Stella ended up back in Shannon’s care.’ Stella’s school teacher noticed she behaved inappropriately when getting undressed for PE, and had bruises. They alerted the authorities and the little girl was found abandoned in a deserted house with no food, water, clothes or warmth. With the security and love of Louise’s family, Stella made good progress. One of the first times the foster mum encouraged Stella to express herself with crayons and paper, her simple drawings were heartbreaking. ‘I could quite easily tell there was her mum, and then there was a group of men with spiky hair and sharp teeth,’ describes Louise. ‘Stella had drawn them all with these big penises. ‘Shannon had pimped out her daughter for drug money. I crouched down next to her and said, “Thank you for showing me”. Stella didn’t have the language at that time but she wanted to share that information with me.’  But there were more shocking insights of Stella’s abuse to come. ‘One day I lined up the kids in the garden to have their picture taken, I said, “Say cheese!” and Stella’s immediate response was to throw herself to the floor, take her knickers off and open her legs.’ Sickeningly, poor Stella had been frequently coerced into performing sex acts for the camera. ‘It shocked me to the core, I felt like screaming inside,’ admits Louise. ‘But when things like this happen, you have to stay calm, put the child’s feelings first, don’t make a big deal. Then try to make sure they don’t do it again. aposI generally put Stella in trousers after that, and when I took her to the beach I dressed her in a one-piece to eliminate her taking her pants off, which she had been taught to do. You have to be pragmatic as a carer.’ Another time, Stella had a violent reaction to a Lion bar Louise had provided for a garden picnic. Unbeknown to the foster mum, it was the same brand of chocolate the little girl had always been awarded by Shannon as a ‘treat’ after she had been subjected to vile sexual abuse. ‘She began shaking and ran off and hid behind the shrubs,’ says Louise. ‘Sadly child abuse victims commonly get treated with sweets.’ Another time, Stella was happily playing when – asshe had been taken over by an alien – she began screaming a stream of graphic sexual swear words, replaying some of the terrible things that had happened to her. ‘I gently shooed the other children away so they couldn’t hear and then I stayed with Stella, made her feel safe and loved while she calmed down.’ Stella’s tragic abuse and exploitation could not simply be solved by colouring or crayons, of course. Louise explains that a wonderfully sympathetic policewoman, and other healthcare professionals all became involved.  But there is no doubt the hours spent quietly painting and drawing in Louise’s calm, non-judgemental company, organically opened up conversations. And became an important part of the healing process. Happily, Stella’s story ends well. Aged six, she was adopted by Danny, who was already a loving dad to three other adopted children. ‘When a single middle-aged man said he would adopt Stella I was full of suspicion and concern,’ admits Louise. ‘But Danny is delightful, he set up an engineering company when he was much younger and made a lot of money, and wanted to do something worthwhile with his le.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAcross the country, children have been stuck in their family homes for weeks. Away from friends and school, this new way of le is taking its toll on their mental health. A survey commissioned by children’s charity World Vision has shown one in three British children aged five to   have told parents they are lonely since schools shut. And unsurprisingly almost a third of parents have noticed negative changes in children’s behaviour since lockdown – including tantrums, meltdowns, nightmares, tummy ache, fighting and crying. Daniela Buzducea, from World Vision, says the global pandemic is having a serious impact, leaving some children frightened, insecure and isolated. So how can parents look after their youngsters’ mental health in these stay-at-home days  Daniela says: “Parents can give children emotional support, reduce stress levels, and help them feel safe. It’s important to find out what children have heard about the pandemic and listen to their concerns. Parents should talk calmly and explain in a way appropriate to their child’s level of understanding. “It may be easier for young children to draw a picture rather than talk about something scary. Offer them crayons and paper.” Here are more ways to support your children through the lockdown.  Explain it Child psychologist Dr Alicia Drummond, author of Teen Tips, runs a podcast aimed at helping parents cope in isolation. She suggests finding a quiet moment to talk honestly with your children, whatever their age. “Recognise this is a challenging time. Tell them it is a serious situation, but it won’t last forever,” she says. Young children may not understand why birthday parties and family outings have been cancelled. Or they might worry about parents or grandparents catching the virus. Discuss with your children how your family is doing everything it can to minimise the risks such as washing their hands and social distancing. Encourage them to keep in touch with grandparents and other family members online. Make sure you don’t have the news on all the time. Constant updates can feel overwhelming and even the youngest kids pick up on the anxiety of adults.  Discover their worries Dr Peter Fuggle, clinical psychologist at the child mental health research Anna Freud Centre, says for children aged three to seven, playing together may be the best way to find out what is worrying your child. Often the games children play are based on what they are thinking. There are a host of programmes and initiatives to help young kids understand the current situation. Sesame Street has launched a new website Caring For Each Other , while Sky Kids has introduced virtual playdates. Dr Emma Maynard, psychologist and senior lecturer in education at University of Portsmouth, says younger children, mainly those under seven, need plenty of reassurance. “If you are self-isolating and cannot hug them, let them hold their favourite teddies and toys for as long as they want.” Maynard also suggests putting hug tokens in a jar for cashing in after isolation. This also works for teenagers who have missed out on some key celebrations. By postponing them until autumn or even next year, it reminds them we will not be in lockdown forever.  Stick to routines Structure is important for kids of all ages as is regular exercise. “Routine is very reassuring for children. Stick to regular mealtimes and bedtimes. It’s important to eat well and sleep well, and routine also helps the day pass more quickly,” says Dr Maynard. “Family playtime is also important in isolation and children learn every time they play.” While some families have embraced home schooling with fixed timetables of lessons, don’t worryit doesn’t work for your family. “It might be better to have a more gentle, sustainable work and play routine that can be maintained over time,” says Dr Maynard. Stay creative Now that we are spending more time together we need to keep our routine creative. For older children showing heightened anxiety, try Headspace for Kids . Its series of guided meditations are designed to help calm children down and focus their minds.For seven to -year-olds, there are numerous online resources reached through a simple google search. Bear Grylls has teamed up with the Scouts organisation to launch the Great Indoors to provide fun inside activities. Strictly’s Oti Mabuse is running dance classes and David Walliams is reading his children’s books online. For more ideas try artfulparent for craft activities, littlecooks for baking courses and cosmickids for online yoga. Teenagers can join Club Quarantine’s DJ D-Nice on Friday nights, -pm on Instagram live, as an alternative to going out. Space to chill If you are getting cabin fever staying at home, Dr Alicia Drummond’s suggests making a quiet corner where kids can take time out. If your children are squabbling and driving you to distraction, take yourself off to the quiet area instead. If you can, create a separate space in your home for learning and relaxation. Butthat’s not possible, then make sure you pack away school work once the day is done. Stay connected The most important part of staying healthy during this period of isolation is staying in touch. “Staying connected is important for safeguarding our children’s mental health through the lockdown,” says Dr Maynard.“Encourage your children to chat with friends using Google Hangouts or Zoom.”But while social media plays a part in helping our children stay sociable, it is also a good idea to have a time and place to connect that is offline. Go for a walk near your house or build a denyou have access to a garden. Woodlandtrust.org.uk has produced a list of nature activities children can do at home and the Happy Little Farmer App has great ideas to encourage children to get into gardening.

The UK government has issued advice for the public relating to the transmission of the potentially deadly bug on food. The guidance states that it is very unlikely that you can catch coronavirus from food because respiratory illnesses are not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging, reports  North Wales Live. The Food Standards Agency gave a similar statement earlier this month. Anyone concerned about the potential contamination of coronavirus on their food however has been assured in the new guidance that, evenit was present on food, cooking thoroughly will kill the virus. The advice also urges the public to wash their hands regularly with soap and water - as has been recommended by the NHS since the beginning of the outbreak - particularly before handling food or eating. The new information stresses that the risk of coronavirus cross-contamination on food and packaging is very low.  It urges that food businesses must adhere to hygiene and safety procedures, and that staff in the industry are required to maintain a high degree of personal cleanliness and wear suitable, clean clothing. Providing advice to the public themselves, the document explains: When you are buying loose foods such as fruit, vegetables, or bread in a bakery, try and only touch what you are going to buy. Customers are also reminded that they must maintain a two metre distance between themselves and others, and only buy what you need. As mentioned previously, officials urge the public to follow general hygiene procedures when handling food - particularly in relation to raw fruit, leafy salads and vegetables.  This includes washing fresh produce to help remove any contamination on the surface and peeling outer layers of certain items. The public are however warned not to wash raw chicken or other meat as this can lead to cross-contamination in the kitchen. Additionally, the new guidance recommends using a food-safe disinfectant when cleaning surfaces - suggesting that using hot, soapy water is a suitable alternativecleaning products are in limited supply locally. The UK Government adds: If you have been shopping, there should be no need to sanitise the outer packaging of food. This is because food businesses are required to have a system for managing food safety in place, which should include keeping packaging clean. You should still follow good hygiene practice by washing your hands after handling any outer packaging. The advice says takeaway orders are not prohibited or considered particularly unsafe.

Turn your gaze skyward out your windows or grab a blanket and set up the deckchairs outdoors at your home to take in the spectacular lightshow. Anywhere from ten to hundreds of meteors an hour are predicted to glitter across the Northern Hemisphereaposs night skies this week. The annual meteor shower is expected to peak on Tuesday night and the best viewing time is just before dawn on Wednesday. Hereaposs some tips on taking in the dazzling phenomenon safely during the national coronavirus lockdown. What is the Lyrid Meteor Shower and when can you see it  The spectacular light shower is already underway but will be most visible in the United Kingdom and the United States early this week. Experts say the peak viewing time will be late Tuesday night and into the early hours of Wednesday, with observations are affected by the phases of the moon and local weather conditions. The Lyrid Meteor Shower occurs every April - putting on a spectacular light-show for stargazers. Shooting stars appear as dust from the Comet C  G Thatcher and interact with the Earth’s atmosphere. When this dust enters Earth’s atmosphere, it burns up, producing a trail of light through the sky. It takes its name from the Lyra constellation, from which the meteors appear to radiate. While it is due to start tonight, the peak of the Lyrid meteor shower will be overnight on April -, NASA meteor expert Bill Cooke told Space. The Lyrids will be visible beginning at about :pm, but are best viewed in the darkness after midnight and when urban lights have been switched off as households turn in for bed. The best time to watch is after midnight and before the light of dawn, the expert said. Check the weather forecast in your area to determine the prime time overnight to skygaze. The phenomenonaposs peak visibility time of Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning is due to the phase of the moon. It will be a thin crescent only about two days from the new moon at that time, Mr Cooke said, so the moonlight wonapost drown out the light-show. Visibility will depend on how clear and dark the night sky where you live is, Cooke said.  The expert said the average Lyrid shower produces  to  meteors per hour, and this year about  per hour are predicted - although sometimes hundreds an hour can be seen tearing across the skies. Some years, the Lyrid meteor shower can produce up to  meteors per hour in whataposs called an outburst, but it is hard to predict, Mr Cooke added. There is an average of  years between the outbursts, but the actual number of years between them ies, he said. How best to view the meteor shower during the UK lockdown The spectacular could not have come at a better time for the UK in lockdown. As we stay home to protect the NHS and stop spreading the coronavirus, those of us who are not key workers on shts should be in the perfect spot to catch the light-show. Normally, eager stargazers are urged to head to the countryside where there is less light pollution to see the meteors in all their glory. However under lockdown rules, you must not travel to the countryside.

The powerful look was down to an Emilia Wickstead dress, teamed with a matching hat and shoes - perfect for the Commonwealth Day Service with the rest of the Royal Family. But Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, believes there was a lot more to the outfit than just a stylish fashion moment. She thinks Meghan was sending a clear message to designer Wickstead and to people who believe the two women have a complicated relationship. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: One of the most iconic looks is going to be her green Emilia Wickstead cape dress. That cape blowing in the wind as she walked into the church and then walked out of the church, which was such an emotional moment for so many people as it was their last formal engagement as royals. That green dress will stand out in history books I think. She goes on to explain the complicated story between Meghan and Wickstead, which came from an interview the designer did with a magazine.  Christine says that Wickstead described Meghanaposs wedding dress as simple, and taken out of context in other reports left many believing she was criticising the dress. She said: It was a pull quote from a larger interview, she really didnapost say anything negative. People thought Emilia Wickstead had really wronged Meghan, and it turned out that Emilia Wickstead hadnapost wrong Meghan, it was a pull quote.  Maybe a month or so later Meghan actually wore a custom Emilia Wickstead dress, and that situation shows the power of Meghanaposs fashion choices. She was able to say with this fashion choice, Emilia Wickstead and I are great. Weaposre on great terms, that whole thing was a huge misunderstanding and look at the lovely dress she designed for me. Emilia Wickstead is a popular British designed and is a favourite of Meghanaposs sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge.  Christine added: To chose Emilia Wickstead for that design, someone who is iconically British and so iconically royal as well, I think was very, very well thought out. I think that vision of Meghan walking back towards the car with the cape blowing in the wind, it can make you quite emotional canapost it. Christine also believes Meghanaposs first ever royal outfit sent a very clear message about how she planned to approach le in the royal spotlight. Looking back over Meghanaposs royal looks, she said: Her most memorable and most powerful message was surprisingly the one that she wore to the Invictus Games in Toronto when she was just Harryaposs girlfriend.

A total of ,kg of meat  from wild animals was seized by Border Agency staff at airports in  , up from kg the previous year and kg in  , according to a response by the Home Office to a freedom of information request made by the Daily Mirror. ild animals have been hunted by rural communities in Africa for many thousands of years, but in recent decades have been smuggled into cities in Britain, Europe and the USA – part of a lucrative international crime racket. Experts have warned that the bushmeat trade is not only a threat to wild animals but could result in more zoonotic diseases being transmitted to humans. Dr Ben Garrod, Professor of Evolutionary Biology and Science Engagement at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, warned: “While this global pandemic started in Wuhan, it is just as possible for the next one to start in London or Washington. Currently, animal meat and body parts are being illegally transported all around the world.  “Airlines and border agencies are great at stopping people, drugs and weapons from being smuggled. But here we are with something more fundamentally dangerous than any act of terrorism or natural disaster, yet it is allowed to go largely unchecked. “Until those transporting products of animal origins internationally are stopped, we are going to see primates, pangolins and other exotic, endangered animals coming into the UK, Europe, USA and Asia. Unless that stops we are going to see more epidemics and more species in decline.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nurse left breathless without taste","story":"NewsNurse left breathless and without taste or smell as she battled killer coronavirusVeteran critical care nurse Alison Riseley - who feared the worst as she battled the bug - has warned people to stay at home because \"anyone can get this, at any time\"ShareCommentsByAbigail RabbettRyan Merrield:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-deaths-uk-hospitals-rises-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news nurse-left-breathless-without-taste-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Alison Riseley, , said fighting the deadly disease was scary and she feared the worst, but was comforted by seeing so many familiar faces. The critical care nurse has been saving lives on the Covid- frontline at Royal Papworth Hospital for weeks but is fairly certain she didnapost pick up the virus there. Alison had been off work due to her asthma prior to testing positive at her local hospital but had been venturing out to collect essential medication from a pharmacy. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   “I can’t be certain where I caught coronavirus...it must have been picked up in the community rather than at the hospital, she told CambridgeshireLive. She admitted her symptoms were initially mild but came on more severe suddenly leaving her increasingly breathless and without the senses of taste or smell. After seeking medical advice I was taken to my local hospital last Thursday,” Alison explained. The veteran nurse of  years service saw her condition deteriorating rapidly and she was transferred to Royal Papworth just  hours later, where she was put on oxygen.   Having spent last weekend in the specialist heart and lung hospital’s critical care unit – the same unit in which she normally works as a sister – Alison was then discharged to a ward to complete her recovery before being allowed home on Friday. “It was so strange when I was told I was being taken to Royal Papworth, yet at the same time extremely comforting because it felt like I was coming home and knew I would be in the best hands, she said. One of my colleagues who is also a very good friend came in to look after me two nights in a row, which provided me with a lot of comfort, alongside seeing all the other familiar faces and fantastic nurses, too. “When you are a nurse you are used to looking after others and it was tough not being able to look after myself, as well as having that added insight into what might be happening and the treatment that I would need. She said she thought of her children and grandchildren with worst case scenarios running through your head at once, but is thrilled to now be back home and on the mend. “I just want to thank all staff for their excellent care and compassion, Alison continued. I am thinking of them all and sending them my love and best wishes.

The deaths may have happened over the previous two weeks and only recently been added to the total. University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust has said that over  patients had died at its hospitals since the start of the outbreak - the highest number for any trust in England. As of pm on April , the trust had announced  deaths, according to figures from NHS England. Two other trusts have announced between  and  deaths. They are London North West University Healthcare NHS Trustand the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust . The UKaposs grisly toll continued to climb this afternoon when  new deaths were confirmed in England,  in Wales,  in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. NHS England said victims were aged between  and . Six of those who died, aged between  and , had no known underlying health condition.Last week, a Nightingale hospital was opened in Birmingham to help the city tackle the coronavirus crisis.The facility is located inside the NEC exhibition centre and constructed in just eight days.

William said the temporary field hospital - - was also a wonderful example of the pulling together going on up and down the UK amid the Covid- outbreak. In a speech on Thursday, delivered via video-link because of social distancing rules, William said he was happy to be attending in digital spirit at least and later joined in remotely with a clap for carers. Their selfless commitment has touched the hearts of the entire nation.

The UK, which remains on lockdown until at least early May, will be hotter than Crete and Ibiza on Thursday and Friday, say forecasters. The Met Officeaposs Simon Partridge told theaverages for the month are currently sitting at .C above the .C average for April. The hottest ever April day was April ,  which saw parts of Britain reach .C, which is still a way above the C seen in Terknow, Cornwall on April  this year.

Itaposs been very dry. Thursdayaposs heat is likely the hottest weaposll get before the end of the month though, as the general outlook is not quite as warm for the final week. BBC meteorologist Chris Fawkes said London will see the best of the fine weather on Thursday with -C, though the likes of Birmingham, Cardf and Liverpool will all be in the s.  Thataposs warmer than it often is in July, so we are doing pretty well as far as those temperatures go, he said. And while temperatures will likely be equally as warm on Friday, Mr Fawkes admitted there will be subtle changes as weak areas of low pressure start to move closer to the UK. Itaposs probably going to stay dry for the most part on Friday, perhaps even into the weekend. But thereaposs a tendency as we head into the weekend for there being a little bit more in the way of cloud and there could be a few showers, he added. Following a chilly but clear Sunday night with - and -C forecast in parts of Scotland, Monday will see a frosty but sunny start for most, according to the Met Office. Isolated showers may appear in southwest England but the majority of Brits will enjoy sunshine, though an easterly breeze will keep it feeling cooler in some parts.

This could see schools re-open as early as May , it was claimed, with non-essential businesses not far behind. The government has since poured cold water on this, stressing that five things need to happen before restrictions can be lted.Speaking last week, First Minister Dominic Raab said that before any changes come in, the NHS needs to be able to cope, infection rates must fall, the death rate must fall, testing must be stepped up and a second peak must be avoided.But with the government under pressure to reveal what it plans to do, we look at what a traffic light strategy would involve. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here What is a apostraffic lightapos strategy This was first reported by Buzzfeed, which said sources with knowledge of Number aposs plans were giving it serious consideration.The strategy would see people go back to work at dferent times, in order to maintain social distancing. Scientists argue it would be reckless to send everyone back to work at the same time - infection rates would soar as it would be impossible to keep people far enough apart to stop the spread. But with experts predicting anything between two million and . million job losses, clearly something will have to happenthe UK isnapost to remain in lockdown indefinitely.  What would the stages be  As the name suggests, the traffic light strategy has three phases - red, amber and green. Red would be the most restrictive, with conditions being lted during the amber and finally the green stage. The red stage This would see theof non-essential shops, as well as warehouses, as long as social distancing can be maintained. Workers and customers would still be required to remain two metres apart. It would also see nurseries reopen, as well as hairdressers and barbers.  However non-essential travel would still be encouraged, and those who can work from home would still be required to do so.According to a report in The Sun, May  is being considered as a date for this to be put in place. However Michael Gove yesterday emphatically denied that the approach was being looked at, and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson posted on Twitter : No decision has been made on when we will reopen schools. The amber stage Restrictions would remain in place, but there would be a relaxing of rules when this is introduced. Small businesses with less than  employees would be allowed to reopen, schools would , and some restaurants could reopen with strict seating rules.This is doubtful however - Mr Gove yesterday said pubs and restaurants would be among the last businesses to be allowed to reopen.According to The Sun, the amber stage could be introduced on May .  The green stage This is the point at which most of the country goes back to work - albeit with a number of restrictions remaining in place. People would still be required to wear masks in public, it is reported, but weddings and funerals could be held again with larger groups. Cinemas and theatres could open their doors again, while gyms and pubs could also be back in business - with strict guidelines. The Sun suggests June  would be the day this is introduced. What needs to happen before lockdown is lted   . The NHS must be able to cope The slogan that the Government has championed from the start has been clear - Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Many of the measures put in place - including the opening of the Nightingale Hospital at the NEC in Birmingham, have been to reduce the burden that Covid- is having on the NHS. The last thing the Government wants is thousands upon thousands of patients needing medical treatment all at once, so until there is confidence that the NHS can cope, lockdown will remain in place.  . Fall in deathsThe daily death total makes for a grim reading each day, with hundreds of deaths recorded in hospitals as a result of coronavirus.And sadly, with deaths occurring in public and care facilities, the real number is almost certainly much higher. Mr Raab said the government will want to see a apossustained and consistent fall in deathsapos before any decision to lt restrictions will be made.

Lionel Vytialingam was buying food when he heard car horns and saw a small terried dog weaving in and out of traffic in Ipoh, Malaysia. He jumped in his car and followed the abandoned dog until he was able to get close enough to approach the animal. Lionel saw the dog had a soggy note attached to its collar with a rubber band, but didnapost try to retrieve it until he had gained its trust. After about  minutes, the dog plucked up the courage to approach him and Lionel carefully removed the note, while holding on to her apossticky knots of furapos, hoping it contained the owneraposs contact details or an address. Instead, he found a heartbreaking message which read: Woof! Hi! My name is Siggy and Iaposm the most loving and attentive doggy youaposll ever see. My master is very sorry he had to leave me here with you, but he just canapost look after me anymore. I am very sorry about that as Iaposm sure he is too. Please take me into your home. Please let me be part of your family. Please love me. I am a goldendoodle, I am five years old this year and I have not been neutered. I am very nice, I havenapost bitten anyone, ever! I am a good guard dog who will sit in front of your door all day, and bark at anyone who comes to your gate. Until you tell me to stop. OrI know the person very well. I can do some tricks too! I hope youaposll accept me. With love and some woof, Siggy.  The note left Lionel in tears and he decided to take the poor pup home, where he fed and bathed her, dried her off and let her sleep in a cosy bed he created under the safety of his sofa. His previously adopted dog Sammo didnapost get along with Siggy, so Lionelaposs brother is taking care of him while Lionel and Siggy stay in temporary accomodation. Lionel said: She had formed the most intense, most pleading eye contact with me from under her matted fringe. I unhooked the note, opened it up and read it right there crouched by the roadside. I broke down in tears.

The images, which were first released by state-owned China Daily newspaper in , were published again last month on Twitter before being deleted. In the pictures the seal to one of the refrigerators inside the lab appears flimsy and loose, while a lab worker dressed in gloves and a mask can be seen pulling out a box which contains virus samples. Minsters said earlier this month that there are fears the global pandemic may have started from a leak in one of the labs storing the deadly virus. It has previously been claimed that Wuhan Institute of Virology, where it is alleged coronavirus may have been leaked from, has been carrying out experiments on bats from the cave believed to be the source of the  coronavirus  pandemic. The  Mail on Sunday  reports that that the Institute has been carrying out research on bats captured from caves in Yunnan, where the Covid- genome is thought to have come from. The caves are , miles away from Wuhan, the Chinese city which is now infamous for having been the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic. Scientists say it is highly likely that Covid- first came from bats, but first passed through an intermediary animal before jumping to humans. The Wuhan lab has previously dismissed allegations that coronavirus came from their facility, while the Chinese Embassy has described speculation around the labaposs activities as hasty and reckless allegations.  Bats are believed to have responsible for six outbreaks of coronaviruses, including the Covid- pandemic, but experts insist problems only occur when people come into contact with the creatures themselves. Chinese scientist Shi Zhengli describes the Wuhan outbreak as a wake-up call for the world and work is now taking place around the globe to find a way to prevent another pandemic. She said: What we have uncovered is just the tip of an iceberg. The mission must go on. Bat-borne coronaviruses will cause more outbreaks and we must find them before they find us.

dundee fans want answers from john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed

We know how routine is important“They have three double sessions in a week and they have a combined seven sessions with the weekend off.“Each player can see what other player is doing so it becomes quite competitive as well.“We can see it as it is happening and at what level.“So we know they are sticking to the work that is given to them.”Aberdeen optioned not to furlough playing staff, although many Scottish clubs have gone down that route.Instead the players opted to take a deferral of wages and bonuses of between % and % from April  for four months.That decision was made because McInnes and the board believe the players need to be readythe season does start up again.Players are also involved in interacting with the supporters as part of the #StillStandingFree Community outreach initiative to cope with the coronavirus crisis.McInnes said: “At the minute we have an opportunity to keep on top of fitness with the players.“That is until we know when we are playing football, and hopefully that is not too long.“There is a lot of merit in keeping key members of the football staff and the players interacting.“That is the case for us at the minute, until we know exactly how the season is going to play out.“Obviously we are watching the news every day and things are looking pretty bleak.“But until we know for certain when we are expected to go back and perform then I think for now where there is still maybe a hope we can get back playing football in a couple of months.“But I do think we have to stay engaged with the players. We are still trying to keep on top of their fitness work.”If the Premiership season were to be cancelled before completion, McInnes insists the club would inevitably have to look at the possibility of furloughing players.He said: “If, and this would be a club decision, it looks like the football season is going to be pushed back then, and only then, would we really consider furloughing players.“For us to have no contact with the players and each other for two months – but we are not at that stage.“It is important we keep that dialogue going and players and ourselves all still have a role to play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

Even with thoughts of lugging heavy panniers full of day-to-day necessary detritus.Even knowing Id have to scrap with private hire drivers at junctions and dodge buses in cycle lanes.Thats a large part of the current joy. No scrapping, no narrow misses, no stress.The roads are so much emptier that the nagging fear always following at my shoulder, that heightened sense of potential doom, is gone.There are streets so quiet on my route that you can almost forget about motorised traffic and freewheel, carefree up the middle of the road. It is glorious.Even in the centre of the city the roads are largely silent. While its eerie, definitely, for the cyclist it is exciting. The roads are mine.Elsewhere, children cycle along with their parents, in that zig zaggy way little kids do, unfussed about straight lines. Older couples cycle side by side, leisurely, having a lovely time.Its not only the newfound freedom of space that makes the roads more enticing, its the lack of noise. Theres a nice silence, easy on the ears. Birdsong is more pronounced.Of course, its not all utopia. There are still idiots treating the almost empty roads as a racetrack challenge and lets hope these chumps feel the force of the law. Police forces in some parts of the UK have said the number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.But, broadly, we are being given a glimpse of what cycling cities could look like. Its being widely reported that the sales of bikes are up. Cycling Scotlands figures show that in some areas the number of cyclists has doubled or more.Other countries have seen similar increases in cycling and have seized the opportunity to make cities more bike and foot friendly. Cities in Germany are turning roads into bike lanes to help people with social distancing.Road layouts have been adapted with relative ease using removable tape and mobile signs. The redesign of urban spaces helps everyone as it takes pressure off parks as people take their exercise on the roads, and gives more space to pedestrians trying to keep their two metre distance by stepping into the road.London is also looking at repurposing space on its busiest roads to make more room for cyclists and pedestrians. This is the perfect time for Scotland to do the same.There will be plenty of people tempted by cycling but who are afraid of going on the roads, given how congested they usually are.Novice cyclists are not now competing with as much traffic and so its the perfect time to gain confidence, find routes that work for them and develop a healthy habit that they wont want to kick when the lockdown lts.It also plans to reduce speed limits across the city. Were seeing, right now, what a car free city centre could look like. And its pretty glorious, as long as we have the public transport network to support it.Could we also introduce reduced speed limits  Cycling is a safe mode of transport - the danger comes from external forces and, even in lockdown, drivers are still putting their foot down and making roads less safe. If we could further curb that with an increase in mph zones, what a dference it would make to the feel of the roads.Deep rooted health inequalities dont go away during lockdown people still have diseases linked with inactivity.Cars destroy health - at an inidual and societal level. They destroy the environment.There are so many sound and sensible reasons for pushing active travel and cutting car use - we know them well already.The dference now is that this is such an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of lightening the vehicular load on our roads.The means of creating wider pavements and segregated cycle lanes are easy to do, simple toto normal when lockdown lts. This, though, is a point for and a point against.Its hard to argue against simple, easily reversible measures. But when the pandemic is over we want to keep people using active travel. Hopefully, having had so many more people using cycling as a means of getting around, there will be wider support for current cycling strategies.Maybe there will be a push to take them further.It would be a great shame to see the current enthusiasm for cycling wane as lockdown is lted.It is joyous to see families cycling together, couples out on the roads, novice cyclists confidently owning the tarmac - all with reduced fear of vehicles.It is joyous to cycle fear-free down the middle of a road. It is a boost to mental and physical health, the fresh air, the bird song, the pure pleasure of physically activity.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance. Thatrsquos the common theme.The Unremembered Places by Patrick Baker is published by Birlinn on May "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  an army at work on the home front","story":"It wasnrsquot until we moved to the country that I needed a diary the way fish need water. We got the keys to the cottage on a brilliantly frosty Friday and moved our belongings in over the weekend. Until then, wersquod forgotten that we had nothing to sleep on. Two nights in a nearby hotel was our last experience of domestic warmth for many months to come. A mattress was delivered on the Monday, which was also the day the first tradespeople arrived, to measure for shutters. With Christmas looming, we needed to put things in place as fast as possible, ahead of the long festive shutdown or, as that chapter in our memoirs will read, The Big Freeze.It would be quicker to tell you who hasnrsquot been over the door these past two years. Thanks to ill-fitting windows, draughty doors, a leaking roof, and a central heating system suffering from poor circulation, for the first three months I worked in the kitchen, as close to the boiler as I could get. Some books are kept under wraps until the day of publication, but the one I was battling with was typed from beneath layers of thermals, wool and eiderdown, with a hot water bottle on my lap where once there had been a cat.The extent of our igloo-like crisis was brought home the day we stood in front of the French windows, discussing triple glazing with the man from Everest. His breath and ours met as we spoke, sending up a mushroom cloud above the packing boxes. Snow fell steadily outside, blown sideways by a gale, like a film directorrsquos idea of a backwoods scene. Somehow it also managed to get inside, through the jambs. At this point the comparison with an igloo, which is better built and insulated, collapses.In the months since, we feel aswersquove got to know half of the Bordersrsquo tradesmen. Each week the diary has been stuffed with appointments, as we set about tackling all our problems, some immediately evident, others only making themselves known after stormy weather or excavation.The local economy must surely have taken an upturn since we arrived. Diary entries from the week we arrived to the Friday before lockdown began show that we have had window fitters, joiners , plumbers, heating engineers, roofers, painters, locksmiths, glaziers, IT experts, telephone engineer, loft insulators, pest controller, kitchen fitters, electricians, wood-burning stove suppliers, carpet cleaners, carpet layers, stone masons, carpenters, plasterers, chimney sweep, fencers, drystone dykers, and a landscape gardener, all contributing to the home front.We even had a man with a scythe to tackle the so-called lawn which, after a fortnightrsquos absence in the first springtime, had turned into a waist-high meadow. After that he came every two weeks with his Rolls-Royce of a lawnmower and extendable shears, to keep the ancient beech hedge under control. Hisevery spring after the long winter is a bright spot on the calendar.Men ndash and apart from one Polish window fitter and a locksmith who replaced several door latches they have all been men ndash have inspected the chimneys by binoculars and ladder, crept into the crawl space under the roof with torch in mouth, and delved beneath floors in an attempt to trace the labyrinth of pipes. Irsquove seen the original th-century lath and plasterwork exposed in the kitchen, and been shown a field drain predating the cottage at the front. The old cart house at the back, which later became a cobblerrsquos, was reached by a flagged path, and remnants of this, which had served for  years and more, were exposed when our tumbledown old wall was rebuilt. That would explain why, previously, whenever Alan attempted to drive a spade into this part of the garden he would shudder ashersquod had an electric shock.Clearing the front flowerbed a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out a long-buried rubber pipe, perished with age, which disappeared, goodness knows where, under the Buddleia. While I was tugging, Alan came upon a smooth oval stone, so hefty he could barely budge it. It was either the mould for a giant Easter egg, or the first rugby ball in the Borders.If there is one common factor with the army that has worked on the house, it is rugby. An astonishing number of tradesmen are either players or former players. All but a very few are avid followers. One chap was undergoing treatment for his latest injuries when he first turned up, having on earlier occasions broken his back and a leg at play. He was clearly in a lot of pain but, several months and many injections later, he was finally fit to rejoin his team.Give how physical their work is, you can see why so many of them are sportsmen. There was one young man who, unbeknownst to us, was clambering around our rooftop without any sign of a harness, nearly giving our neighbour across the green palpitations. For the space of five days while he worked, the front door stood wide open ndash it was January ndash but when I askedthe cold bothered him, he said he liked it. He never put the heating on in his flat.Two months later, in the wake of the Beast from the East, the kitchen was installed and the door stood ajar for a further five days. This time I had to work upstairs, typing in rhythm to the bass beat on the joinerrsquos radio, and thereby generating a frisson of heat. He too seemed not to notice the Arctic blast. All of them seem exceptionally tough and strong.

Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis. Whip the double cream until soft peaks form and then spoon the cream onto the pavlova and then dress with the strawberry mixture."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown-recipe-umi-edinburgh-teriyaki-salmon-plus-use-chopsticks","story":"Umi was opened with the aim of bringing authentic Japanese ramen to Scotlandrsquos capital ndash they believe ramen can bring joy and happiness to a dinerrsquos day.Red paper lanterns, horigotatsu tables with cushions, shoji doors, rattan chairs and murals reflecting the Japanese street scene create a traditional, immersive and bustling atmosphere.

This coming Friday, at .pm on the dot, around  fans from all over the world will be logging in to join a virtual tasting by one of the greatest bottlers of them all ndash Adelphi.If you know whisky, that one world will have made you stop and take notice. If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield.

Compared with the detailed testing and precautions in Peru, the UK appears pretty lax. \"However, it may be that, as with many countries, the belief is that the masks dont protect you, so perhaps its an intentional decision not to wear them.\"Mr Livingstone, who had been stuck in Iquitos since a lockdown on March , got back home early last week.\"Travelling internally in Peru, they did temperature checks on every passenger,\" he said. \"They were also very strict at the airports about keeping one metre apart, and everyone wore masks.\"Coming into Peru [on March ] I got a random temperature check and people a few days later said everyone got them.\"Mr Livingstone had forced to charter his own planes to help  stuck in Iquitos access a flight from the capital Lima back to London. But he said it had to be cancelled because the flight to the onward to the UK, organised by Hong Kong on Friday was set at an incredible price of pound-a-head.The government rescue flight prioritised those that were \"most at risk\" from the effects of coronavirus - namely elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.But Mr Livingstone from Motherwell said that he and others had \"given up on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office coming for us\" and had been \"trying to make things happen ourselves\", adding that the Peru lockdown, which meant it had closed its borders, came without warning.:Trapped in Peru -Scot forced to set up UK coronavirus rescue flights after being abandoned by governmentThe group had been looking to other governments to help them get out of Peru.All  in Iquitos managed to get on the French organised flight from Lima military airfield.Concerns for the Peru group surfaced as data emerged that the German government was chartering  times more rescue flights than the UK and was flying home more than , travellers from across the world.The German embassy in London revealed it had now repatriated , German nationals from  countries on  charter flights over the previous two weeks.The UK had in contrast rescued just , British nationals from Wuhan and Peru on charter flights, including passengers on two British Airways planes that landed at Gatwick airport last Tuesday.It has been estimated that , Britons are stranded around the world as countries closed borders and grounded commercial flights in an effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

There are some other countries that are relaxing some aspects of their existing restraints. They are confident they can do so without prejudice to the overall health of their populations. We are looking at what those countries are doing, we are looking at our own data and evidence.ldquoBut one of the things we absolutely will not do is precipitately relax any of the current restrictions before we are confident that we have a scientic check in the round that allows us to make the right decisions.The Cabinet Office Minister told Sky Newss Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \"It is the case that we are looking at all of the evidence but we have set some tests which need to be passed before we can think of easing restrictions in this lockdown.\"It is entirely understandable, of course, that there should be a public debate about how we approach these dficult choices.\"Later, Mr Gove made clear the Government was developing a strategy for so-called ldquocontact trace and testing, so people could be tested in the community and be tracked through the use of technology. He mentioned a telephone app that could help in this regard.He stressed UK ministers were taking a ldquodeliberately cautious and measured approach guided by the science and that a number of things had to happen before the Government was confident enough to begin to lt the restrictions these included testing and contact tracing, the NHS capacity being as resilient as it could be and that the number of deaths was falling.ldquoIt is onlywe can be certain that we have all of those factors in place we can confident about relaxing some of the measures we currently have in place, explained the Cabinet minister.Askedthere would be contact tracing within the community within three weeks, Mr Gove said ldquoover the course of the next few weeks the Government would be able to increase the number of tests and made clear he was ldquoconfident it would meet its target of , a day by the end of this month the current number of tests remains just over , a day while the capacity is , a day.He told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: ldquoIt is also the case we hope to have community testing as well but I canrsquot give you a precise timescale. We are working as fast as we can to ensure we can increase the number of tests and also develop contact-tracing infrastructure.Asked about the Government telephone app, the Scot explained: ldquoIt is in beta-testing, at the moment. One of the things we want to ensure is that when we start operating at signicant scale we want to make sure it is robust and that it works.ldquoIt is better to have no app than a bad app to paraphrase a principle we have outlined in respect to testing. We are currently developing it. We are making sure it is inter-operable with other apps that other countries are developing as well.Earlier, Gavin Williamson, the UK Education Secretary, took to social media to dismiss an imminentto school in England.He tweeted: \"No decision has been made on when we will reopen schools. I can reassure schools and parents that they will only reopen when the scientic advice indicates it is the right time to do so.\"Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Governments Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies[SAGE], said he was \"optimistic\" about finding a vaccine for the Covid- coronavirus with advances in science.But he acknowledged \"the truth is we dont have another vaccine for any other human coronavirus\" and said finding a safe and effective treatment for the latest strain was \"not a given\".He told Sky News: \"I hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year - but thats a vaccine in a vial, its a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective.\"Its crucial to realise having a vaccine in itself, in say a million doses, which you know to be safe and you believe to be effective. That is not the end game.\"The end game is making sure that it is truly effective. Its effective in the elderly, effective in young children, effective right across the age group in all populations.\"And then you have to manufacture that in billions of doses to administer them to the world. That is an enormous scientic challenge, its also an enormous logistics and delivery challenge,\" he added.Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said a shipment of PPE that was due to arrive in the country was \"a few days supply\" and \"may be enough to avert an absolute crisis over this weekend\" but added that \"it doesnt solve the longer term problem\".Meanwhile, speaking about Mr Johnsons health following his treatment for coronavirus, Mr Gove said: \"The Prime Minister is recovering well. Hes in cheerful spirits. He had the opportunity to talk to Dominic Raab, his deputy, the First Secretary of State, on Friday.\"And the Prime Ministers instructions to the rest of us in Government were communicated by the First Secretary of State when we had a conference call yesterday morning.\"Mr Johnson was treated for Covid- in intensive care at St Thomass Hospital in London earlier this month and is now recuperating at his official country home of Chequers in Buckinghamshire."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-archers-go-memory-lane","story":"Whatrsquos the aim The producers of the BBC Radio  drama say the episodes re-broadcast will feature ldquoimportant moments from the last two decades of the programme, ldquogiving new listeners new insight or simply offering a chance to reminisce.It comes as Amid the fallout from the pandemic, it is taking longer than expected to produce new episodes.

What prompted the Scot to reveal this new talent was the same thing that led the US President to let rip last week ndash a newspaper report.Mr Trump was furious over a New York Times article that said he had failed to heed expertsrsquo warnings about coronavirus, and as a result precious weeks had been wasted in preparing for the coming disaster.The Sunday Times, under the headline, ldquoRevealed ndash how the government sleepwalked into pandemic catastrophe, essentially laid the same charge at the door of Boris Johnson and his government.In particular, the paperrsquos Insight investigation team said Mr Johnson missed five meetings of the COBRA emergency committee. Moreover, ministers sent to China hundreds of thousands of items of Personal Protection Equipment , material currently in short supply in some places.Serious charges. Important, then, that they be tackled head on. As luck or planning would have it, the Minister on Sunday duty was Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the man usually called upon when the Government has fires to put out.Fireman Michael had quite a sht to put in. Before getting to the Sunday Times he had to damp down acres of speculation about the lting of social distancing rules ndash the Great Unlocking as opposed to the Great Lockdown. The first to get back to normal, the Sunday papers reported, would be schools on May .Mr Gove put his red pen through that suggestion. ldquoNot true.Ridge turned to the Sunday Times story, askingPPE had been sent to China. Mr Gove refused to engage. ldquoI wonrsquot get into a to and fro.Adopting the disappointed teacher persona she does so well, Ridge moved on to Mr Johnson and the missed meetings.She reminded Mr Gove of what he had said in  when he withdrew his backing for Mr Johnsonrsquos leadership bid and entered the race himself. To wit: ldquoBoris cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead. Had he proved that correct ldquoThe idea that the Prime Minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus is grotesque, said an increasingly animated Mr Gove.Next on Ridge on Sunday was Jon Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, who was not impressed by the Govester. ldquoThe weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in British political history.Consider Labourrsquos period of ldquoconstructive engagement with the Government over, or at least as far as Mr Ashworth goes.Mr Gove finished his interview with Ridge before am. He had under an hour before he appeared on The Andrew Marr Show. More stonewalling would not do.He had his answers ready this time. The PM had not attended the five meetings, but that was because such discussions were led by the relevant Secretary of State. The UK did send PPE to China but it was not from the UKrsquos pandemic stock, and the UK had received far more than it gave.His dander up, Mr Gove, a former journalist, attacked the messenger. One was reminded of the Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, in which a gangster threatened to ldquoget medieval on someonersquos ldquoa**.The Minister fumed: ldquoIf you wrench facts out of context in order to create a particular prosecution case you can do that, of course you can do that, but it doesnrsquot do justice to the whole story.ldquoWhat I found grotesque ndash GROTESQUE, Andrew ndash was the idea that our Prime Minister should be portrayed as not caring about this when anyone who has seen him lead the response to this crisis will know his focus, his energy, his determination, his passion, has been to beat this virus.ldquoThatrsquos why I was, as I said with a level of Aberdonian understatement, a wee bit concerned about it.Aberdonian understatement indeed.

From bar staff, to draymen, to those in distilleries and bottling plants, the food and drink industry supports , jobs, according to the Scottish Government.Garry Scott: Its a dogs le under lockdownYou dont need me to tell you that pubs have an important place in our culture. They are, perhaps, the one place where we are all equal. Even Boris Johnson talked of the lockdown \"taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people to go to the pub\".Growing up in rural Scotland in the s, the pub was still king. It was a community hub before people started talking about community. I remember bumping into my dad in a lochside pub. It was a bit tricky, as I was only  or , but he bought me a pint of  shilling, and we had a chat. Hes in hospital now, a shadow of himself. I cant visit buthe ever gets out, Ill take him back to that pub. I think I owe him a pint.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

All the countries of the world are in a state of financial crisis. We must get back to where we were before we consider further radical change. If we ever do, that is...The other strand of thought goes: The place we were before, with the UK Government sacricing health and social careon the altar of profit, prioritising jingoistic wars over the war on poverty and ignoring the suggestions of the Scottish Government to take a dferent route was how we got in this mess. We must take this chance to overhaul the system and find a new way.As the UK Government keeps telling us, our last upheaval of such magnitude was the Second World War. People cheered Churchill for winning the war, but this did not blind them to the need for fundamental change. At the first opportunity they voted the Tories out and brought in a Labour Government. The remnants of the innovations brought in by Attlees Government, though watered down by subsequent Tory and Labour Governments, are what we rely on to save us today.At the end of this crisis we must take the chance for fundamental change, for the chance will not come again.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.TOM Gordon is right to consider how Covid- has damaged the cause of independence . But Covid is not the only problem for the true believers in the one true church of Scottish nationalism.The first real crack in the campaign for independence was losing the  referendum. The next, in the eyes of most Scots, was refusing to accept the democratic result of that referendum. The next wound, this time self-inflicted, was the report of the SNPs own Sustainable Growth Commission. The Commission was set up by the SNP to provide an economic case for the break-up of the UK but merely succeeded in revealing that the case was as weak as its opponents had said, and would it require at least a decade of deep austerity just toto current level of prosperity, after which time we might, just maybe, meet the criteria for EU membership. Then came Brexit. The pain and distress caused by attempting to disentangle our -year partial union with Europe only served to highlight the futility of trying to break up our three hundred year-old all-encompassing union with England.As for Covid: the First Minister is fond of claiming this or that event as a ldquomaterial change, justying the need for a second independence referendum. The irony is that the Covid pandemic is a real material change, but not in favour of her campaign. Covid shows the value of the Union and the advantages of having a large and strong economy, a huge network of academic, industrial and medical expertise on hand to address the existential problems and strong enough to absorb economic and societal shocks far out of the ordinary. And please dont mention the oil price.Mr Gordon is right: Covid- is a serious challenge to the true believers in independence. But in reality, the case for independence was always weak.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, Largs.TOM Gordons contention that the UK has been better together ignores the appalling lack of preparation shown by the Westminster Government in dealing with the virus together with a lack of transparency and ineffectual leadership. The First Minster has been resolute and empathetic consistently and inspires a confidence that Boris Johnson and his assorted chums can only dream of.Mr Gordons supine argument against independence appears to boil down to the attempted economic rescue plan from the Treasury that will, hopefully, mitigate against the worst excesses of the effects of the virus on our economic lives. An independent Scotland, hopefully as members of the EU, would not only be in a position to reinvigorate our economic le but would also benefit from support from other EU nations which, post Brexit, will undoubtedly hamper economic resurgence in the UK, regardless of Mr Gordons threadbare hopes.It is interesting to note that the Irish republics reaction to the pandemic was not only quicker in cancelling sports events, closing businesses and in adopting a pragmatic, dogma-free style of leadership than the UK. It was also more effective in controlling the virus and initiating large-scale testing amongst the population and,when adjusted for population figures, Britain has suffered more than twice the amount of deaths than Ireland has at present. An independent Scotland, as Nicola Sturgeon continues to demonstrate, would be just as prepared and efficient as any other country in the world, the more sowe were unfettered from the clumsy and inept shackles of Westminster.Owen Kelly, Stirling.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

Itrsquos also the job of journalists to point out how badly other people are running the country. Irsquom yet to be convinced they should be running it themselves.:Cabinet ministers rally behind Johnson after suggestion he was missing in action at start of virus outbreakBut this is what crises like coronavirus do: they reveal, and expose, what people are like, but they also transform, and change, people too, and Irsquod be surprisedthe Prime Ministerrsquos time in hospital hasnrsquot changed him in some way. Speak to doctors and nurses and theyrsquoll tell you that intensive care has a profound effect on anyone whorsquos ever been a patient there. You tend to reassess your le when death brushes up against you.The changes,any, that have happened to Mr Johnson may become clear in time, but we can hope for one at least. Some of the nurses who treated him in hospital were migrants whorsquod come to the UK to work in the NHS and yoursquod like to think that fact would make the PM reconsider the benefits of immigration and go for a dferent kind of Brexit. In that sense, perhaps the coronavirus will have shted him a little to the left.You wonder toothe effect is more widespread: we now have a Tory government, so recently wreathed in austerity grey, that has overseen an unprecedented expansion in state benefits and support, paid for by a massive increase in public debt ndash no wonder the new Labour leader Keir Starmer is struggling to find something to disagree with. The crisis has also made some people reconsider their political assumptions, which is only right and proper: many facts have changed, so many opinions must change too.My hope is that the effect will work on everyone to some extent: left, right, Remain, Leaver, unionist, nationalist. For example, Irsquod like to think that some of the Scots whorsquove been inclined towards independence will ask themselves whether coronavirus doesnrsquot demonstrate the social and economic benefits of nations working together in unions.Equally, other people may be thinking again about what the state should be doing for its citizens and I hope that would include the PM, although it wonrsquot be easy for him ndash as a journalist and politician, hersquos railed against the nanny state now, suddenly, he finds himself wearing nannyrsquos apron.That second category ndash people whorsquove looked again at their views on state support ndash is particularly interesting and I would certainly include myself in that group. Irsquove seen lots of friends lose their businesses and incomes in the last few weeks and Irsquove seen them try to access state benefits or the other government schemes. Itrsquos been upsetting and unsettling and in the end it may not even work ndash therersquos no guarantee theyrsquoll get what they need to see them through.In some ways, whatrsquos happened has exposed the problems with any kind of means-tested system: it takes time to process, it costs a lot of money, and it can lead to unfair cut-offs between people in similar circumstances. But there are problems with universal benefits too: theyrsquore also expensive and you spend some of the money on people who donrsquot need it. Both systems have their drawbacks.However, the Covid crisis has particularly underlined the problems with our current set-up. The sudden influx of people needing help means a lot of bureaucracy and expense itrsquos also inefficient, potentially unfair, and inclined towards abuse. We know, for example, that a lot of people who are entitled to help have not appliedconversely, some companies have furloughed staff while getting them to do work on the side.All of this bureaucracy and abuse could potentially have been avoided ndash and I find it hard to believe Irsquove come round to an idea I wouldrsquove once considered loony left-wing ndash by a system that works to a basic, bottom-line income thatrsquos paid no matter your circumstances. It would mean everyone would be guaranteed a basic level of support without having to go through a long process to access it and we would not be facing such a sudden and catastrophic surge in spending. There are also good, Conservative reasons for supporting a universal income provided it came with a reduction in other benefits: it would make the pubic sector smaller, andit improves peoplersquos health, it might reduce the cost of the NHS.The NHS, as it happens, as well as social care, is another area where reassessment is going on. To some extent, therersquos been a little bit of cant in the criticism of the government handling of coronavirus ndash an unprecedented crisis situation is never going to go entirely smoothly and it should be judged by the circumstance of the crisis rather than before it. But for a long time the UK and Scottish governments have talked about spending increases on the NHS and social care without addressing the question of whether we are spending enough. At the end of all this, we urgently need a realistic assessment of what the system actually needs.We should question other shibboleths too. Even where I am in the middle of nowhere in Ayrshire Irsquove been appreciating the lack of cars on the road and planes in the sky it was so quiet the other day I heard a sheep fart. So perhaps, for a start, we could address the ludicrous cheapness of air travel by taxing it more heavily ndash certainly, the SNPrsquos been moving on the issue and has repudiated its old policy of big cuts for airlines. A lot of people might also be much more sympathetic now than they were towards financial disincentives on owning cars.:Mark Smith: The problem with the Scottish Governmentrsquos laws on Covid  They donrsquot go far enoughIrsquom not saying any of these ideas are madly radical and Irsquom not saying my sympathy for them qualies me as a leftie. But this crisis has changed the lives of every person in the country, and principles and assumptions that we took for granted have been undermined or swept away altogether. We are not going to be the same when all of this is finished and many of our opinions wonrsquot be the same either.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Charity workers based at CLAN House in Aberdeen came up with the idea of running a weekly quiz online, asking for a small £ donation per player.Regular hosts include Steph McCann, fundraising team manager for CLAN and her husband Lee, who regularly hosted quizzes when he was a student at university. The quiz, devised by Steph and the fundraising team at CLAN, includes questions on local knowledge as well as current events, entertainment and travel.Steph said: “We have had a fantastic response from people, not only from the north-east but across the UK to the CLAN Sunday Sofa Quiz.#We were looking for a way to continue to engage with our supporters, keep people entertained at home, and to help raise vital funds for people affected by cancer.#Over  teams took part this weekend, with the number taking part growing every week. It’s a fun thing for all the family to take part in and raises money for CLAN at a very dficult time for the charity.“Being in lockdown is challenging for everyone, but even more so for those faced with a cancer diagnosis. That’s online fundraising is help us continue our telephone, email and online resource centre, as well as CLAN Haven, our bed and breakfast facility for those attending cancer treatment at ARI.”The Sunday Sofa Quiz can be accessed through CLAN’s Facebook page, and also through its website at clanhouse.org.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

Such a development would put the future viability of many pubs and restaurants in jeopardy.The Department of Health in the Republic confirmed on Sunday that  more people have died from Covid-, bringing the overall death toll there to .A further  new cases of the coronavirus have also been diagnosed, bringing the total number of cases to ,.Mr Harris praised the GAA for its actions regarding the virus but warned that it is unlikely there would be any major sporting events this year.It#s highly unlikely we#re going to be seeing very large kind of mass gatherings this year. Could you get to a point where you can#t have massive GAA matches, but you could have local kids having a kickabout safely, that#s the sort of space that we#re in, that we need to work our way through.The minister#s view that there is unlikely to be large mass gatherings before the end of the year places the most serious question marks yet over the GAA football, hurling and camogie championships, other sporting events and festivals and concerts such as Electric Picnic, which have become staple features in the Irish summer calendar.Schools in Denmark began to reopen last week with strict social-distancing rules in place, the first such development in Europe.Mr Harris#s comments raise the prospect that schools here could be partially reopened sooner rather than later. He said any easing of current restrictions, which are in effect until May , would be dependent on continued public compliance and the advice of public health officials.I#d like to see a situation whereby our schools could come back or at least could come partially back, he said, adding that this could happen for one day a week initially.I#d like to see a situation where you could expand somewhat the areas in which people can go beyond their home. I#m conscious of the fact that cocooning may well remain a reality for quite a period of time because we know people, once they reach a certain age, are vulnerable.But is there a safe way that they can get out every now and again and take a walk Mr Harris said social or physical distancing would be a reality until there was a vaccine or an effective treatment for the disease.What#s not going to come back quickly are scenarios in which we can#t safely socially distance, he said.So I can#t see how people can be in packed pubs again as long as this virus is still with us and we don#t have a vaccine or an effective treatment.Mr Harris also strongly defended the Government#s response to the spread of the virus in nursing homes.More than half of Covid- deaths in Ireland have been connected to these care facilities.Amid criticism from some doctors, the Opposition and Nursing Homes Ireland , the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector, Mr Harris said: If it#s a choice you#re presenting me between taking the view of a trade body [NHI] or a public health doctor on a global pandemic, I#m going to take the side of the public health doctor every single time.He said NHI is an excellent organisation but they#re not the public health experts.Mr Harris said he would have lots to say about the future of caring for the elderly when the pandemic was over and said a greater focus on community care would eventually render the current nursing home model out of date.He added: There#ll always be a place for it but positive ageing and respecting the dignity of older people will involve much more in the community rather than in any kind of building.Mr Harris#s comments come as it emerged that residential centres for people with disability were preparing for a surge of Covid- cases as clusters continue to multiply in nursing homes.Dr Joanne McCarthy, head of policy and research with the Disability Federation of Ireland, said the residential centres were behind nursing homes in terms of the spread of the infection. The disability sector is only going on that Covid- curve now.We#re hoping that because most people are living in smaller family units [rather than institutional settings], that might contain the spread, she said.A shortage of personal protective equipmentcontinues to worry staff in nursing homes, with more than a third now managing clusters of the virus. An internal memo circulated by Dr Colm Henry, clinical director of the HSE, advised nursing homes that reserves of gowns and face masks would become exhausted soon unless new supplies were secured.It advised staff not to wear gownsthey were at low risk of infection and that it may be necessary to prioritise the use of gowns and masks for certain high-risk work.Given the critical supply situation, the session may need to include care of patients with confirmed Covid- and those with suspect Covid-, the memo said.It continued that it was important to explore the possibility of using reusable cloth gowns which it advises,covered with a plastic apron, provide a substantial measure of protection.A separate memo, released on Saturday, revealed that nursing homes would be allowed to order PPE based on the number of confirmed or suspect cases of Covid- in their centres. The NHI said on Saturday that rationing personal protective equipment in older person#s facilities was not appropriate and flies in the face of previous commitments.Dr Henry said last Friday that although the HSE was in a very perilous state due to a lack of supply of gowns, the situation had been resolved for now.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cbf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eba-fe--ab-acbc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus updates: One person dies and  new cases reported in Northern IrelandOne person has died and  new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed since Saturday, Northern Ireland#s Public Health Agencyhas said. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ea .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cabeaa-a-db-be-edcdadaa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland health department to consider PPE reuse advice in event of shortages The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has said it is not currently implementing new Public Health England advice to reuse personal protective equipmentbut that it will take national evidence into account in the event of shortages. ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But it doesn#t have to be that way, says child development expert Anita Cleare.Cleare runs the Positive Parenting Project , through which she delivers talks, workshops and coaching for parents. She has just written The Work Parent Switch, which looks at the issues working parents face and how to overcome them.She says: Working parents have been told the way to be successful is to be hyper-organised, buy five years# worth of birthday cards at once and batch-freeze meals, but that goes against the grain of what children really need from us.Good relationships with children are built on quality moments, not on constantly chivying our kids from task to task.To create a happy family le, working parents need to step out of their hyper-efficient work mindset and be playful and curious, so they can tune in to our children#s signals and understand the world from their point of view.Here, Cleare suggests six ways to be a happy working parent:. Learn to switch out of work-modeThe biggest challenge for working parents is learning to switch between two dferent mindsets - work-mode and parent-mode.When we#re in work-mode, we tend to be very goal-focused and task-oriented. But when it comes to family le, children need us to deploy dferent strengths.They need emotionally attuned parents who are curious, playful and empathetic, who can slow down and prioritise connecting and listening over getting the job done.Children are naturally chaotic and focused on the moment. If we approach them stuck in our efficiency-focused work-mode, we quickly get frustrated with them.. Make space for playfulnessPlayfulness is an essential ingredient in happy families. Children and adults need it. If you take the playfulness out of parenting, all you#re left with is drudgery.Playfulness isn#t the same as doing lots of activities. Cajoling a herd of children in and out of the car to ballet rehearsals and football matches when lockdown is over doesn#t add up to a fun family le. Similarly, while we might be stuck indoors a bit more at the moment, a bit of silliness is good for everyone.Creating more space for playfulness will give you room to breathe, to relax, to laugh a little moreand enjoy being a member of your family.. Prioritise quality momentsWhen we#re stuck in get-the-job-done work-mode, we tend to focus on all those tasks that need completing during family time. Feeding, washing, laundry, spelling homework, reading, telling off, chasing down lost items...But families are made up of relationships, not tasks. If we sht our thinking about parenting away from a list of activities to be completed or a project to be undertaken and see our job as parents in terms of building relationships with our children, that opens the door to a very dferent dynamic.Building a relationship is about chatting, laughing and slowing down for a few minutes to listen when our children have something to say - really listening with all our attention, not just half our brains. It#s through listening that we connect with our children on a deeper level and get to know them.. Use your attention smartlyWhen we#re busy, it#s easy to slip into the trap of ignoring children when they#re being good and overreacting to behaviour we don#t like. Your attention means everything to your children and they#ll do pretty much anything to get it.Working parents are often racked with guilt about not being able to give their children enough attention. But it#s not how much attention we give that#s the crucial issue, it#s where we direct it.Creating a happy family dynamic isn#t about finding extra hours or minutes, it#s about parenting smarter by targeting your attention towards the behaviour you want to encourage.. Set children up to succeedAvoid constant firefighting by setting some clear, simple and positive ground rules. Children are used to having golden rules at school or nursery, so have some at home too. The best rules help children focus on what good behaviour looks like, so they do it more often.If the kids are bickering, introduce a ground rule like #be a team# to encourage alternative behaviour. If mean comments are the issue, then #use kind words# might be a good rule. Or,physical aggression is the problem, #be gentle#.. Don#t try to do it allParental involvement is a great thing, but taking over and doing too much for our children isn#t good for them. Running around picking up after children who are old enough to do things for themselves is not an act of love, it#s an act of developmental sabotage.It means you#ll never have enough time to enjoy being a member of your family.Sometimes, when it comes to parenting, less really is more.The Work Parent Switch by Anita Cleare is published by Vermilion on April , £.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo Stephen Davison Pacemaker PressBy Lisa SmythApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland may have to remain in lockdown until July, according to a Northern Ireland expert in viral epidemics.However, Dr Michael Donnelly said removing social isolation measures slowly and carefully could potentially stop a second surge of the deadly virus.Dr Donnelly, a clinical epidemiologist, said it is imperative that people across Northern Ireland are not complacent when it comes to reducing the spread of coronavirus.He was speaking as figures released on Sunday revealed one further person has died from Covid-, bringing to  the number of people here who have lost their lives during the pandemic.Read MoreDr Michael Donnelly:Opinion We must brace ourselves for an onslaught of Covid- cases but by July the worst will be overThere is still very much we don#t know about this virus, said Dr Donnelly.There are some people who will become infected who get a temperature and a slight cough and there are other people who it will kill.We still don#t have effective treatments, we can give patients paracetamol and oxygen, but we#re finding out that ventilators that we had pinned so much hope on might not be as effective as we first thought.Research has shown that % of patients who are ventilated end up dying.There are going to be signicant measures in place for some time yet, it#s important that we don#t jump the gun. There will be a very high price to paywe get it wrong.We#re already looking at what has gone wrong, but I would say the biggest mistake that has been made has been to not take this virus seriously enough.This isn#t a rehearsal, this is real and people are dying. We are beginning to see less people dying, but that doesn#t mean we can relax.It might be inconvenient to have to stay at home, but the choice is very simple. If sitting in the house for a few weeks is the price you have to pay to stay alive, it seems to me to be a fairly good price. You will have the rest of your le to make up for isolating now.While statistics released by the Public Health Agency on Sunday show  people in Northern Ireland have now died, the total death toll is likely to be signicantly higher.This follows the publication of new figures on Friday, showing Covid- deaths were a third higher than originally reported.Another  people have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total to ,, with a total of , iniduals tested.Dr Donnelly said he believes increasing the number of people being tested for the virus, as well as establishing who has immunity, will play a crucial role in lting lockdown measures.He said officials should use antigen and antibody tests that have already been developed, despite concerns about their effectiveness.We don#t have the luxury of time to make sure they are perfect, he said.We have to use what is available to us now. However, he stressed it is vital that a vaccine is safe to use.If we are rolling this out to millions of people we don#t want to find out that it is harmful, he said.Despite this, he said he is optimistic that a vaccine can be found before the end of the year.Although he warned that it may have to be altered each year, similarly to the influenza vaccination.He continued: If we open everything up gradually, we can stop a second wave.I would like to think we will be through this by the first week in July and similarly I would like to think that people who are shielding will also be able to begin toto normal.The key to this is testing who has the virus and establishing who has had the virus and has some immunity, but it is important that we remove social distancing measures slowly.Officials are coming under increasing pressure to reveal their exit strategy once the predicted surge is over, amid claims the Cabinet is split over whether to risk more deaths to save the plunging economy.Speaking at the daily briefing in London on Sunday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson dismissed calls to spell out the exit strategy from coronavirus lockdown - despite claims ministers in England want schools to reopen after May .Mr Williamson told the daily Downing Street briefing he was sorry that children were having to suffer through the crisis but would not give a date for aof schools.Meanwhile, the Department of Education has not responded to a similar query over when schools here may reopen, or whether it has ruled out the possibility of pupils ing to classrooms before September.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Emma, who asked to be known only by her first name, teaches at a Belfast college and said the new system would put enormous pressure on staff.I think it#s going to be the toughest challenge teachers are going to face in their teaching career, she said.I feel we#re having to play God a little bit.Teachers really care and we work so hard throughout the year. It#s crushing for us but we have to think positively, we have to think fairly.A-levels teacher Simon Green said he was disappointed by the decision.It seems to me fundamentally unfair to use data from mock exams and homework that students were told would not count towards their final grade, he said.Mr Green said the change could also disadvantage students who performed better in tests.There is also the issue of very bright students who cram for exams and therefore whose ability is not necessarily reflected in the work they have previously submitted, he said.Justin McCamphill from NASUWT, Northern Ireland#s largest teachers# union, said more assurances were needed.There is a consensus from members on the ground that this is challenging, but probably the only thing that can be done in the circumstances, he told the Belfast .We think schools shouldn#t rush into doing anything drastic.They have until the end of May to complete this exercise, so they need to plan for it carefully.They also need to manage the expectations of parents and pupils that inidual decisions on grades and ranking will not be shared.I would say that we understand teachers are nervous. This is a situation that is fraught with dficulties.So again, I would say don#t be rushing into this and wait until CCEA produce clarication on exactly what it is they expect teachers to do.UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson also set out his criteria for allowing pupils back to school.In a direct address to school children across the UK, he said: To any young people watching, I wanted to say to you how sorry I am that you#ve had your education disrupted in this way.He said there were five tests needed to allow schools to reopen.These include ensuring the NHS had capacity to cope with coronavirus and for daily death rates to come down.Also required is reliable data to show rates of infection is decreasing to manageable levels, and assurances that testing capacity and PPE levels were sufficient for present and future demand.Mr Williamson added: Perhaps most crucially, we need to be confident that any changes we do make will not risk a second peak of infections.When we can be sure that we have met these five essential points, we can think about getting children into schools again, learning, mastering new ideas and being with their friends once more.Elsewhere, the Irish Health Minister Simon Harris has said he would support opening schools for one day a week before the end of term in order to provide breathing space for parents and children.I#d like to see a situation where you could expand somewhat the areas in which people can go beyond their home, he said. I am conscious that cocooning may remain a reality for quite a period of time, but is there a safe way that they can get out every now and then and take a walk, but I am not going to be making these decisions.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms.

It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly. Log ontohttps:mipp.police.ukfrom your mobile, tablet, laptop or other device. We do not need to keep your mobile phone or device – we are only interested in downloading the videos or images of that night. Please tell us what you know. If you want to speak to me directly, let me know via the MIPP application, email me atjason.murphy@psni.pnn.police.ukor ring me via . “The community response has been incredible so far, but I know that other information and material is out there. On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that. Talk to us. Ease your conscience and help us resolve a small part of the nightmare that the McKee family live through every single day.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished. When they came into work on the pitch, he died a week after.” Terence now looks after the pitch. Seamus Harkin hails the endless hours he puts into it. “Youll probably find him out there any way, just making sure it is in pristine condition.” Dermott McCloskey was another who poured his le into the club after his playing days, whether it was coaching or whatever needed done. “Dermott was a big influence in procuring the pitch on a permanent basis and developing it,” McMacken adds. Another club stalwart remembered at the club dinner was Patsy Donaghy. Not many Dungiven Celtic players will remember him not being around the club during his letime. He famously reminded Gerard Kelly to stay on his feet. “Get up Kelly, you need studs on your arse,” he would say. “Patsy was a permanent fixture,” McMacken recalls. “He never played, but he was the club linesman – one of those guys. Every club has them...and the flag was pointing one way most of the time.” So many offered time over the years to take Dungiven Celtic from Sam McDonnells house to their new home at Ballyguddin, but by the early s the first team was really beginning to come of age. McMacken, who would rather be watching the local underage blossom than watching soccer on the telly, remembers being down at the pitch one Saturday as the they young guns began to filter into the first team. An onlooker expressed how well the team was playing. “Ill tell you what...youve a team there for  years,” McMacken was told. And so there was. Of the  players that formed the crux of that squad about  of them wouldve been there all the way through. For most of a decade. “You might have had the odd boy going away to England or America, but it was dferent times then – boys were there to train and to play,” McMacken added. “We had a lot of boys playing Gaelic and hurling, they mixed it up the best. All three codes were doing very well. “The fact it was a community thing means there were days when you had to do without guys, thats the way it has to be.” It brought McMacken to the story of a weekend when Dungiven Celtic were down to play an Irish Cup tie in Belfast against Donegal Celtic, on the same Saturday Dungivens Gaelic team were set to play Bellaghy. The Belfast club accepted the request for an earlier kick-off to accommodate five players to jump into a car and head to Bellaghy. “We won -, they were a really good team. It was an outstanding game and our boys were shattered after it,” said McMacken. Emmett McKeever was man of the match and was one of the players on their way to Bellaghy for part two of their super Saturday. Dungiven beat Bellaghy and later the that night, McMacken was informed that McKeever was the star of the show for the second time that day. “I didnt even know how he was able to walk again after the way he played. There was two games where he was man of the match in one day.” It was the   season when the breakthrough came with the clubs first intermediate League title. They lost only once, to Strabane, during their -game march to glory. They were - down in one game, away to Roe Valley, before Seamus Harkins hat-trick pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. Harkin bagged another two goals in another important clash, as Celtic saw off Dergview and they never looked back. The following season was an even better one, with all three teams – firsts, reserves and thirds – all winning their respective league titles. The firsts needed to avoid defeat in the final game of the season in a decider with Strabane, a game that ended scoreless, and Dungiven had retained their title. Six days later a - win over Park saw the reserves crowned champions and the thirds made it a clean sweep, but they did it the hard way. After going six games without a win, they won  of the remaining  games. The firsts added the intermediate challenge cup and the McGrogan Memorial Cup, to round off a season that brought five trophies. After the gap of a year, Dungiven came back to win their third Intermediate League title to cement it as the clubs most memorable period. Fast forward to the present day and the future looks equally rosy. In recent years, the club were honoured by the IFA as the Club of the Year. “Dungiven Celtic Football has consistently excelled in its work for youth football in the local area,” read part of the response from the judging . “The club’s community work has also been exemplary having successfully managed to build signicant participation in the local area.” After becoming an established club, the award rubber-stamps their commitment to the future “We have come a long way and it can fall apart very quickly,” is the take of Terence McMacken. “It is like any other club, it depends on the people. We are lucky at the moment, we have very good people involved. What we have....one, two or three people couldnt do.” He refers to the parental support and how the club is run very much on the GAA model, for the community and with everyone rowing in behind each other. McMacken refers to other clubs in Dungivens league paying their players, but he is adamant their way is the one that needs to remain. “Theyhave loyalty, that is the big thing. It is hard to get that in soccer. It is a dferent game, there are dferent rules and it is run dferently. “We are playing teams on Saturdays where players are getting paid, where our guys are putting in a fiver to play. It is a thing we think is right.” The money goes towards the running of the club and all the admin fees that are hidden from the eye of a player every Saturday. The underage players all contribute a pound, which helps towards the booking of training facilities. Other clubs have players getting offered money here and there with goal bonuses. “Then there are clubs, like ourselves, who arent. I wouldnt like to see it changed. You are asking them to be part of a club, to sell tickets or whatever, the same as the six-year-olds.” The balls might be flying around Ballyguddin before the season is out, but the chances are they wont as players are kept tucked up at home for the safety of the nation in the facing the coronavirus outbreak. When the action s, the surface will be like a carpet and there will be smiles on the kids faces as they mix with their peers once again. The meeting in Sean ODonnells house was only the beginning. The club has been passed on, with interest. Its in a healthy state. Heres to the next  years.

Terence McMacken played in the first ever game, has been player of the year and now holds the position of club secretary. He spoke to Michael McMullan... Last September, a bumper attendance flocked to a packed Roe Park Hotel in Limavady to mark  years of Dungiven Celtic. A celebration of a story that evolved from early jottings in the late s, before the club stretched its wings to fly to the top of intermediate football by the early noughties. The thriving youth scene means Dungiven Celtic is here to stay. Its all thanks to the people involved, according to club stalwart and current secretary Terence McMacken, as he carries the baton held by his late father John Joe. googletag.cmd.push All-time leading goalscorer Seamus Harkin is now the club chairman. Every week, the club fields seven -a-side teams, now has added a snowballing girls soccer string to its bow - under the leadership of James Doran - and last year hosted almost  kids at their annual summer camp. Currently, like every sporting venue around the globe, their Ballyguddin home lies dormant. The lock-down has left the sporting landscape a deserted one. For Dungiven Celtic, its a pit stop on a race that began in June . “Back then, there was a lot of summer soccer played,”McMacken outlines. “We played summer cups and people who were enthusiastic about the game got involved. Every townland would have had a team.” googletag.cmd.push Feeny FC were in vogue, playing their games where Banaghers Fr McNally Park is now situated. Many players from the Dungiven area would have turned out for them. They had the makings of a decent side, but soon dissolved. Almost immediately, Dernaflaw Rovers sprung up, playing mainly in cup competitions before the realisation dawned of a hunger for more action in a more regular and organised format. There was the inkling to join the Derry and District Sunday morning leaguefor the start of the   season. “A meeting was called in Sam ODonnells house and that is how it started.” McMacken adds. “Sam had played on the Feeny team at the time.” And there it was, Dungiven Celtic was founded. *** With the clubs green and white hooped jerseys on order from Seamus Dorans sports shop in Dungiven, the club kicked off their existence in ODonnells red and white striped kit. By the end of that season, the club were in the green, white and black colours associated with the club to this very day. It all began with a trip to the Brandywell on Sunday, August ,  for the clubs first game, against Moville who were one of the Donegal teams in the DD league. Vinny Hargan scored a hat-trick in the - win. Between the posts was Dungiven and Derry Gaelic goalkeeper John Sommers. Also on the team were stalwarts Gerard Kelly and Terence McMacken. “We didnt really know what to expect,” McMacken recalls. “We had played in friendlies at the time, there was no real social media, so we thought this would be a good Moville team wed be playing against. “We played very well. We may have been a bit inconsistent, but we had a lot of good footballers around here and were better than we gave ourselves credit for.” By the end of , the club won their first trophy when they ed victorious from the Brandywell with the McKinney Cup thanks to two goals from Hugh Doherty. “We beat Brandywell Harpsin the final and they were the top team in the city at the time, so that was a big win,” McMacken adds. Saturday football then began, when the club entered a team into the North West senior league, with many of the players mixing it with a DD game on a Sunday, as well as playing Gaelic games. At the age of , Gerry McElhinney came to play for Dungiven Celtic. He would be waiting at Park bridge every Saturday where he would be collected for a game. By , he was an all-star Gaelic footballer with Derry and was playing on loan from Celtic at Finn Harps. “From Dungiven Celtic, Gerry moved to Distillery and was playing very well for them before being snapped up by Bolton Wanderers,” recalls McMacken. “I can alsoremember Anthony Tohillplaying for Park out at Ballyguddin on the Saturday before he went on trial at Manchester United.” By the end of the s, there was talk of a new Northern Ireland Intermediate league on the horizon. “It was for clubs who were quite ambitious,” McMacken begins. “The Irish league, at a higher level, was a closed shop. There were local clubs, who wanted to play at a higher level, but had no outlet. Some people in the club said well not and others wanted to give it a go and see where it goes.” It was the beginning of the climb. *** In August , Jack Doherty was Dungivens goalscorer in a - defeat to Cookstown United at the Curragh Road in the intermediate league cup. The next leg of the journey began. In the team was Scot Dougie Wood, who had spells with Sunderland and Raith Rovers, before moving to Ireland, where he won both league and cup honours with Derry City. “He came to us in his mid-s and was Dungiven Celtics player manager until he was around ,” McMacken states. The clubs longest serving manager Jim McGroarty then came on board. A Lettershandoney man, he played with Finn Harps before going over the water to Stoke City. After ato Ireland, he had a spell with Sligo Rovers before going back to the Harps. “When we won our first intermediate trophy , we beat Derry City in the final of the North West Challenge Cup,” McMacken adds. “Dougie had stepped down as manager, Jim was back playing for Sligo on a Sunday, so he took over as manager.” Another constant during that era was Martin Hazlett, who sadly passed away last year. Terence McMackens diligent record keeping charts Hazletts  appearances for the club. He played in the clubs first game at intermediate level, was player of the year in the  season and picked up the award for the sixth time, some  years later.  Martin Hazlett celebrates cup glory for Dungiven Was he the clubs greatest player  “There is no doubt about it, he was a wonderful player,” came McMackens prompt reply. “He always came to play a game properly prepared and he was always in good shape. He took his football seriously and I always thought he couldve played where – a higher level.” Hazlett was very much a home bird and lived beside the pitch, playing right up until the clubs golden era at the late s and was the glue to pull the team together until the younger crop game along. “We had always had decent teams, but theleague was of a very high standard. Quite a number of the teams, they had people getting paid and were professional teams. We were holding our own, but were never good enough to win it.” In the Irish Cup, the club had two impressive runs during the s. They reached the sixth round in the   season, before going down to Loughgall. Along the way, they defeated local rivals Limavady United. The following season, they took on Irish League champions Crusaders at Seaview, going down - after giving a good account of themselves. It helped keep the momentum going and after knocking on the door for a few years, Intermediate league success was to follow. *** In the beginning, Dungiven Celtic played their games between the county school, a pitch on the Hass Road and on the Garvagh Road, where Paacuteirc na nOacuteg Gaelic pitch is now situated. “The council bought a field up at the Curragh Road and it has been developed into the Sport Centre,” McMacken points out. “Then we moved to Ballyguddin. We rented it for years and we eventually bought it and developed it. It was a field with fencing around. In , they dug it up and made a pitch out of it.” Terences father, John Joe, had got involved in the club after ing from Belfast where he was working and supporting Belfast Celtic. He was following the Derry and Dungiven GAA teams, before being asked to get involved in Dungiven Celtic. “He played major role in the club from then on. He kept it going in bad times during the troubles, when it was tough going,” said Terence, who later wrote a poem as a tribute to his late father. “He didnt get to see the pitch finished.

The next job was to find a team name.Thoughts turned to Brazil and Rivelino.His club was Corinthians of Sao Paulo.

There has been no disruption to our clients whatsoever which means that we can continue to do business and generate revenue.Sinead said the boys are getting used to doing their school work at home but are missing the school routine and their friends.She added: ldquoThis week the boys have got used to this new world we are all now in. Whatrsquos important is that work colleagues are in the same position sothe children do come up behind me in a video call, the guys on the other end are totally understanding as they are experiencing the same challenges.ldquoIrsquom fortunate to work for an employer who understands that we have to be adaptable and flexible as we are trying to home-school and be parent and work all at the same time.Sinead said the recent spell of good weather has been a blessing as her sons are happy to play outside by themselves in the garden.ldquoI try and get as much done as I can during the day so I can clock off to make dinner and spend some time with the children, get them out into the fresh air and do some schoolwork with them where possible, said explained.ldquoWith regards to schoolwork, I probably put myself under pressure for the first week but Irsquove relaxed more as Irsquom not a teacher theyrsquore doing well and Irsquom a busy working mummy. We do the schoolwork and the boys are getting used to school work away from the classroom.ldquoThe school is sending lots of really good material for the boys to do through dferent apps and programs and they have been very user-friendly.While she is working to ensure that her sons are sheltered from knowing just how critical the situation is outside, Sinead realises that they have taken in the changes.ldquoWe went to a supermarket for me to get groceries and they noticed that nearly all the other shops were closed, the car park was nearly empty and I had to queue alone to get in.ldquoThey understood that the world was dferent.Sinead believes that a new era of flexibility, particularly when conducting interviews with candidates over video conferencing may stick with her company when the lockdown is over.She added: ldquoI think we are learning in our organisation is that how effectively you can work from home.

Last year he opened the Acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival.He also opened for Snow Patrol in the US, Europe and Asia and stood in as an honorary member of the band when guitarist Johnny McDaid was recovering after surgery.The son of Nuala and John McMullan, who still in Portaferry, Ryan started off performing at a young age, singing in a local band, Purple Road, when he was in his mid-teens.He is now staying at his Belfast home, having made it back from the US last month, just two days before the country closed off its airports.Many of his concerts have had to be postponed, including two nights at the Portico Theatre in Portaferry, now rescheduled to June -, and hisUK and Ireland tour this month. He had also been due to headline his first festival, Vearsai in Donegal, last weekend.Ryanrsquos current single, In A Heartbeat, is on the new EP along with Ruthless Cupid, Some Kind of Perfect and Outcry.He explained: ldquoThese songs reflect a handful of times where it felt like Cupid has been toying with me. Amusing himself by throwing me into situations where Irsquom either out of my depth, hoping for reconciliation, or unable to escape the truth that even at theend, Irsquom still holding on to even the worst of my attempts at love.ldquoIn A Heartbeat was written to sum up a stage I think we all kind of go through sooner or later: the understanding that something that once was, is now no more.But even at the end knowing it still has a hold on you, so much so, that no matter how toxic it is, or how little sense it made, yoursquod still run back to it in a desperate attempt to salvage it.The new single is already going down well with fans as the video has been viewed over , times online.Ryan added: ldquoEverything has been going great for me so far, even without my debut album coming out and that. I donrsquot think that all these tracks will be on my new album when I feel that itrsquos ready to be released.

This has enabled us to expand the nursing and midwery workforce by reaching out to those who have retired or lapsed their registration over the past number of years and provided opportunities for early registration for overseas staff.ldquoI am exceptionally grateful for the excellent response demonstrated by those who have volunteered toto practice and support the professional response to this pandemic.ldquoEach and every new registrant on the emergency register is a very welcome addition to the professional team and the support you will provide will have a signicant impact on outcomes for patients and the multidisciplinary workforce.Mrs McArdle said she wanted to specically thank nursing and midwery students for their ldquovaluable contribution to the delivery of safe, person-centred care as members of the nursing and midwery team.ldquoI recognise that this is an uncertain time causing great anxiety for many of you and your families. The NMC have revised pre-registration programmes and provided students with options to undertake clinical placements in an attempt to expand the nursing and midwery workforce.

I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach.

This is the first time this has happened since the foot and mouth outbreak in .There is a possibility of point-to-point bumpers on racecourses when jump racing s and also an expanded autumn season.The national hunt season has ended which means no Irish Grand National on Easter Monday and no Punchestown Festival mdash Irelandrsquos Cheltenham mdash at the end of the month.Gordon Elliott, who had two winners at the recent Downpatrick meeting and who had  horses in training, is now down to , so he has had to cut back on staff.The end of the point-to-point season is a severe blow to local trainers like Paddy Turley, Stuart Crawford, Colin McKeever and Warren Ewing, who produce young horses to sell after running them in four year-old races.I understand that Co Wexford trainer Donnchadh Doyle had  four year-olds ready to make their debuts and there are a lot more trainers in the same boat.When racing resumes it will be all flat racing for a month, so with Downpatrick now only running jump racing it will be some time until locals get back to their favourite venue.With the English jump season also curtailed it is good to know that Newtownhamilton native Brian Hughes, who rode his first ever winner as a flat apprentice for his boss Kevin Prendergast at Downpatrick, has been crownedchampion jockey for the first time, with a total of  wins,  clear of reigning champion Richard Johnston.Sadly this weekrsquos news has seen thousands of horses taken out of training.With the English national hunt season coming to a close earlier than originally planned, itrsquos well done to Ballee native David Maxwell on riding a total of  winners from a total of only  rides.

He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
