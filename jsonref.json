(Getty Images)Arsene Wenger has backed Mesut Ozil to be a ‘huge influence’ at Arsenal after his departure and has urged the midfielder his ‘master his own attitude’.The Germany international was heavily criticised in the wake of Arsenal’s defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League last week, with former Gunners defender Martin Keown claiming that the midfielder ‘was not fit to wear the shirt’.Keown also predicted that the 29-year-old would miss the remainder of the season by feigning an injury.Ozil was a surprise omission from Arsenal’s squad for Wenger’s final home against Burnley on Sunday and has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a back injury.The news of Ozil’s latest injury was met with even more criticism by fans, while reports have claimed that several Arsenal players are unhappy with the midfielder’s attitude.And when asked if the player is aware of the negative reaction towards his own absence, Wenger replied: ‘He’s aware because he’s on social networks, like many people, so he’s aware of that.‘But you cannot always master what people say, you can just master your own attitude.’After months of speculation, Ozil signed a new contract with Arsenal at the end of January and is by far the club’s highest-paid player on £350,000 a week.Wenger insists Ozil’s £350,000-a-week deal is a ‘good investment’. (Colorsport)But Wenger believes keeping the midfielder at the club will be key for the future.‘I think it’s a good investment, the player is top quality, been through a difficult patch at the moment because hes always in and out.‘But once he’s back consistently he will have a huge influence.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_10907996-e1525758287797.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"blake lively wins life attends met gala christian louboutin date","story":"Blakes gown took 600 hours to create (Picture: Taylor HillGetty Images)Blake Lively always serves serious looks at the Met Gala, but 2018 may have produced her best to date.The 30-year-old pretty much won at life as she closed out the red carpet in an opulent Versace gown, while accompanied by Christian Louboutin as her date.She’s living every girl’s dream, and we can’t deal with our jealousy.The Gossip Girl actress left her husband Ryan Reynolds at home for the evening to attend the fundraiser at the politan Museum of Art in New York City with the iconic shoe designer.Now thats what we call a look (Picture: Getty)Blake is the new face of Louboutin’s collection, and the pair made a ridiculously stylish couple at the gala.While Louboutin, 54, looked dashing in a black suit and bow tie and a gold and burgundy brocade overcoat, Blake was sporting the same colour scheme, albeit on a much grander scale.The mum-of-two’s wine satin gown was embellished with intricate gold designs and a highly decorated bodice, with the dress reportedly taking 600 hours to make.The Versace creation was finished off with an extravagant train, while Blake wore a gold spiked crown to adhere to the evening’s theme – Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.Blake had to get changed on a bus due to the size of her gown (Picture: John SheeneACE PicturesREXShutterstock)Well played, Miss Lively, well played.Blake’s dress was so massive that she had to take a party bus to the ball, which sounds a lot better than taking the tube.The actress was earlier seen leaving her hotel on the arm of Louboutin, who was fully dressed for the gala.We reckon everybody bar Blake and Rihanna – who dressed as a high fashion Pope – should just stay home next year.

You might ask for a pay rise. Or, of course, you might just gnash your teeth, wishing you’d listened to your parents and gone into law.Whatever the result, it’s better to know.New data from the Centre for Cities has found that the current average national weekly wage is £539 before tax.But if you’re looking to earn more than that, then you may want to head down south, where you can earn a much bigger packet (and pay way more for rent…).Unsurprisingly, salaries in London are the highest the UK at a weekly £727 – which isn’t that much, considering that the average weekly rent in the capital is £665.87. Wages vary dramatically from borough to borough, with workers in the City bringing Tower Hamlets’ average salary up to £952 per week, compared to Sutton’s £518.Outside of London, the next six highest salaries are all in the southeast of England, including Reading, Crawley, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Slough and Oxford (recently named the best place in the UK to buy a first home).\t\tOn the other hand, the lowest weekly wages in the UK can be found in Southend – just a short train journey from Liverpool Street.

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Fancy having a look inside a bunch of people’s homes?But there’s a reason we’re taking you inside people’s rented houses in London, beyond wanting to see people’s cupboard organisation.The current renting situation is a nightmare. It’s tricky to know what’s a reasonable amount to pay each month, the majority of viewings you go on are dismal rooms with shoddy showers, and it’s hard to get a proper sense of what other people are getting for what they pay.So for What I Rent, we’re showing you around a different person’s rented property each week, to gradually bring us closer to a clearer picture of renting.This week we’re talking to Christie and Dom, who live in Lewisham.The couple pays £1,100 each month. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)First off: How much are you paying and what are you getting in return?We pay £1,100 between us and the flat came fully furnished – apart from the matching red kitchen stuff – we have my lovely nan to thank for those!When we were looking for places to move in we set our upper limit to £1,200 so when we found this for cheaper we were super happy.Dom used to live in a rank flatshare in Vauxhall where you came out of the shower feeling dirtier than when you went in, and he used to pay £600 for the room only. So moving here actually meant him saving money on his rent.Our place is one bedroom, one bathroom, and a big livingdiningkitchen area. We also have a little room for the washing machine and storage too.There’s a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living room and kitchen area. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)One of the only things we decided on when we were looking to move out was that we want one bedroom and definitely wouldn’t go for a studio.The thought of eating, sleeping, chilling, and doing whatever else in the same room makes me feel weird.And what about bills?I feel like we’ve never fully sat down and worked it out. I’d say probably around £100 a month?Luckily our flat is really warm so we rarely have to put the heating on.Whereabouts is the flat?Our flat is in Lewisham, down the insanely busy high street. Luckily our window looks out the back so it’s relatively quiet.It’s really handy being on the high street though because we’ve got loads of hangover-friendly food options in walking distance as well as the shopping centre and the station just a five minute walk away.Plus we live on top of a gym which I’ve just managed to rope Dom into joining under the guise of ‘when are we ever going to live on top of a 24-hour gym again?’It’s a really great location all round to be honest.The flat’s in Lewisham, which is pretty well connected. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)When we tell people we live in Lewisham everyone thinks it’s really far out but it’s actually in Zone 2.It takes 10 minutes to get to London Bridge by train and 20 minutes to Cannon Street, which was one of the first things we made sure of before we viewed the flat. Plus DLR links to Canary Wharf, Bank and Stratford.How did you find your flat?We found it on RightMove. We dedicated one Sunday afternoon at my parents to just hunting for potential flats with the view of arranging viewings for the following week. We viewed this one on the Tuesday and it was held off the market for us that evening.It was the first one we viewed but we knew we really liked it. We also knew that it was cheap for what it was and that there had been viewings before us too, so over a romantic dinner in what would be our new local spoons we decided to go for it.How long have you been there?We’ve lived here for just under a year, but have agreed that we’re going to sign the contract for another year.We have no real reason to move out. It’s a great location, it’s modern with huge windows, has great transport links.Plus we’d miss Tony the concierge if we left, he’s so friendly and always brings our parcels up to our front door for us.Christie admits the room could be a touch bigger, though. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)So you’re happy where you are, right?We’re really happy here – as I said before we have no real reason to move out.The building itself is a converted department store so has a lot of history and character behind it, despite the inside of the flat looking like every other modern flat in London.A lot of people think Lewisham is a e or a bit rough but I loved it as soon as we moved here.Lewisham itself is going under huge regeneration with new restaurants and bars popping up. Despite the regeneration there’s still a hugely multicultural feel – especially down Lewisham high street where there’s still the old school market.I reckon you can buy literally anything there – and it brings such a busy atmosphere especially on Saturday mornings.Plus there’s the Street Feast Model Market just at the other end of the high street which has some amazing food vendors and music.There are some really cool pubs too like the Fox and Firkin and Ladywell Tavern which both have really cool beer gardens and are both within walking distance.Plus if ever you get bored or want to explore somewhere near there’s New Cross, Deptford, Blackheath, Greenwich, and Peckham just down the road which are full of cool pubs, bars, and restaurants. Not to mention the amazing green spaces of Blackheath and Greenwich just 10 minutes from the hustle and bustle of Lewisham high street. It really is the best of both worlds.But having a bathtub is a nice bonus – plus a 24-hour gym in the building. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you feel like you have enough space?While the flat is small I think it’s definitely enough space for us.In terms of storage space it’s a little tight but I think that’s just because we have a lot of stuff.We’ve had to resort to slinging things on top of the wardrobe or down the side of the drawers in the bedroom. You don’t even want to look under the bed… there are boxes and suitcases of shoes and clothes under there too.You two are a couple, so you don’t have to put up with any housemate awkwardness. Was moving in together a big decision?We met at uni and so spent a lot of time together there. After uni we were both in London although I was living at my parents (Uxbridge, Zone 6) and working near Heathrow airport so we only saw each other at weekends.My job was only maternity cover though and I wanted to be working in London so we kind of both agreed that when I got a new job we would look for somewhere to live.It was never really up for discussion we both just kind of knew it was the next step in our relationship.We’d already been together almost three years by the time we moved in so wasn’t particularly a risky move.And as a couple, they don’t have to worry about any housemate weirdness. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)This all sounds dreamy. Is there anything not so great about where you’re living?I wouldn’t say major issues but there’s some building work going on at the moment as they’re adding two extra floors to the building. So recently we’ve been greeted with loud drilling some mornings.Apart from that we’ve never had any issues with the flat itself, our landlord, or our agent which I feel is a rarity when you rent in London.The bedroom is verging on a little too small for us, and has a weird internal window that makes the room too dingy when you want it to be light and too light when you want it to be dark.Have you considered buying a place?We’ve definitely spoke about it but I think more in the sense of a distant possibility rather than something that’s going to happen soon. With such huge deposits required and such a high cost of living in London it’s just not achievable for us to start saving for a house deposit at the moment.We’re both still relatively young (23 and 24) so we’re happy renting for now.Plus, I think there’s definitely less importance around being a homeowner these days, especially in London.When we do eventually buy a house I think it would definitely be outside of London. Not only for the price but I’m really missing having a garden to sunbathe in!Now, let’s have a proper look around Christie and Dom’s flat…(Picture: Alexander Crawley)MORE: What I Rent: Miranda and George, £1,283 for a flat in HighgateMORE: What I Rent: Mel, £615 a month for a room in Newington Green"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/13/4BB4F23700000578-5691219-image-a-71_1525436953731.jpg","title":"Who Candace Owens Kanyes favorite free thinker","story":"    After being praised on Twitter, Candace Owens and her boss Charlie Kirk secured a meeting with Kanye West and the trio met in CaliforniaReturning to the social media platform after a breakdown in 2016, Kanye tweeted: ‘I love the way Candace Owens thinks,’ and followed up this tweet with one reading ‘Only free thinkers.’Frank Ocean parodied this tweet by posting: ‘I love the way Michelle Wolf thinks.’ But who is Candace Owens?Who is Candace Owens?Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Candace is an American writer and conservative commentator.While she was in high school, she received a number of racist phone calls that were later traced to a car in which the son of Governor Dannel Malloy was present.Candace’s family sued the Stamford Board of Education and won a $37,500 settlement.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university.

How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Who is Shawn Mendes?

She is said to be \u0027deeply unhappy\u0027 that she is not on the guest list for Harry and Meghan\u0027s second private evening wedding receptionThe Duchess of York is said to be ‘deeply unhappy’ after being left off the Royal Family’s ‘inner sanctum’ guest list for this month’s royal wedding.Prince Andrew’s ex-wife is among 600 guests invited to the ceremony in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19 and to the reception that is being held afterwards in St George’s Hall, it can be confirmed.But while Andrew and their children, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, have also been sent coveted invitations for a second, private evening reception for 250 being thrown by Prince Charles for the couple, Sarah is most definitely off the guest list for that.According to sources, the 58-year-old duchess has been complaining about the ‘snub’ to anyone who will listen – even though many in the royal households think she should count herself lucky to be going at all. Prince Harry personally intervened to make sure she had an invitation to his wedding to Meghan Markle and the first reception after years in the royal wilderness.It is understood that Sarah has already been introduced to Meghan by Harry, who is close to his cousins Beatrice and Eugenie, but it is thought that Charles, who is paying for the evening reception at Frogmore House, doesn’t approve.An insider said: ‘Numbers are limited to the evening party, she is not a member of the Royal Family any more and Prince Charles simply doesn’t have time for her. \u0027He just can’t see why she is still such a big part of his brother’s life.’Prince Harry\u0027s bid to be first royal to serve on the...Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars enlist the help of the show\u0027s...Share this articleThe duchess wasn’t invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 2011 wedding at Westminster Abbey, which was a much larger occasion than Harry and Meghan’s ‘intimate’ family ceremony, and took herself off to a spa in Thailand to lick her wounds.While relations have thawed enough in recent years for Sarah to be invited to a small number of occasions, such as Royal Ascot and the family’s summer sojourn at Balmoral, even the Queen has to take care that she doesn’t appear when Prince Philip is around.He is said to hold a deep-seated grudge against the duchess for the embarrassments he feels she has heaped upon his family over the years, once memorably describing her as ‘having no point’.

Prince Charles is throwing the second reception for Harry and Meghan. He reportedly doesn\u0027t want Sarah to attendOne source said: ‘It will be fascinating to see if the Duke of Edinburgh acknowledges her. \u0027He has held a grudge against her for a long, long time and normally refuses to even be in the same room as her.’Earlier this year the Daily Mail told how Sarah had been invited to the wedding, contrary to reports that she had been banned, but the situation had caused a ‘massive headache’ behind the scenes.Senior royals, led by Charles and Philip, had made no bones about the fact that they didn’t want the duchess there, but Harry, who is fond of her, held his ground.He has kept in touch with his aunt over the years, and has previously holidayed at the Swiss ski chalet she bought for an estimated £13million a few years ago with her former husband. ‘He absolutely, 100 per cent wants her there and has told palace officials that in no uncertain terms,’ a source said.Despite their 1996 orce, Sarah and Andrew remain extremely close and live at Royal Lodge, his Windsor home, together. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/23/4BED49A700000578-0-image-m-20_1525646031347.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury takes inspiration Stormzy preparing Harry Meghans wedding","story":"    The Archbishop of Canterbury is taking inspiration from a Stormzy song to prepare for officiating the royal wedding.

But as supermarkets fight to win back shoppers from internet delivery firms such as Amazon, the idea is being revived – with a hi-tech twist.Sainsbury’s is testing a fleet of electric, battery powered bikes, which are capable of delivering your entire weekly shop. The five bikes will deliver up to 100 online orders a day within a three-mile radius of the chain’s Streatham store in south London.The purpose-built e-bikes can hold 280 litres of groceries in a compartment on the front and another 130 litres at the back.

Supermarkets hope that by making shops more innovative and attractive, they won’t lose customers.However, one regular shopper wasn’t sold on Waitrose’s new service.‘In what world is slicing and carving bespoke?’ she said. ‘We are not asking staff to knock out a three-piece suit made from prosciutto and olives … I just can’t take this seriously.’But a Waitrose spokesman said sales had been ‘strong’ so far, with the Iberico ham the ‘best seller’. And M\u0026ampS: Not just any eye testMarks and Spencer is set to install opticians in its stores in its latest attempt to lure shoppers away from the internet and through its doors.The high street chain will sell glasses and eye tests at five of its shops.

One of the year\u0027s first harvests had been planned for this weekend.\u0027If we lose our farm, we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going to go. You lose your income and you lose your home at the same time,\u0027 said McArthur, who\u0027s had the farm for about 20 years. \u0027All you can do is pray and hope and try to get all the information you can.\u0027About 250 people and 90 pets spent Saturday night at shelters, the American Red Cross said.The number of lava-venting fissures in the neighborhood grew overnight from eight to as many as 10, Stovall said, though some have quieted at various points. Regardless, USGS scientists expect fissures to keep spewing.The lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in some previous Hawaii eruptions, Stovall said.Kilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983.The USGS\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what\u0027s known as the East Rift Zone.

Until Sunday when, for the first time in more than a decade, they met.She said the now 17-year-old young woman was shaking like a leaf. They spent the afternoon together, and Jane told me: \u0027Just seeing her sitting on my sofa – actually sitting there – was unbelievable, magic.\u0027 Then her granddaughter gave her that message of love.Unemployment could be set to fall to levels not seen since...Baroness Joan Bakewell claims the NHS is discriminating...Share this articleListening to the quiet joy in Jane\u0027s voice as she described her magical afternoon, I found tears filling my own eyes.As with many grandparents, the cause of the family split was a orce. Her son and his wife had broken up, and she\u0027d lost contact with her granddaughter.They were forbidden from meeting, writing or speaking to each other, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.She\u0027d tried hard to stay calm, neutral, not to interfere and bide her time, but years of silence and stalemate were hard to endure.For years Jane has kept one memory alive in her heart, of her granddaughter, aged seven, sitting in the back of her car: \u0027I could see her, her blue eyes shining, a smile as broad as the Earth, as she waved goodbye.\u0027This enforced separation is a source of heartbreak for so many grandparents, and grandchildren, and something I have campaigned against for many years.At the last count, in 2016, around 2,000 grandparents went to court to try to fight for the right to see their grandchildren – an expensive, frustrating and harrowing act borne of desperation. And without the rights of grandparents enshrined in law, often ultimately futile. And these were the lucky ones, who could afford to hire professional help.That is why I was overjoyed this week to hear that these voices are finally being listened to.          Jane Jackson hasn\u0027t seen her granddaughter since she was seven. Pictured, Jane with her granddaughter in 2007Parliament is to look at a change to the Children Act 1989, which could establish a \u0027presumption\u0027 that grandparents (and uncles and aunts) have a right to see their grandchildren, nieces and nephews, after the children\u0027s parents break up.Jane, 66, and her husband Marc founded the Bristol Grandparents Support Group – of which I am patron – offering support to others in the same, sad situation. \u0027I preach to the others that they should never give up hope. But the truth is I gave up hope years ago,\u0027 she admits. \u0027So if it can happen for us, it can happen for anyone.\u0027I am yet to hear Jane\u0027s full story, of how she finally broke through to her granddaughter, but having spent a glorious Bank Holiday weekend with two of my grandsons, I know how precious this contact is. If anyone told me I could never see my grandchildren again, I would feel as if my heart had been plucked out of my chest. We have such fun together. I may be far too lenient, I may spoil them terribly, but that\u0027s my role as a grandparent.I remember the same warm, easy love from my own grandmother. When as a teenager I ran away from home after a stupid row with my mother, I rang Granny and told her I was going to spend the night with her.She made a slap-up tea for me and sent me home the next morning. Years later, when she needed eye surgery, I stayed with her to put the drops into her eyes. I treasure the little crystal bow brooch she left me in her will. I named my oldest daughter, Emily, after her. Her love of children inspired me – I still remember how they clustered around her. And what angers and distresses me is the knowledge that thousands of today\u0027s children have been cut off from what should be the heart and soul of a family: the grandparents. That is why I see this proposed change in the law as not so much a victory for grandparents, but for grandchildren.Of course, circumstances do exist where it is in the child\u0027s best interests not to be in contact with a grandparent, but to deny them this precious relationship needlessly feels pointlessly cruel and almost sadistic.Both grandparents and grandchildren have written to me in their hundreds. They\u0027ve tearfully told me of Christmas cards and birthday presents returned, of grandparents being warned by the police that they were \u0027stalking\u0027 by trying to send letters and gifts. One grandmother said: \u0027The police arrived, read the riot act to me and left me sobbing behind a closed door.\u0027Jane knows of several grandparents who actually took their own lives. Many grandparents have described their loss as \u0027a living bereavement\u0027, knowing that their grandchildren are alive but prevented from even sending them a simple loving message.Why does this terrible split in a family happen? Often, but not always, it\u0027s due to a bitter orce or separation. Sometimes it even happens when one partner dies, a time when the whole family needs to comfort and support each other. And yet a grandmother told me that when her daughter died of breast cancer, \u0027as soon as she passed away her husband pushed us out of the children\u0027s lives. When my daughter died it was a double loss – you have the loss of your daughter to deal with and the loss of no contact with your grandchildren. We have no rights. No power. No voice.\u0027This proposed change in the law could see an end to that. Jane, who for many years worked as a teaching assistant for children with special needs, says there is still a long way to go.She told me: \u0027Meeting my granddaughter is not the end of the story, it\u0027s just the beginning. We must keep up the pressure on MPs to change the law.\u0027 Recently I was able to introduce Jane to Nigel Huddleston MP, who held a debate last Wednesday, and MPs from every party joined the cause. Now Lucy Frazer, a minister in the Justice Department, has promised to look at this very simple change to the Children Act.          Dame Esther Rantzen is pictured with her grandchildren Alexander, two, and Benji, fiveThis is not a law to take sides in a orce, or weaponise warring parents. This is a change in the law designed to protect and support children who need and long for that precious inter- generational relationship.For some, alas, it is too late. Michael, aged 29, bitterly regrets the loss of his grandparents. He wrote to me: \u0027My grandmother died when I was 12. We were not allowed to go to her funeral. My grandfather tried the legal route, and found he had no rights whatsoever.\u0027My grandfather died when I was 16. Again we were not allowed to attend the funeral. I remember asking my mum if I could see him before he died. I was not allowed. I feel a sense of deep loss, guilt and regret. As a child you are powerless to insist that you see your grandparents, however much you may want to.\u0027French law gives children that power. But when British grandparents as a last resort do go to the courts to ask for access, all too often it costs thousands of pounds to no avail.The simple addition to the Children Act which is proposed would not only change attitudes in our courts, but perhaps also in parents. No matter how bitter a separation is, surely the children should be given as much security as possible, and the continuity of a grandparent\u0027s love can be healing when a child is in real pain.As one grandson wrote to me: \u0027The summers that I shared with my grandparents are the most memorable in my life. However, things changed when I was nine or ten. That\u0027s when my parents\u0027 relationship became a bit rocky. My grandmother still sends letters and occasionally we speak on the phone… I do miss them very much, and hope that some day I will be able to visit them again.\u0027So I do hope Miss Frazer recognizes this is not about grandparents\u0027 rights, it is to protect and support grandchildren. Thousands who are suffering a \u0027living bereavement\u0027 need the support of the law.And one day many others, like Jane Jackson, will be able to rejoice in that simple message that means so much: \u0027Grandma, grandpa, I love you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF341BE00000578-0-image-m-24_1525730890119.jpg","title":"Thousands children asked scientists predict futures right","story":"Sally Seth-Smith assumed she would become a nurse. It was only later, while at her small comprehensive school in Cumbria, she realised she might be able to become a doctor‘My mum was a nurse and my dad was a doctor, so I was always very interested in medical stuff.\u0027I used to have a permanent hospital for my dolls and teddies set up in my bedroom, where I would do ward rounds, check their temperature and stuff like that.‘As long as I could remember, I had wanted to be a nurse and then someone said to me “You might be clever enough to become a doctor”, and I thought “Gosh, can girls be doctors?”‘Men were doctors and women were nurses, and that was absolutely how it felt then.’But a seed had been planted and Sally, who settled in Hampshire, has now been a GP for 30 years. YouTube stars are trading in children\u0027s sexual misery by...Mother warns over shocking new playground craze The...Share this articleTwo of her children are also doctors, and her youngest son works in finance.

Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie Adkins\u0027 dreams. Today, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandsonToday, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandson. She wonders whether she wrote so little because she was so certain where she would be at 25.‘I was always going to be a hairdresser,’ says Jackie. ‘I used to cut my own hair and my mum’s and I used to carry my hairdressing scissors in my school bag and at lunchtime the girls would say “can you do my fringe for me?” or “can you put layers in my hair?”’Jackie loved her secondary school in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, one of the brand-new comprehensives, and was among the first year to start when it opened in 1969.She had a place to study at hairdressing college when, aged 16, her parents moved to Sussex, and her dreams were shelved. She found herself working in a bank because her parents could not afford to support her through college.Her father had a heart attack and died when Jackie was just 19, so her income was even more essential and thoughts of going to hairdressing college faded.She remains wistful about the career that might have been — she still cuts her grown-up children’s hair and one of her daughters is a hairdresser — but Jackie says: ‘Once I got into the cycle of earning money, it was so hard to break away from that.’Jackie left banking after the birth of her second child and since then has done everything from selling candles to catering for parties and working for a mining recruitment company.But today, after surgery for a benign tumour in her stomach, Jackie is ‘enjoying taking life a little slower’, while helping her builder husband with his books from their home in Lancing, West Sussex.‘It’s time to do the things we couldn’t do when the kids were younger,’ she says. ‘I’m off to Amsterdam soon, going to do a Scandinavian boat tour in the summer and next year we are hoping to go to Cuba.’  All I knew was that I didn\u0027t want to be like my father Looking back, Steve Christmas is all too aware of the poignancy of his essay.Writing about his grown-up life, he predicted he would be a ‘sargant’ (sic) in the police with a wife named Jane, a new surname (Stephensone), a house in Wales and four children.The new surname and life in Wales were, he suspects, because he wanted to get as far away as possible from Harwich, Essex, where his parents ran a café and sweet shop.  Steve Christmas\u0027 father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons. He promised himself he wouldn\u0027t ever be like himSteve’s father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons.‘I didn’t want to be me,’ says Steve, who now lives in Eastbourne with wife Sue, 57, a PA for the NHS, whom he met on holiday aged 21. ‘I wanted to be this other person.’School was also miserable for Steve. ‘I wasn’t very clever,’ he says. ‘There was too much else going on in my life. I think today someone would have noticed.’He left school with no qualifications aged 15, and moved with his family to Rye, East Sussex, where he worked as a farm labourer, until his father went bankrupt and uprooted them all again to nearby Hastings. ‘I remember making a conscious decision that I wasn’t going to be like my father,’ he says.Steve didn’t become a policeman — he realised before leaving school that at 5ft 9in he wasn’t tall enough and that he would struggle to pass the exams he needed.Instead, several years later, he started working for an insurance company, and studied at night to pass his vocational exams, discovering he was actually quite bright after all.Fatherhood came late for Steve. After leaving home at 31 to marry Sue, they eventually had daughter Emma, now 23, through IVF, thanks to Professor Robert Winston. ‘All I wanted when I was 11 was structure, to be happy, have children and for them to be happy, and that’s what has happened,’ smiles Steve, who took early retirement before setting up his own business writing wills.As for his father, he died in 2003, a year after Steve’s mother.‘That last year I learned a lot about him,’ says Steve. ‘I stopped him drinking so much, stopped him smoking. Before he died he gave me a big cuddle, which he had never done, he apologised and said: “I’m really sorry for what I’ve done.” \u0027Life’s too short to stay bitter. What happens in your childhood doesn’t have to hold you back.’  My dream was dashed but I still feel like that little boyNigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school.His was a happy childhood with his three siblings and parents. ‘My dad married at 18 and was working class. He did lots of different things, and ended up doing admin for a bus company,’ recalls Nigel.   Nigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school. He dreamed of being a soldier but failed the medical because he had a lazy eye‘But if he had ten bob in his pocket he’d take us out on the weekend.’ There were sailing trips, horseriding and countryside jaunts.Aged 11, Nigel dreamed of being a soldier. Visualising life at 25 he wrote: ‘I do not spend much time at home because I travel a lot abroad. At the moment I have a job as corpral (sic) in the army. \u0027There is a lot of drill and hard work in it but we do have some pleasure time we go to the pictures and have dances.’Sadly, Nigel’s dreams of joining the Armed Forces were not to be.Leaving school at 16, he did attempt to join the RAF. ‘I went to the recruitment office in Brighton and did all the exams. \u0027I was told I had one of the best English comprehension test papers they’d ever had, but then I went for the medical and failed because I had a minor eye defect, a “lazy” eye.’Naturally optimistic, he is not regretful but feels he missed out on a ‘career’. While clever enough to get his English and Maths O-levels a year early, he spent much of his working life in different jobs, before becoming a carpenter.Now semi-retired, but looking for a part-time job, he is mortgage free and enjoying life near Lewes, East Sussex, with his wife Caroline, a civil servant.His hobby is classic cars — and he’s been an MG Owners Club member for 35 years.‘I’d be a rich man if it wasn’t for cars and bikes,’ he jokes. ‘I still feel much younger than I am, I’ve never lost that. Mentally I’m still 12.’  I was bored with the workday grind even then! Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job.He wrote: ‘The alarm clock goes for the start of another day. Another day of work at the office. How boring all I do is sit reading books . . . Why couldn’t I be a miner instead of a lawjer (sic) (who doesn’t do a thing).’In the event, he became a journalist, and while he doesn’t remember his childhood ambitions, he recognises his love of language and sardonic outlook in the essay.  Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job. But he went on to become a journalist and remembers his love of language as a child‘My wife saw it and laughed and said that explains a lot,’ says Paul, a father-of-three who has four grandchildren. ‘For an 11-year-old there’s quite a dose of cynicism in there. And I always enjoyed creative writing and English.’Paul grew up on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, living with his four siblings, his mum’s younger half brother and his parents — eight of them squeezed into a three-bedroom council house while his dad worked for Pilkington, the glass manufacturer.‘I think I got my dad’s graft and my mum’s brightness. In a different time she would have gone to university, but she was a full-time mum until we all got older,’ says Paul. He took a degree in business studies but, as soon as he finished, he followed his older brother to work on a local newspaper.‘Before my degree, I never had it in my head that I would become a reporter,’ he says. ‘But when a junior reporter’s job came up on the local paper, I never looked back.’Paul, who confesses he has had a rewarding working life, still lives on Sheppey, with fitness instructor wife Amanda and works part-time at the Daily Mail. One son has followed in his father’s footsteps, one is a carpenter and the third has learning difficulties and lives in a nearby care home."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF3F34300000578-0-image-a-9_1525731672349.jpg","title":"RICHARD LITTLEJOHN time Nonce Finder General dock","story":"    When he\u0027s not trying to shackle our free Press, or cosying up to the odious Max Mosley — from whom he has accepted £540,000 in donations — Tom Watson can be found pursuing a deranged vendetta against senior Tories he accuses of sex crimes. In a harrowing interview in Saturday\u0027s Mail, Sue Reid spoke to a young couple caught up in the madness who were threatened with the prospect of their baby daughter being taken away from them.Their only \u0027crime\u0027 was to live in a two-bedroom flat in the same building as ex-Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was wrongly accused of three counts of murder, child sex abuse and male rape.In February 2015, police and social services turned up at the property, on the Duke of Rutland\u0027s estate in Leicestershire, and ordered Adam and Charlotte Coxon to move out immediately.MasterChef contestant Aldo Ortado is revealed as a...Madonna, Cindy Crawford and Katharine McPhee get ready for...DJ Simon Mayo who earns £400,000 a year believes BBC...Met Gala 2018: Heavenly bodies!

But they were responsible for just 9,000 over-run days.Councils typically carry out roadworks to resurface roads, fill in potholes, add ‘traffic-calming’ measures such as speed bumps, or to change the road layout. Some of these projects can be longer and more prone to delays. Utility firms dig up the roads to carry out repairs to infrastructure such as gas pipes and water mains, or to lay new pipes and broadband cable.          Roadworks carried out by councils between April and July last year lasted for 4.2 million days, or 68 per cent of the totalThe damning figures are contained in the latest ‘England and Wales performance scorecard’ report published by the Highways Authorities and Utilities Committee. The organisation collects data from highway authorities run by town halls, as well utility firms and the Government. It was set up to ensure roadworks are carried out safely and to help minimise the impact on the public.Mr King said: ‘While roadworks are essential, delayed roadworks are the bane of drivers’ lives – they waste their time, money and test their patience. While gas, water and cable companies are often blamed, it appears from these figures that the performance of local highway authorities is far worse and that they have taken their eye off the ball.

It sells some toys already, but tends to focus on a smaller selection of gifts rather than popular brands such as Lego.Opening concessions is the latest bid by the retailer to woo high street shoppers. Last year M\u0026ampS partnered with Japanese chain Wasabi to open sushi counters in food halls.A spokesman for M\u0026ampS said the optician trial, which will be run by a third party, was part of its five-year plan to rejuvenate the business. The opticians will operate at stores in Bolton, York, Derby, Manchester and London’s Westfield White City.M\u0026ampS has struggled with shoppers’ changing tastes and the rise of internet rivals in recent years, forcing it to shut stores and cut hundreds of jobs.Last month it ditched its own-brand baby food and replaced it with organic label Ella’s Kitchen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/22/4BF3EE1A00000578-5701229-image-a-4_1525730041297.jpg","title":"Incredible footage shows terrifying wall lava crawling Hawaii road","story":"    Stunning timelapse footage has captured the moment a wall of lava slowly advanced across a Hawaii road amid mass eruptions across the island          Red hot lava flows engulfed homes, trees, cars and streets - with nothing able to stem the inevitable advance of molten rock          Timelapse video footage shows one stream on lava as it crawled across a street, towards a parked car          The car disappears behind the wall of lava as flames erupt from the parked vehicle          The white mustang later erupts in flames before being entirely consumed by the lava          The impenetrable wall of lava blocked the entire road,  in the Leilani Estates neighborhood in the aftermath of eruptions           Another photo shows the lava stream about to devour a metal gate temporarily blocking its path          Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano has already destroyed 35 homes and buildings and forced 1,700 people to leave their residences since it erupted on Thursday, spewing lava and toxic gas from volcanic vents in a small area of Hawaii\u0027s Big Island                                                    Flames could be seen erupting from the red coals as smoke and steam billowed above it.Residents have been warned to \u0027go now\u0027 before more homes are destroyed. \u0027Be prepared to evacuate at a moment\u0027s notice,\u0027 the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said in an alert on its website.

One of the year\u0027s first harvests had been planned for this weekend.\u0027If we lose our farm, we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going to go. You lose your income and you lose your home at the same time,\u0027 said McArthur, who\u0027s had the farm for about 20 years. \u0027All you can do is pray and hope and try to get all the information you can.\u0027About 250 people and 90 pets spent Saturday night at shelters, the American Red Cross said.The number of lava-venting fissures in the neighborhood grew overnight from eight to as many as 10, Stovall said, though some have quieted at various points. Regardless, USGS scientists expect fissures to keep spewing.The lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in some previous Hawaii eruptions, Stovall said.Kilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983.The USGS\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what\u0027s known as the East Rift Zone.

Until Sunday when, for the first time in more than a decade, they met.She said the now 17-year-old young woman was shaking like a leaf. They spent the afternoon together, and Jane told me: \u0027Just seeing her sitting on my sofa – actually sitting there – was unbelievable, magic.\u0027 Then her granddaughter gave her that message of love.Unemployment could be set to fall to levels not seen since...Baroness Joan Bakewell claims the NHS is discriminating...Share this articleListening to the quiet joy in Jane\u0027s voice as she described her magical afternoon, I found tears filling my own eyes.As with many grandparents, the cause of the family split was a orce. Her son and his wife had broken up, and she\u0027d lost contact with her granddaughter.They were forbidden from meeting, writing or speaking to each other, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.She\u0027d tried hard to stay calm, neutral, not to interfere and bide her time, but years of silence and stalemate were hard to endure.For years Jane has kept one memory alive in her heart, of her granddaughter, aged seven, sitting in the back of her car: \u0027I could see her, her blue eyes shining, a smile as broad as the Earth, as she waved goodbye.\u0027This enforced separation is a source of heartbreak for so many grandparents, and grandchildren, and something I have campaigned against for many years.At the last count, in 2016, around 2,000 grandparents went to court to try to fight for the right to see their grandchildren – an expensive, frustrating and harrowing act borne of desperation. And without the rights of grandparents enshrined in law, often ultimately futile. And these were the lucky ones, who could afford to hire professional help.That is why I was overjoyed this week to hear that these voices are finally being listened to.          Jane Jackson hasn\u0027t seen her granddaughter since she was seven. Pictured, Jane with her granddaughter in 2007Parliament is to look at a change to the Children Act 1989, which could establish a \u0027presumption\u0027 that grandparents (and uncles and aunts) have a right to see their grandchildren, nieces and nephews, after the children\u0027s parents break up.Jane, 66, and her husband Marc founded the Bristol Grandparents Support Group – of which I am patron – offering support to others in the same, sad situation. \u0027I preach to the others that they should never give up hope. But the truth is I gave up hope years ago,\u0027 she admits. \u0027So if it can happen for us, it can happen for anyone.\u0027I am yet to hear Jane\u0027s full story, of how she finally broke through to her granddaughter, but having spent a glorious Bank Holiday weekend with two of my grandsons, I know how precious this contact is. If anyone told me I could never see my grandchildren again, I would feel as if my heart had been plucked out of my chest. We have such fun together. I may be far too lenient, I may spoil them terribly, but that\u0027s my role as a grandparent.I remember the same warm, easy love from my own grandmother. When as a teenager I ran away from home after a stupid row with my mother, I rang Granny and told her I was going to spend the night with her.She made a slap-up tea for me and sent me home the next morning. Years later, when she needed eye surgery, I stayed with her to put the drops into her eyes. I treasure the little crystal bow brooch she left me in her will. I named my oldest daughter, Emily, after her. Her love of children inspired me – I still remember how they clustered around her. And what angers and distresses me is the knowledge that thousands of today\u0027s children have been cut off from what should be the heart and soul of a family: the grandparents. That is why I see this proposed change in the law as not so much a victory for grandparents, but for grandchildren.Of course, circumstances do exist where it is in the child\u0027s best interests not to be in contact with a grandparent, but to deny them this precious relationship needlessly feels pointlessly cruel and almost sadistic.Both grandparents and grandchildren have written to me in their hundreds. They\u0027ve tearfully told me of Christmas cards and birthday presents returned, of grandparents being warned by the police that they were \u0027stalking\u0027 by trying to send letters and gifts. One grandmother said: \u0027The police arrived, read the riot act to me and left me sobbing behind a closed door.\u0027Jane knows of several grandparents who actually took their own lives. Many grandparents have described their loss as \u0027a living bereavement\u0027, knowing that their grandchildren are alive but prevented from even sending them a simple loving message.Why does this terrible split in a family happen? Often, but not always, it\u0027s due to a bitter orce or separation. Sometimes it even happens when one partner dies, a time when the whole family needs to comfort and support each other. And yet a grandmother told me that when her daughter died of breast cancer, \u0027as soon as she passed away her husband pushed us out of the children\u0027s lives. When my daughter died it was a double loss – you have the loss of your daughter to deal with and the loss of no contact with your grandchildren. We have no rights. No power. No voice.\u0027This proposed change in the law could see an end to that. Jane, who for many years worked as a teaching assistant for children with special needs, says there is still a long way to go.She told me: \u0027Meeting my granddaughter is not the end of the story, it\u0027s just the beginning. We must keep up the pressure on MPs to change the law.\u0027 Recently I was able to introduce Jane to Nigel Huddleston MP, who held a debate last Wednesday, and MPs from every party joined the cause. Now Lucy Frazer, a minister in the Justice Department, has promised to look at this very simple change to the Children Act.          Dame Esther Rantzen is pictured with her grandchildren Alexander, two, and Benji, fiveThis is not a law to take sides in a orce, or weaponise warring parents. This is a change in the law designed to protect and support children who need and long for that precious inter- generational relationship.For some, alas, it is too late. Michael, aged 29, bitterly regrets the loss of his grandparents. He wrote to me: \u0027My grandmother died when I was 12. We were not allowed to go to her funeral. My grandfather tried the legal route, and found he had no rights whatsoever.\u0027My grandfather died when I was 16. Again we were not allowed to attend the funeral. I remember asking my mum if I could see him before he died. I was not allowed. I feel a sense of deep loss, guilt and regret. As a child you are powerless to insist that you see your grandparents, however much you may want to.\u0027French law gives children that power. But when British grandparents as a last resort do go to the courts to ask for access, all too often it costs thousands of pounds to no avail.The simple addition to the Children Act which is proposed would not only change attitudes in our courts, but perhaps also in parents. No matter how bitter a separation is, surely the children should be given as much security as possible, and the continuity of a grandparent\u0027s love can be healing when a child is in real pain.As one grandson wrote to me: \u0027The summers that I shared with my grandparents are the most memorable in my life. However, things changed when I was nine or ten. That\u0027s when my parents\u0027 relationship became a bit rocky. My grandmother still sends letters and occasionally we speak on the phone… I do miss them very much, and hope that some day I will be able to visit them again.\u0027So I do hope Miss Frazer recognizes this is not about grandparents\u0027 rights, it is to protect and support grandchildren. Thousands who are suffering a \u0027living bereavement\u0027 need the support of the law.And one day many others, like Jane Jackson, will be able to rejoice in that simple message that means so much: \u0027Grandma, grandpa, I love you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF341BE00000578-0-image-m-24_1525730890119.jpg","title":"Thousands children asked scientists predict futures right","story":"Sally Seth-Smith assumed she would become a nurse. It was only later, while at her small comprehensive school in Cumbria, she realised she might be able to become a doctor‘My mum was a nurse and my dad was a doctor, so I was always very interested in medical stuff.\u0027I used to have a permanent hospital for my dolls and teddies set up in my bedroom, where I would do ward rounds, check their temperature and stuff like that.‘As long as I could remember, I had wanted to be a nurse and then someone said to me “You might be clever enough to become a doctor”, and I thought “Gosh, can girls be doctors?”‘Men were doctors and women were nurses, and that was absolutely how it felt then.’But a seed had been planted and Sally, who settled in Hampshire, has now been a GP for 30 years. YouTube stars are trading in children\u0027s sexual misery by...Mother warns over shocking new playground craze The...Share this articleTwo of her children are also doctors, and her youngest son works in finance. She has two grandchildren. Sally smiles as she reads back her childhood dreams of a world where 2,000 people live on the moon, ‘England is like Switzerland with no fighting’, ‘the Russians no longer invade other countries’ and ‘the whole world is running out of food’.‘It is just so me socially, politically and ecologically aware — a lot of what I’m passionate about now, but I had no idea I had that sort of understanding or thoughts when I was 11,’ she says.But as eloquent as her essay is, Sally’s recollections of that time are tinged with sadness.Not long after she’d written her essay, Sally’s mother committed suicide. She had discovered that her husband was having an affair with one of her friends. Sally and her three younger brothers were almost immediately uprooted and taken to Cumbria by their father, who never discussed their mother’s death.It was only later that they began to piece together what had happened in their parents’ lives. ‘I was probably well into my mid-20s before I could really talk about it,’ says Sally, who has been married to her second husband Nigel, an electronics engineer, for nearly 20 years.    I still regret money woes killed off my ideal career Jackie Adkins laughs as she re-reads the three paragraphs that constituted her idea of an ‘essay’.‘I work in a hair dressers and looking for a shop (sic) when I have saved up some money I will buy one,’ she wrote. Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie’s dreams.  Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie Adkins\u0027 dreams. Today, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandsonToday, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandson. She wonders whether she wrote so little because she was so certain where she would be at 25.‘I was always going to be a hairdresser,’ says Jackie. ‘I used to cut my own hair and my mum’s and I used to carry my hairdressing scissors in my school bag and at lunchtime the girls would say “can you do my fringe for me?” or “can you put layers in my hair?”’Jackie loved her secondary school in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, one of the brand-new comprehensives, and was among the first year to start when it opened in 1969.She had a place to study at hairdressing college when, aged 16, her parents moved to Sussex, and her dreams were shelved. She found herself working in a bank because her parents could not afford to support her through college.Her father had a heart attack and died when Jackie was just 19, so her income was even more essential and thoughts of going to hairdressing college faded.She remains wistful about the career that might have been — she still cuts her grown-up children’s hair and one of her daughters is a hairdresser — but Jackie says: ‘Once I got into the cycle of earning money, it was so hard to break away from that.’Jackie left banking after the birth of her second child and since then has done everything from selling candles to catering for parties and working for a mining recruitment company.But today, after surgery for a benign tumour in her stomach, Jackie is ‘enjoying taking life a little slower’, while helping her builder husband with his books from their home in Lancing, West Sussex.‘It’s time to do the things we couldn’t do when the kids were younger,’ she says. ‘I’m off to Amsterdam soon, going to do a Scandinavian boat tour in the summer and next year we are hoping to go to Cuba.’  All I knew was that I didn\u0027t want to be like my father Looking back, Steve Christmas is all too aware of the poignancy of his essay.Writing about his grown-up life, he predicted he would be a ‘sargant’ (sic) in the police with a wife named Jane, a new surname (Stephensone), a house in Wales and four children.The new surname and life in Wales were, he suspects, because he wanted to get as far away as possible from Harwich, Essex, where his parents ran a café and sweet shop.  Steve Christmas\u0027 father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons. He promised himself he wouldn\u0027t ever be like himSteve’s father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons.‘I didn’t want to be me,’ says Steve, who now lives in Eastbourne with wife Sue, 57, a PA for the NHS, whom he met on holiday aged 21. ‘I wanted to be this other person.’School was also miserable for Steve. ‘I wasn’t very clever,’ he says. ‘There was too much else going on in my life. I think today someone would have noticed.’He left school with no qualifications aged 15, and moved with his family to Rye, East Sussex, where he worked as a farm labourer, until his father went bankrupt and uprooted them all again to nearby Hastings. ‘I remember making a conscious decision that I wasn’t going to be like my father,’ he says.Steve didn’t become a policeman — he realised before leaving school that at 5ft 9in he wasn’t tall enough and that he would struggle to pass the exams he needed.Instead, several years later, he started working for an insurance company, and studied at night to pass his vocational exams, discovering he was actually quite bright after all.Fatherhood came late for Steve. After leaving home at 31 to marry Sue, they eventually had daughter Emma, now 23, through IVF, thanks to Professor Robert Winston. ‘All I wanted when I was 11 was structure, to be happy, have children and for them to be happy, and that’s what has happened,’ smiles Steve, who took early retirement before setting up his own business writing wills.As for his father, he died in 2003, a year after Steve’s mother.‘That last year I learned a lot about him,’ says Steve. ‘I stopped him drinking so much, stopped him smoking. Before he died he gave me a big cuddle, which he had never done, he apologised and said: “I’m really sorry for what I’ve done.” \u0027Life’s too short to stay bitter. What happens in your childhood doesn’t have to hold you back.’  My dream was dashed but I still feel like that little boyNigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school.His was a happy childhood with his three siblings and parents. ‘My dad married at 18 and was working class. He did lots of different things, and ended up doing admin for a bus company,’ recalls Nigel.   Nigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school. He dreamed of being a soldier but failed the medical because he had a lazy eye‘But if he had ten bob in his pocket he’d take us out on the weekend.’ There were sailing trips, horseriding and countryside jaunts.Aged 11, Nigel dreamed of being a soldier. Visualising life at 25 he wrote: ‘I do not spend much time at home because I travel a lot abroad. At the moment I have a job as corpral (sic) in the army. \u0027There is a lot of drill and hard work in it but we do have some pleasure time we go to the pictures and have dances.’Sadly, Nigel’s dreams of joining the Armed Forces were not to be.Leaving school at 16, he did attempt to join the RAF. ‘I went to the recruitment office in Brighton and did all the exams. \u0027I was told I had one of the best English comprehension test papers they’d ever had, but then I went for the medical and failed because I had a minor eye defect, a “lazy” eye.’Naturally optimistic, he is not regretful but feels he missed out on a ‘career’. While clever enough to get his English and Maths O-levels a year early, he spent much of his working life in different jobs, before becoming a carpenter.Now semi-retired, but looking for a part-time job, he is mortgage free and enjoying life near Lewes, East Sussex, with his wife Caroline, a civil servant.His hobby is classic cars — and he’s been an MG Owners Club member for 35 years.‘I’d be a rich man if it wasn’t for cars and bikes,’ he jokes. ‘I still feel much younger than I am, I’ve never lost that. Mentally I’m still 12.’  I was bored with the workday grind even then! Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job.He wrote: ‘The alarm clock goes for the start of another day. Another day of work at the office. How boring all I do is sit reading books . . . Why couldn’t I be a miner instead of a lawjer (sic) (who doesn’t do a thing).’In the event, he became a journalist, and while he doesn’t remember his childhood ambitions, he recognises his love of language and sardonic outlook in the essay.  Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job. But he went on to become a journalist and remembers his love of language as a child‘My wife saw it and laughed and said that explains a lot,’ says Paul, a father-of-three who has four grandchildren. ‘For an 11-year-old there’s quite a dose of cynicism in there. And I always enjoyed creative writing and English.’Paul grew up on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, living with his four siblings, his mum’s younger half brother and his parents — eight of them squeezed into a three-bedroom council house while his dad worked for Pilkington, the glass manufacturer.‘I think I got my dad’s graft and my mum’s brightness. In a different time she would have gone to university, but she was a full-time mum until we all got older,’ says Paul. He took a degree in business studies but, as soon as he finished, he followed his older brother to work on a local newspaper.‘Before my degree, I never had it in my head that I would become a reporter,’ he says. ‘But when a junior reporter’s job came up on the local paper, I never looked back.’Paul, who confesses he has had a rewarding working life, still lives on Sheppey, with fitness instructor wife Amanda and works part-time at the Daily Mail. One son has followed in his father’s footsteps, one is a carpenter and the third has learning difficulties and lives in a nearby care home."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/01/4BF3AFED00000578-5701711-image-a-17_1525740008184.jpg","title":"All aboard Sailor finds ingenious way climb ship Hailuoto Finland moving","story":"    With no life jacket on, the sailor waits until the perfect moment to cling onto a rope ladder and climb through a small hatch on the side of the cargo shipHe casually enters the door and the freighter continues on its journey to the snowy Port of Oulu.As the video begins, the man in a high-viz jacket waits by the metal bridge with a colleague.When the vessel gets closer they grab the pontoon and push it so it hangs over the waters - which has a thick layer of melted ice on top.    After pushing a metal bridge over the water he waited on the edge until the rope ladder presented itself in front of him before clinging on and boarding the freighter          He performed the daring stunt off the coast of Hailuoto in Finland where the land is covered in ice and snow          The high-viz crew wait for the massive ship to get close enough before pushing the pontoon over the waterOne worker then holds the bridge while his friend makes his way to the edge, where he rocks back and forth in anticipation.With one hand he clutches the ladder as soon as it lines up directly in front of him and enters the boat, making it look easy in the process. As the video ends the camera pans out and reveals the vast amounts of snow surrounding the ship.

Often this is because workmen fail to resurface the road to the required specifications.The delays are particularly irritating for motorists who notice little improvement in their crumbling local roads, which are often riddled with potholes.Mother of murdered 17-year-old scrubs his blood off the...Family of taxi driving grandfather, 57, who had \u0027a heart...Share this articleRoadworks carried out by councils between April and July last year lasted for 4.2 million days, or 68 per cent of the total. But they were responsible for 132,000 ‘over-run days’ – 94 per cent of the total.Utility firms carried out 1,965,000 days of roadworks – or 32 per cent of the total. But they were responsible for just 9,000 over-run days.Councils typically carry out roadworks to resurface roads, fill in potholes, add ‘traffic-calming’ measures such as speed bumps, or to change the road layout. Some of these projects can be longer and more prone to delays. Utility firms dig up the roads to carry out repairs to infrastructure such as gas pipes and water mains, or to lay new pipes and broadband cable.          Roadworks carried out by councils between April and July last year lasted for 4.2 million days, or 68 per cent of the totalThe damning figures are contained in the latest ‘England and Wales performance scorecard’ report published by the Highways Authorities and Utilities Committee. The organisation collects data from highway authorities run by town halls, as well utility firms and the Government. It was set up to ensure roadworks are carried out safely and to help minimise the impact on the public.Mr King said: ‘While roadworks are essential, delayed roadworks are the bane of drivers’ lives – they waste their time, money and test their patience. While gas, water and cable companies are often blamed, it appears from these figures that the performance of local highway authorities is far worse and that they have taken their eye off the ball. They need to get their house in order.’A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils tended to do longer-term roadworks which can more easily over-run, adding: ‘It can be misleading to compare data across councils and private companies.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/01/4BF4D57800000578-0-image-m-62_1525740209388.jpg","title":"Horrific moment five year old boy struck head cricket ball","story":"    Harry Butt, five, was left with a severe concussion, a swollen nose and eye, plus sight and hearing problems after the ball whizzed over the fence from a match being played at the Poole Grammar School in Dorset on Thursday          His mother Michelle said: \u0027We took him to A\u0026ampE and we were admitted to hospital.

The fact that it has broken down for young people should therefore concern us all.\u0027We need iniduals, businesses and the state to pull together to address this challenge, and lift the living standards of young and future generations.\u0027The commission also makes a series of other recommendations, including improving employment security, a £1 billion \u0027better jobs deal\u0027 to help struggling young people get into work and bolstered rights for renters.It found millennials, people born between 1981 and 2000, are earning the same as those born 15 years before them were at the same age and are only half as likely to own their home by age 30 as baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1965, were. Give millennials £10,000 each to tackle generation gap, says thinktank | Money | The Guardian"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/10/4BF81F4A00000578-5703017-Bogdan_Dochev_second_from_right_who_died_in_his_home_country_of_-a-1_1525773318101.jpg","title":"Linesman tormented decision let Maradona away Hand God goal","story":"    The linesman who let Maradona get away with his \u0027Hand of God\u0027 goal (pictured) against England was tormented by his decision until his death, his wife has revealed          Bogdan Dochev (second from right), who died in his home country of Bulgaria last year, admitted in 2014 that he had seen the Argentine punch the ball beyond England goalkeeper Peter Shilton (right, shaking hands with Maradona ahead of the 1986 World Cup quarter-final clash)After hoodwinking officials with his first handball effort, the attacking wizard dribbled past five England players in a brilliant solo effort.Following the handball, TV images showed Tunisian referee Bin Nasser running slowly backwards towards the centre of the pitch and looking at Dochev.

He had chosen the role because he felt he was becoming a “Bond slave” and the film was about as far away as possible from the cartoon smoothness of 007. Cannes wasn’t much interested in that distinction, however. Goldfinger had come out the previous year Thunderball was on its way. When Connery cruised the Croisette in an open-topped sports car it was Bond, “Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as the New York Times called him, the crowds wanted to see.Connery, for all his reluctance to identify with his character, clearly didn’t disappoint. Has he ever looked more Bondlike than in this picture? Eyebrow raised, catching the eye of a beautiful face in the crowd, keeping his head and his tailoring on point, while all around him are losing theirs. This was his first time at Cannes, but he knew exactly what Cannes demanded: it was the place actors had always come to act most like film stars.This year’s festival, which opens next week, will conjure similar images: the same spring Riviera light, the same rococo facades, the same paparazzi scrum around an icon. Just as the photograph of Connery harked back to the welcome and confected spectacle that the film festival represented after the war, so this year’s images will reference the less inhibited atmosphere of the 60s.

It came as Virgin Money, backed by Sir Richard Branson, said it was reviewing an all-share takeover approach worth £1.6bn from CYBG, the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank. A deal would bring together two of Britain’s biggest challenger banks.After being rebuffed four times, Takeda secured a recommendation from the Shire board by raising the amount of cash in its offer to $30.33 (£22.43). Shire shareholders will also receive 0.839 new Takeda shares for each share. The offer is worth £49.01 a share, about £5 more than Takeda’s initial bid in late March.The Shire chief executive, Flemming Ørnskov, said the deal was “in the best interests of shareholders and offers an opportunity to improve the lives of even more patients globally with rare and highly specialised conditions”.If it is approved by shareholders of both companies, Shire investors will own about half of the combined group, which will be listed on the Tokyo stock exchange. Up to three Shire directors will join the Takeda board.The deal, which will be the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, will give Takeda Shire’s lucrative rare diseases portfolio and is also expected to generate cost savings of at least £1bn. Susan Kilsby, the chair of Shire, said: “Over the last 30 years, Shire has become the global leader in treating rare diseases … With this combination, Shire helps create an even stronger biopharmaceutical company, with a robust R\u0026ampD pipeline and expanded global footprint.”Shire, founded in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986, makes ADHD drugs Adderall and Vyvanse and the dry-eye drops Xiidra, as well as treatments for rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but run from Boston and has shifted most of its operations from the UK to the US.In 2014, Shire came close to being taken over by US drugmaker AbbVie but the deal was scuppered by a US clampdown on tax inversions, through which American companies bought overseas businesses to secure a lower tax rate.

But will anyone else move in?Billboards promising another way of life have long clustered alongside the clogged highways of central Cairo. Advertisements for gated housing developments called “Regent’s Park”, “Beta Greens” or “Uptown” promise “360-degree greenery” and open spaces. One, on a busy and polluted central road, invites onlookers to “just breathe”.The promise of escape from the congestion of central Cairo to a new life 40km away on the city’s outskirts is fetishised for those able to afford it. Nowhere is this more clear than on the billboards advertising real estate in “Entrada”, a housing and commercial property development in Egypt’s new administrative capital, which is currently without a name. “Welcome to a supreme community,” proclaims one. The development is touted by its creators as “the entrance to a new city, a new lifestyle, a new community and a new worldwide centre of attraction”.The alternative capital will  700 sq km, making it almost as large as Singapore, and is intended to house a total of five million people. The plan shows an expanse of high-rises and residential buildings as well as a “government district” all stationed around a central “green river”, a combination of open water and planted greenery twice the size of New York’s Central Park.The project is designed to wipe clean the problems of Cairo, and build a glistening new future. Most government buildings, as well as those occupied by the Egyptian president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, are scheduled to move there in June 2019. Foreign embassies are also encouraged to relocate, and businesses will be lured to a central business district of 20 Chinese-built skyscrapers. But what will happen to the old city once the new capital takes root?If the government’s plans are successful, the move will leave behind a network of empty buildings, all owned by the same umbrella company as the new capital, and for which there is currently no plan. For the government, the new administrative capital represents a fresh start – but one that will draw wealth from the existing capital.During a visit to the site last October, journalists were invited to view the construction of Egypt’s largest church, a new cabinet building, and stood looking at a stagnant future ornamental pool as a pair of fighter jets conducted a ceremonial flyover. Pictures of Entrada show spacious villas next to snaking pools of water and advertise their proximity to the development’s 4km of theme parks and so-called natural terrain. A two-bedroom apartment – with “a view of water”, private gardens and a maids’ room – is listed for around £45,000. The spokesman for the project, Khaled El-Husseiny, resisted questions about the quantity of affordable housing available in the new capital and the average price of real estate. “Forget the numbers, they’re not important and not fixed,” he said, frustrated. “We have a dream, and we’re building our dreams now.”“For example, the ministry of housing owns a building or many buildings in downtown Cairo,” he says. “I will give a new ministry building here, a smart and connected one, air-conditioned and up to date, and we at ACUD will take the old one. We are establishing a new company just to control all the buildings that we will receive from all the ministries.” The future of the many buildings that make up Egypt’s sprawling state infrastructure, mostly situated on prime real estate in central Cairo, remains uncertain. “We have no plan as to how to invest in these buildings, but we will fix it and figure it out,” says El-Husseiny. “Maybe we can make them into hotels.” Profits from these vacated buildings will then feed back into the ACUD. But it is also unclear just how much money is being sunk into the new administrative capital. It was given an initial estimated cost of £30bn in 2015.“There is no total budget,” says El-Husseiny. “It’s a big one, a great one, but we must also calculate the cost of building infrastructure.” He adds that the ACUD was founded with a cash injection of 204bn EGP (£8.5bn) from the ministry of defence and the ministry of housing, but emphasises that the project will continue without further government assistance.There are two kinds of budget, he says: “The budget according to the documents and the actual budget they have to pay.” He says the ACUD has already repaid 20bn EGP to the banks, although the source of these funds is unclear, as is who will ultimately pay for the rest of the sparkling buildings shown in the plans.El-Husseiny stresses the budget for the new capital will be settled on a “case by case basis” as each part is constructed. The governmental district, for example, will cost 40bn EGP. – By way of comparison, Egypt accepted a $12bn (£8.8bn) emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.The new capital will also draw on Cairo’s much-needed resources. Two water stations will pump an estimated 200,000 cubic metres of water per day, siphoning water from nearby satellite cities. Once the project is completed it will use an estimated 1.5m cubic metres of water per day. “In Brazil it was Rio and it became Brasília – we need this. It costs billions, we know, but we need it,” says El-Husseiny, referencing Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa’s landmark project to build a new capital in Brazil, now regarded as a symbol of the failure of urban planning and inequality. It is hoped Egypt’s new capital will house almost twice the population of Brasília, while paradoxically appealing to incomers as a way to escape Cairo’s crowded street life. There is no doubt that Cairo’s rapidly expanding population desperately needs housing. The number of inhabitants grew by half a million in 2017, making it the world’s fastest-growing city. Greater Cairo, now a megalopolis, housed 22.9 million people as of mid-2016 and is projected to contain 40 million by 2050. But the city is already ringed by a large collection of half-empty planned towns, each a failed monument to their developers’ inability to draw the bulk of the population away from downtown Cairo. Workers unable to afford to move to the new capital may be able to use the proposed electric train and monorail to get to work, but there are no guarantees that these will be competitively priced either. “In order for the new capital to succeed, if the goal is to reduce congestion, it doesn’t come simply by moving a few thousand employees,” says Elshahed. “Most government employees don’t own private cars, so it’s not like it’s them congesting downtown Cairo.”El-Husseiny, however, is determined that his vision alone will entice enough new residents, including foreign embassies and those working there. “We will give them benefits not available in the old Cairo, wide streets and a smart city,” he says, going on to outline something quite dystopian: “A smart city means a safe city, with cameras and sensors everywhere. There will be a command centre to control the entire city.” A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Cairo says that while the Egyptian government has located space for embassies, they are currently “assessing the move”. Other embassies contacted by  Cities were hesitant, but unwilling to discuss this publicly. “Cairo isn’t suitable for the Egyptian people,” says El-Husseiny. “There are traffic jams on every street, the infrastructure can’t support the population, and it’s very crowded. Without any specific masterplan, it has started to become ugly … there’s no humanity.”There is no doubt that Cairo’s congestion makes residents fantasise about escape, although wide streets, double-glazed windows, open water and pruned topiary seem more like the dreams of suburban London or Chicago than ideas well-adapted to the desert plain. But El-Husseiny is adamant. “We need a landmark, a new capital. We have the right to have a dream and this is our dream.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8188d2b44d0acafb099026da183ac730f53a88c9/0_317_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e186b545ca118da6c935ec859d63b9","title":"brexit deal mess leavers cheerleaders abandon","story":"At some point, we will need new words for “remainers” and “leavers”. They are legacy terms from a one-off campaign that will, on Brexit day, become obsolete. Does remain then become rejoin? Will leavers turn into stay-outers? Or perhaps the labels will outlive their original function. It happens. People who describe politics in terms of “left” and “right” aren’t talking about seating arrangements in the French national assembly at the end of the 18th century, although that is where the categories were born. I doubt that the Brexit brands will be so durable, or mutate so far, but they have come a long way already.Remainer is the more elastic of the two. It applies to full-throttle revanchists who campaign to dispose of Brexit altogether. But it is also used for soft-leavers in the cabinet who have signed up to Theresa May’s negotiating agenda, and that doesn’t involve much remaining at all.Beyond Westminster, there is a tenuous link between domestic Brexit tribes and the institutions commonly (and inaccurately) called “Brussels”. Some ideological Eurosceptics read the treaties before denouncing them, but they are a minority of leave voters. Most wanted rid of the European Union for less precise reasons.Remainers and leavers accuse each other of exaggerated passion – naively romantic or aggressively paranoid – for concepts that are only tangentially connected to the actual EU. Both are right. Britain’s membership of the club has become a proxy for culture wars fought on multiple fronts: immigration, globalisation, environmentalism, even penal policy. Attitudes to capital punishment and multiculturalism were a better predictor of people’s attitudes towards the EU in 2016 than whether they voted Labour or Tory in previous elections.A misalignment of party allegiance and territorial strongholds in the Brexit culture war is wreaking havoc\u0026nbspwith conventional political models. That, in part, was the story of last week’s local elections. It doesn’t matter to leave voters in, say, Amber Valley, that Jeremy Corbyn endorses the referendum outcome. His party hums with the socially liberal, metropolitan cultural vibrations of Brexit-bashing London. So Labour did fine in the capital and other big cities, but struggled to\u0026nbspcapture more provincial targets.Many of the Tory high priests of Brexit style themselves as liberals. Boris Johnson is much more relaxed about immigration than May. Michael\u0026nbspGove is waging a millennial-friendly war on discarded plastic. But a Govian eco-Brexit doesn’t impress remain voters in Richmond upon Thames, who see it as a green patina only recently formed on the roof of a church whose patron saint is Nigel Farage and whose guiding creeds are social conservatism and reactionary nostalgia.Many Tory leavers resent that characterisation. But if they didn’t want their image contaminated by bitter intolerance, they should have been more careful about the company they kept in the referendum campaign, and the racially tinted messages they borrowed. Besides, backbench Eurosceptic hardliners keep the flame of nationalist grievance roaring because it burns bridges to Europe so much more efficiently than their own rarefied arguments about regulatory ergence.Jacob Rees-Mogg would not have as much purchase on the current debate over customs regimes, for example, if it were framed as the quest for a technical solution to a problem raised by May’s commitment to a very hard version of Brexit (which it is). His voice is amplified by culture warrior megaphones, rallying leave partisans to defend the one true Brexit against treasonous counterfeits.That dynamic is hardwired into the whole project. There is a mismatch between leave culture, which thrives on heroic simplifications, and leaving in practice, which is a labyrinth of unheroic complications. The deeper into the maze May plunges, the harder it gets for those who campaigned with promises of a swift and easy escape to express sincere satisfaction with the final product. Many Tories will decide that any Brexit is better than none. They will murmur their assent to May’s deal and, once Britain has been bundled out of the EU, agitate for new leadership. They will not reject May’s Brexit, but nor will they rush to own it.That is because none of the advertised benefits of leaving the EU will materialise. Leavers will experience total victory in the political battle over EU membership, but without equivalent advances in the culture war. May’s deal will not accelerate reconciliation between a younger, liberal generation that feels its future has just been vandalised by its angry elders. And, over time, the brutal logic of human mortality favours the junior cohort. I don’t like the ugly, ghoulish habit that some remainers have of mapping a route to pro-European majorities through the graveyards of ageing leavers. Still, the underlying demographic observation is not entirely false.A less macabre observation in the same vein is that the historical trend is for British provinces to look and behave more like the big cities, not the reverse. In\u0026nbspterms\u0026nbspof social attitudes, where London goes, Nuneaton follows. And when politics is consumed by culture wars, that is bad news for the Tories, even if Brexit passes without economic calamity.The remainer tribe isn’t going to renounce its metropolitan mores just because the cause of remaining in the EU is lost. And the leaver tribe, upon leaving, will cling to grievances that were channelled against Brussels but not caused there. Neither side will cherish May’s messy deal and, because it will be unloved in the country, few MPs will have much incentive to defend it.There may be no shortage of will to deliver Britain out of the EU now, but in time there will be a great washing of hands and collective denial of responsibility for the deed. Brexit is the adopted child of a whole generation of politicians. It will be an orphan one day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/458574b7b4255bd5a42b973dd4bb0308c49ed8a8/0_0_6875_4124/master/6875.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=966701eb26617cf3476f2f2ae6d97bc4","title":"eea vote lords theresa may brexit suropean economic area post eu","story":"The House of Lords has so far responded in a robust, rational and highly effective manner to the government’s EU withdrawal bill. But the most important test of the peers’ resolve is yet to come. On Tuesday an amendment to the withdrawal bill will be tabled in the Lords that, if passed by the Commons, would commit the government to keeping the United Kingdom in the European Economic Area (EEA).The EEA is an internal market between the EU28 and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. It was established with the purpose of allowing the further participation of non-EU states in a single market (including services), but this excludes agricultural and fisheries sectors and the EU customs union. As article 1 of its founding treaty, the EEA agreement, states: “The aim of this agreement of association is to promote a continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the contracting parties with equal conditions of competition, and the respect of the same rules.”Article 1 is pivotal, because it unambiguously confirms that the EEA is a commercial association, not a political project. There is no mention of “ever closer union”, and no reference to the post-Maastricht pillars of the European project such as the common foreign and security policy or common security and defence policy. If the UK were to commit to an EEA-based Brexit we would essentially be returning to the original terms and premise of our pre-Maastricht membership of the European Community.\u0026nbspThe Brexiteers have of course been up in arms about the unelected peers attempting to thwart “the will of the people”. But their complaints are utterly lacking in credibility, given that David Davis, Liam Fox and Jacob Rees-Mogg have consistently voted against attempts to democratise our second chamber. And the fact is that the 52-48 result of the referendum was clearly not a mandate for a reckless Brexit at any cost, a point that was then further rammed home by the result of the general election. One message should be clear: yes, we must leave the European Union so that we can secure a greater degree of control over our borders, laws and money, but we must do so without wrecking the economy, and without burning bridges with our European partners and allies.Of course, the economy is not the Lords’ only consideration. It must consider how best we can protect the terms of the Good Friday agreement by ensuring that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland. The customs union amendment goes some way towards that aim, but it is not sufficient – it would not provide a framework for the harmonisation of regulations and product standards that is fundamental to frictionless trade across the Irish land border. Only membership of the EEA in conjunction with a customs union can secure that objective.And then there is the issue of time. We’re almost two years on from the referendum, and around six months from the meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement. And yet there is still a deeply entrenched impasse between the government and the EU around the fundamentals of our future trading relationship. The EEA is an off-the-shelf, ready-made package and well understood arrangement that has existed since 1993. By committing to an EEA-based Brexit the government would be providing business, consumers and our entire country with the certainty and stability that is so desperately needed.\u0026nbspOne of the arguments most frequently deployed against the EEA is that it would relegate the UK to the status of a “vassal state”. This is patently wrong. EEA countries are not subject to the supremacy of EU law. Any rules relating to the aspects of the single market that apply within the EEA internal market must be passed by the national parliaments of the EEA countries. And EEA countries are not subject to the direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice (ECJ). The EEA is overseen by the Efta court, and disputes are managed by the Efta Surveillance Authority. The Efta court routinely makes decisions and rulings that erge from the ECJ, and it would of course have at least one British judge, if we were to join – most observers agree that there would likely be two British judges.For those concerned about EU immigration, articles 112 and 113 of the EEA agreement offer the possibility of unilaterally suspending the operation of any one of the four freedoms – including the free movement of labour – subject to the presentation of a political case to the EU27 outlining the presence of “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. There is legal precedent for this through protocol 15 of the EEA agreement, which applies to Liechtenstein and would have been offered to the Swiss, if they had chosen to join the EEA.And Britain would only pay for what is accessed from the single market. This means it would not transgress the prime minister’s red lines on the single market or on ECJ jurisdiction, while offering veto power through the EEA joint committee, which determines whether EU laws and directives are relevant to the EEA andor whether adaptations are necessary. It would also give us access to expert working groups and agencies, alongside EU member states. This gives EEA governments multiple opportunities to shape and influence EU regulations and directives before they are approved. EEA governments do not have voting rights in any of these settings, but the vast majority of decisions in Brussels are taken by consensus in any case, and the views of EEA countries play an important part in the decision-making process.\u0026nbspOn 13 December 2017 Labour MPs were whipped to support my colleague Heidi Alexander’s amendment to the Withdrawal Bill, which would have secured an EEA-based Brexit. It is somewhat baffling then that Labour peers are apparently being whipped to abstain on this amendment. I hope that this is simply a misunderstanding, and that consistency and coherence will have returned by the time the ision bell rings.Because the fact is that the ision bell is also ringing for the Prime Minister. She cannot keep kicking the can down the road indefinitely. She must now decide which path to choose: will she follow the Brexit-at-any-cost diktats of the likes of Rees-Mogg, or will she opt for a Brexit that actually reflects the real concerns of the British people? On Tuesday, the Lords can play a vitally important role in ensuring that Theresa May chooses the right path. It is imperative that it does so.• Stephen Kinnock is Labour MP for Aberavon and a member of the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cce2a93f39c465563b519709fab70224de5a0bc/30_82_5068_3040/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc8e92979cabc97c694281869bd5d33","title":"met gala 2018 five things we learned from the red carpet","story":"Elon Musk has got together with musician Grimes, Rihanna rules and you don’t need a dress to make a statement Tech billionaire Elon Musk – who recently announced he wanted to start a candy company – and Canadian electropop artist Grimes – whose 2012 song Oblivion was ranked the best song of the decade – are a couple. The unlikely pair publicly announced their relationship on the red carpet on Monday night. Musk wore a white suit and Grimes (real name Claire Boucher) wore a necklace that looked a lot like the Tesla logo. According to the New York Posts’s Page Six, the pair have been together for a month, and first met when Musk messaged Boucher online to reference an AI joke she made three years ago. Two weeks ago, Musk tweeted that he was “just listening” to Boucher’s Spotify playlist Go Flex \u0026amp Psycho, in a flirtatious exchange that also included rapper Post Malone.“Glad ur finally listening to cyberpunk speedwae hahaha 🐇,” Boucher replied. “Sounds great riding my cyborg 🐉,” Musk said.

Boseman, the star of Marvel’s Black Panther, was one of the few to really jump aboard the theme, earning praise from (among others) Selma and A Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay.“There are very few things the Internet collectively agrees on,” wrote Time Magazine in 2017, “but Robyn Rihanna Fenty is the undisputed queen of the Met Gala”.It is of course not a competition, but Rihanna – dressed this year as a pearl-encrusted Pope, equal parts extravagant and intricate – delivered one of the night’s best outfits for the third consecutive year she’s attended (she skipped 2016). Apologies to rapper Cardi B, whose outfit earned almost as much on-the-night praise. Writer and actor Lena Waithe struck a blow for those maybe a little uneasy with the explicitly Catholic theme of this year’s event, turning up with a rainbow flag sewn into her blazer. “This is like my skin, I’m proud to be in it,” the Golden Globe-winner told the New York Times. “I’ve got the community on my back to make sure they know I’ve got them all the time ... The theme to me is ‘Be yourself’.

Most of the dishes here are simply on a par with nearby contenders, but it’s the takeaway shawarma – stuffed with beef or chicken, fries and garlic sauce – that make it a must for street-food seekers. Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates.

The Bonna Annee Special – preposterous value at just AED 40 (£8) – comprises a mix of meat and veg dishes, and will feed two people very handsomely indeed.Bord EauAbu Dhabi’s restaurant scene is full of wacky concepts. Thankfully, between the classic French cooking and the modestly stylish dining room, there are none to be found at this polished waterfront restaurant. That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation. Best of all, though, is the fact that even the simple stuff is beyond decadent – try the outrageously silken, buttery mash potato for evidence.shangri-laabudhabishangrilaHakkasanIt’s not unusual for glitzy restaurant brands to put down roots in the UAE.

If so, Abu Dhabi’s your placeThe United Arab Emirates has a reputation for the outlandish and the eccentric, and you’ll only need a few hours in its glitzy capital to see why. It’s hardly surprising, really: you can’t smush together centuries of Arabian tradition with oodles of international wealth – then use it to build one of the most ethnically erse, technologically ambitious cities on the planet – and expect the result to be run-of-the-mill. Looking for a break from the usual humdrum tourist itineraries? From high-speed camels to driverless cars, your hitlist starts here.Ride the world’s fastest roller coasterA veritable temple to the prancing horse, Ferrari World on Yas Island was the biggest indoor theme park on Earth when it opened in 2010. Its star attraction is Formula Rossa – a Formula One-themed ‘coaster that launches riders to a speed of 149mph in just four seconds, in the process inflicting the sort of G force that even Lewis Hamilton would describe as “a bit much”. Among other things, the park is also home to a fine-dining restaurant, which you’d do well to visit after your ride.Make tracks out to the desert for a camel raceAscot may have the upper hand when it comes to headwear, but for sheer dust-flinging excitement, a regular day at the races has nothing on the hump-backed alternative. This being Abu Dhabi, the regular meetings at Al Wathba – a short drive out of the city into the desert – are more high-tech, too, with robot jockeys taking the place of actual humans, who are relegated to riding alongside in SUVs and cheering like lunatics. Probably not how the Bedouin racers of yesteryear did it, but it’s a hell of a spectacle nonetheless.Hop aboard a driverless car in Masdar CitySomething a bit special is springing up out of the sand next to Abu Dhabi airport. Billing itself as a “greenprint” for how the sustainable cities of tomorrow will be built, Masdar City was envisaged as a 6 sq km (2.32 sq mile) district run entirely on renewable energy. This being the desert, most of the juice comes from solar power, which is used to run everything from street lights to the kitchens within the area’s growing stable of cafes and restaurants. Oh, and Masdar’s star attraction: the fleet of futuristic little driverless pods that zip visitors around the place like something out of a 90s sci-fi film.Admire the rainbow sheikh’s car collectionIt’s fair to say Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan is the petrolhead of the Emirati royal family. Set within a gleaming white pyramid just outside the city, the Emirates National Auto Museum houses the sheikh’s personal collection of cars, a fleet so vast and engine-revvingly macho it makes Jeremy Clarkson look like Jeremy Corbyn. Among the highlights are the world’s biggest pick-up truck (which has four bedrooms), a giant, driveable globe and a set of seven vintage Mercedes S-classes, one in each colour of the rainbow. Subtle? No. Spectacular? Oh yes.Clock a hot lap on an F1 trackWe’re sure the gym at your hotel is absolutely fine, but there’s a far more fun way to stay fit during your visit to Abu Dhabi. The Yas Marina Formula One race track welcomes walkers, runners, cyclists and rollerbladers on to its 5.5km (3.4 mile) grand prix circuit every Sunday and Tuesday evening (during the cooler months), and there’s even kit available to rent if you don’t fancy bringing your own. But no, sadly, they won’t let you spray rosewater from the podium if you set a new personal best.Strap on a water-powered jetpackIf you’ve ever fancied yourself as Iron-Man, flying around under your own steam, your luck is in. Thanks to the flyboard, a neat piece of kit that fires two high-pressure jets of water downwards, the wearer is able to float above the surface of the water. It’s simple enough even for watersport newbies to get to grips with in an hour-long lesson, and plenty of fun too.Experience the real Abu Dhabi.

There were no league tables, no Ofsted, no academies or free schools. Parent choice and competition had barely registered on the national consciousness.All that changed 30 years ago this summer with the introduction of the 1988 Education Reform Act, a huge piece of legislation that introduced the national curriculum and the idea of ersity and a “schools market” in which parents would vote with their feet, in theory encouraging the best schools to expand and the worst to improve or close.Three decades later, the tools of that market – performance measures and inspection reports – are a fact of life. “Go compare”-style websites ranking local schools are taken for granted. New education providers, in the form of academy trusts, are a reality in most communities.And Phillips’s school, Lilian Baylis Technology School, in Lambeth, south London, would appear to exemplify the benefits of this approach to public services.Situated in one of the most deprived parts of the country, it was propelled into the national headlines when the former cabinet minister and local parent Oliver Letwin proclaimed at a Tory party conference fringe meeting that he would rather beg on the streets than send his children to the school closest to where he lived.Today it is outstanding on every count, oversubscribed and achieving impressive results with a erse intake. The 1988 reforms played an unambiguous role in that improvement, says Phillips: “They shone a spotlight on schools failing young people like this one.”He is more guarded about the overall success of the market experiment: “I would give it six out of 10. More accountability provided a great opportunity for my generation of school leaders to prove ourselves and the national curriculum was right because it reduced inequality, even if it has been undermined by academy freedoms.“But performance measures (such as the new Progress 8) have now become impenetrable to most parents so may not even be helpful for exercising choice.“The school you go to still depends on where you live – we see parents swapping council houses to come here. Intake and its social class still influences how some parents make their choices and these subtle forces influence selection.”In the past six months I have been researching a new book, The Best For My Child. Did the schools market deliver?, which looks back at the 30 years since the passage of the 1988 act. The unease Phillips voices about the market reforms came through interviews with many of the key players in recent education reform.The English schools hierarchy is as powerful as ever, with some choices only available to a select group of parents who can afford hefty fees, move to the catchment of a successful school, or pay for costly private tuition to pass high-stakes entrance exams. Popular schools haven’t expanded to accommodate all comers, as pure market advocates predicted, and failing schools have proved hard to close down.The complex interaction between choice, admissions practices, house price and performance measures has led to segregation typified by schools with radically different profiles from their local communities.Some parts of the country, recently categorised in 12 new government-designated “opportunity areas”, appear stubbornly resistant to every policy initiative of the past 30 years.“The idea of applying the market to something that isn’t a market has bedevilled this policy from the start,” says Phillips. “A market is always going to have winners and losers. You can’t close down failing schools until they have completely collapsed their roll. What the sociologists call the ‘parentocracy’ doesn’t really exist in places where there are two rather than 20 local schools.”Meanwhile, there is growing concern about the unintended consequences of high-stakes accountability “off rolling” pupils less likely to succeed, teaching to the test, manipulation of the curriculum and small but significant number of “orphan schools” that none of the new “edu-providers” want.Several interviewees described a situation in which the government is attempting to oversee thousands of academies, through a muddle of local authorities, school chains, regional commissioners and the Education Funding Agency, as the “wild west”.Stories of poor financial management, even corrupt practices, in the independent state school sector persist. The antics at the Durand Academy, relieved of its funding agreement by the Department for Education, have been well documented and watched closely by neighbouring schools such as like LIlian Baylis. Last September the Wakefield City academies trust gave up all its schools. Recently the Bright Tribe academy trust has been in the news over transactions with companies linked to the trust’s founder.Phillips, who seriously considered academy conversion for his school but decided to stay within Lambeth local authority, believes the innovative instincts behind the early academies have evaporated in the rush for mass academisation. “The chains have over-expanded and it often becomes more about the preservation of the trust than about the pupils. In that situation, the children of the poor are most likely to suffer.”But perhaps the biggest weakness of the market has been the failure to guarantee enough good teachers – and challenging schools that struggle in performance measures often find it the hardest to recruit good teachers. “We have tripled the number of young people coming out of university with degrees but we haven’t increased substantially the number who are prepared to become teachers,” says Gary Phillips.“Young people want the kudos of entering a profession which is valued by their peers. There are too many bad case studies, often academy chains, being passed around and places where people don’t want to work.”Parent choice is here to stay, but the current lull in domestic policy could provide an opportunity for reflection on what has worked in the past 30 years and what could change in the future.Better local oversight of schools and stronger incentives for local collaboration, rather than national chains “cherry picking” little groups of schools, would be Phillips’ priorities. My own conclusions for what is needed now include reform of school admissions and a broader definition of what we mean by success, one that goes beyond simple test and exam results.Thirty years on we may be ready for another all-encompassing Education Reform Act. “But that would require great political leadership now,” says Gary Phillips. I agree with that.The Best For My Child.

The review will decide whether and how the current fees and loans system should be changed.The government abolished maintenance grants, designed to cover costs such as food, rent and books, from the 2016-17 academic year. They were replaced by loans – in addition to the £9,250 a year tuition fee loan – with students from the lowest income families able to borrow the most.Many argue that it is indefensible that students from the poorest families now leave university with the biggest debts – an average of £57,000 according to an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year. And the National Union of Students says that many working-class students still don’t have enough money to cover their daily needs, with many struggling to pay for food or heating.But experts also say the government is betraying students from middle-income families, by “refusing” to warn parents that they are expected to top up the loans for living costs. This can be as much as £4,500 a year for parents of students living outside London, and up to almost £5,000 a year for those in the capital.In its submission to the higher education funding review last week the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank attacked the government for failing to publish any information about these costs. Hepi’s director, Nick Hillman, said: “It’s a hidden nasty in the system. Most families don’t have £4,500 just lying around.”Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer website Moneysavingexpert, which has published its own breakdown of expected parental contributions, says it is “an absolute abomination” that the government is leaving parents in the dark.“If you aren’t entitled to a full maintenance loan, parents are expected to make up the gap, but what is outrageous is that the Student Loans Company tells you nothing at all about this,” he says. “It leads to friction in families and to students being underfunded.”Many families will just be trying to get to grips with university living costs as they apply for student finance – the deadline for which is this month. Rachel Wylie, from Wells in Somerset, whose daughter is hoping to start a textiles degree at Loughborough University in the autumn, says: “We’ve been to information evenings at school and they told us the government assumes you will top up the loan, but the Student Loans Company didn’t make that clear. If I hadn’t turned up I simply wouldn’t know.”Wylie, who works in health education, says: “We’ve had a university savings pot, but it isn’t enough money to cover everything, so we are definitely going to have to make some sacrifices.”She says that even if her daughter were entitled to the maximum loan for living costs it wouldn’t cover the full costs of living in halls of residence.Claire Callender, professor of higher education at Birkbeck, University of London, and at University College London’s Institute of Education, says: “I think one of the problems for the government is the politics behind telling parents – who are of course voters – exactly how much money they should contribute.”She adds that parents may resent the government telling them how much they have to put in from their own pockets – especially if they can’t afford it.A report on poverty among working-class students by the National Union of Students last month found the new maintenance loans “routinely” fell short of funding average student living costs, with many students unable to pay for enough food or heating.Ruth Wilkinson, president of Kent University Students Union, says: “I know students who are living hand to mouth. They are working as hard as they can in paid jobs in addition to their studies, and every spare penny after paying for their accommodation goes on food.”She adds: “We end up talking to some of the students who are really struggling because they turn up to our events knowing there will be free food. They aren’t paying for heating in winter as that’s a luxury. They are living in damp, mouldy flats trying to study.”The NUS says that the cost of renting a room in student halls has soared in recent years, and now typically exceeds what is affordable with the government maintenance loan. They are calling for universities to demonstrate that they provide some cheap accommodation for lower income students as part of the access and retention agreements they have to make with the government’s access regulator.The NUS and the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK have both called on the government to reinstate maintenance grants. Last week Hepi described the abolition of grants as “a big error”, and backed calls for them to be brought backYet the think tank noted that this could cost taxpayers in the region of £2 billion a year.But Lewis argues if there are limited funds this shouldn’t be the top priority. “If you want social equality you’ve got to face the fact that students haven’t got enough money to live on. The loans aren’t big enough. So I wouldn’t lower tuition fees, or bring back maintenance grants, I’d boost maintenance loans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ca83df70a4437839922a36439e22b801a4e8dc/0_244_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646ed41f7d3f9dcca07f7db8a9d764a6","title":"met gala 2018 pageantry and performance on the red carpet in pictures","story":"The 70th annual Met Ball was themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic ImaginationElon Musk is dating Grimes – plus four other things we learned at Met Gala 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f83ca7af2941fd4734126958e364ee60b6b69099/195_534_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eda6c22fa20213f8c4a7c96a4120076","title":"cannes 2018 top 10 film festival","story":"Asghar Farhadi goes Spanish, Spike Lee delivers a biopic of the black police officer who infiltrated the KKK – and Lars von Trier returnsA passionate, mysterious love story in postwar Poland between a musician and a young singer recruited as part of a communist-approved folk music troupe.Debra Granik, who directed Winter’s Bone, comes to Directors’ Fortnight with this fascinating, subtle wilderness story of a man (Ben Foster) who takes his 13-year-old daughter to live with him in secret in a public park.A Spanish-language thriller from the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi.

We may not all ride our bikes together and hang out in our tree houses, but one thing young people still share is the deep bonds of childhood friendship – and how much this contributes to the adult you grow into. But just as importantly, the film shows how temporary those bonds are. By the end the boys have grown up and grown apart. I wonder, even if they had access to social media, would that bond have stayed strong? This was the movie that prepared me for the reality of what my social life was going to be when I grew up. Callum Brown, 23, AberdeenIt’s brutally honest and yet retains an element of romanticism in a nostalgic way. What I particularly love, and what made it so relatable, was how Lady Bird carries a little part of every teenage girl, whatever demographic, lifestyle or ideology. Her close, respectful view of her mother, despite the clashes, felt really real for me, and she can still be rebellious in other ways. Also, it places a value on female relationships and the way that the “first love” boyfriends are so irrelevant in the end, but still contribute to her development as a person. Livvy, 18, FolkestoneSo many 80s movies were very much a boy’s perspective of growing up, as they were pretty much all made by male film makers. This is one of the first films I remember seeing that tells things from a female perspective and was so relatable to me and many other women for that. It wasn’t perfect (although Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf were!) but the eye of the film maker being female was notable, especially in the way the mother-daughter bond was shown. cate5365“Where were you in ‘62?” was its tagline. It’s got it all: great cars, a great soundtrack (pre-dating Tarantino’s style of mixing cool music to mood) and some slapstick moments. But most of all, the lead characters grow up and learn much about themselves over one hectic, hot night in southern California. It was shot in 1973, in and around Petaluma, based very much on director George Lucas’ teenage experiences with cars and girls (he’s said he identifies most with the nerdish Terry ‘The Toad’ character). A standout scene is at the end, when Kurt (Richard Dreyfuss) looks down from the plane that’s taking him to college and the next era of his life, and spots the white ‘56 T’bird he’s been stalking all night. Paul Hardiman, 54, OxfordshireWhile other coming of age films tend to stick with the stereotypical high school characters (the “queen bitch”, the dumb creepy jock, the weedy nerd, the ugly duckling who becomes a beautiful swan – even if ironically) this is the only one that (to me) successfully breaks these down to give all its lead characters depth, and a backstory. I watched it during my first year of exams, and felt impacted by the material as it presented characters I could relate to (especially Anthony Michael Hall’s character, who was struggling with academic pressure from his parents). It also presented a different view from other films, breaking down social-barriers and showing empathy crossing the social hierarchy of school, which I felt was actually very realistic. Ben Ramsay, 16, DundeeI revisited The Breakfast Club at a retro screening recently and I have to say it takes the cake for me. It’s basically a dialogue piece between five teenagers in one room but still holds attention. Judd Nelson was the charisma that held the film together and his anger and fear blaze throughout. But Emilio Estevez and Molly Ringwald get their turns as these self absorbed kids come to the realisation that they all have pressures and fears that they can relate to. I acknowledge some of the film is no longer acceptable to modern audiences, but let’s not pretend kids didn’t think, talk and act this way. mathalvorsonMe and my 16-year-old daughter laugh out loud at the school insights behind Mean Girls. Our other (perhaps a little odd) favourite is The Craft, which although based on the girls developing magical powers, shows how friendship can change, how your own desires (for love, for money, for beauty) can damage others, and how some friends are not always your friends. Great ending too.The other one we’ve watched a few times is Legally Blonde. I asked my daughter why she liked it so much and she said it’s because the women all back each other up at the end. We also like that the girl turns out (a lot) cleverer than the men in the film, and the message that you shouldn’t ever judge a person’s intelligence on their looks. JacquelIt’s often assumed that the coming of age genre is unique to or owned by the US – but what about the British film, If....? How many of the things mentioned in many of the films in this series (for example proms, with or without buckets of blood) are actually experienced in the UK? Granted, this is hardly a naturalistic depiction of British school life generally, or boarding school in particular (though some “inspired” pupils at a boarding school did stage an occupation and rooftop protest at the time). There’s a difficult school shooting scene that was recognised as such before these types of events became commonplace in the real world, and at least one critic at the time did refer to the ending as “fascistic”. But why must it be assumed that the right way to come of age is through the American rite of passage of the prom etc? comebackcpscottThis is a Belgian film about working class reality, not romanticised Hollywood trash about the angst of poor little middle class waifs.It won at Cannes, and David Cronenberg cast his legend in marble by heading the jury that gave it its laurel. Grinding poverty, an alienated teenage girl, struggle, the search for dignity, the dream of something better, the fingernail grip on the cusp of the abyss. And then, gradually, light appears – redemption is possible, there is hope and in a triumphant ending there is the promise of happiness. It seems like nobody in the UK but me saw it, but it enriched my life like all great art does.

Scott McGleish remembers his with perfect clarity. It was early in the season and his Wealdstone side had just won 3-0 at Hampton \u0026amp Richmond, a victory to which he contributed little. “Nothing at all went right. I had a bad game, missed a couple of easy chances, I just didn’t feel happy with my performance,” he says. “I walked into the dressing room and I literally picked my boots up and put them on the peg. And the boys went: ‘What are you doing?’ And I went: ‘That is officially what you call hanging your boots up. That’s me, I’m done.’”It was August 2013 and McGleish was 39, four years beyond the average retirement age for a footballer. But this was not to be the end indeed, McGleish ended that season with 23 goals as Wealdstone were promoted to the Conference South as champions. “The manager, Gordon Bartlett, got hold of me straight away and he says: ‘Don’t be silly. You enjoy it too much. We can see it on your face.’ I got talked out of it,” he says. “That particular day, that particular week, I had a massive moment. But from that lightbulb moment, thinking I had to give it up, I was totally reinvigorated.”Nearly five years on he’s still going, currently as playercoach at Chesham United. In February McGleish played his 1,000th competitive game of senior first-team football, and at the age of 44 his playing career continues to take the occasional unexpected twist. Last month he made his 1,003rd senior appearance, notable because it was the first game he has started in goal.Against Gosport Borough the previous weekend Chesham’s first-choice goalkeeper, Hafed Al-Droubi, had been sent off with half an hour to play, and the bench full of diminutive forwards. “The gaffer turned round and looked at me,” McGleish remembers. “I said, ‘Do you want me to go in goal?’ He said: ‘Yeah.’” He kept a clean sheet in a 3-0 win, and when the league refused to give Chesham permission to sign a stand-in goalkeeper, the 5ft 9in veteran forward kept his place. This time Chesham lost 2-0 at Farnborough.“I had three saves to make in the whole game,” he says. “I made two – one they scored from the rebound – and I nearly stopped the third one. It was disappointing to lose but I can say that none of the goals were my responsibility. I don’t mind where I play. I’d prefer to be in goal than not play. I just like playing.”Before last week McGleish had only made one appearance in goal, off the bench in a distant friendly, but he was not completely new to the position. “At Northampton once a few of the lads were staying behind for extra training and the goalkeeper said he was tired and didn’t want to stick around,” he says. “So I said, ‘Give the gloves here.’ The goalkeeping coach at the time was Dave Watson, and after the session he said I had something about me. So one day a week for the next four weeks Dave did some extra training with me after normal training.” Thereafter he hung up his gloves and remained, at least until last week, very much a forward.McGleish made his professional debut at Orient in March 1995, during the first of four spells at Brisbane Road, and went on to tread a path around the lower-ision clubs of southern England. He played most games for Colchester, who let him leave on a free rather than risk handing a new deal to a player whose body could no longer be relied on. He was 30 and at the start of what he now considers his best years, which he instead spent with Northampton, Wycombe and Orient.McGleish must now combine his part-time playing commitments with working four days a week for the PFA, but remains utterly in thrall to the sport. “I just love playing football,” he says. “It’s just pure enjoyment for me. I started in non-league, playing for fun. I’ve managed to have an 18-year career as a professional, totally loved every second of it, and I’ve gone back to where I started, working and playing for fun. The wife keeps saying to me: ‘Any chance you’re going to give up?’ I think she’d like us to have Saturdays together, but I can’t see it happening any time soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d77df2a03f6520e2e713c77126d51685ab37b7/95_179_1568_940/master/1568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7126e869a75a5cc6db2346704d0a4eed","title":"world cup stunning moments 25 ronaldo france","story":"The French celebrated a historic home victory while the rest of the world wondered what had happened to the previously imperious Ronaldo as he sleepwalked through the finalAs the Brazilian national anthem floated around the Stade de France, the camera kept lingering on one man. His identity was not a surprise. Ronaldo, after all, was the greatest player in the world, O Fenomeno, the star of a Brazil team that was hoping to become the first to retain the World Cup on two separate occasions. Nothing unusual about that, you might think television prefers to focus on the talent and in 1998, no one was as ferociously talented as Ronaldo, whose supernatural mixture of power, pace and skill had made him the player every child in the playground wanted to be at the age of 21, the hopes and dreams of a nation rested on his shoulders.The assumption was that they were broad enough to handle the pressure – but this was not a normal evening, even by the manic standards of a World Cup final. Sixteen years on, the events of that Paris evening remain shrouded in mystery and intrigue, the murky circumstances that led to Ronaldo first being omitted from the Brazil team sheet and then reinstated some of the most bizarre – and, some insist, scandalous – the sport has seen. It is a depressing but still fascinating story of claim and counter-claim, of conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory, of rumours of self-interest and political manoeuvring, of angry denials and scattergun accusations and, above all, a story where pinning down the truth can feel like a troublingly elusive task.To this day, only a select group of people know what happened in the hours and minutes leading up to the final, what compelled Brazil’s coach, Mário Zagallo, to backtrack and name Ronaldo in his starting lineup. Given that it later transpired Ronaldo had suffered a seizure in his hotel room in the afternoon, was saved by his team-mates and had to be taken to hospital, this was hardly a case of a manager making a decision on tactical grounds. That was too tall a story to sell the widespread belief was something bigger was at play.What we know is that on 12 July 1998, Brazil were in the World Cup final against the hosts, France, and because they had Ronaldo they were the favourites. At 7.48pm local time, 72 minutes before kick-off, the first team sheet was printed and submitted to Fifa, whose delegate surely did a double take once he had scanned the piece of extremely important paper in his hands. “Yes, everything seems in order here. Taffarel Cafu, Júnior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos, Leonardo, Dunga (captain), César Sampaio, Rivaldo, Bebeto, Edmundo. Edmundo? Edmundo?! Wait a minute, where’s Ronaldo? Mr Zagallo, are you sure there’s no mistake?”There was no mistake. Zagallo was said to have made his decision at about 5pm, telling Edmundo that he was in the team and Ronaldo, Brazil’s top scorer with four goals, was on the bench. He subsequently informed the rest of the team and, in an attempt to motivate them and lift their spirits, he reminded them that he was part of the Brazil side that won the 1962 final without Pelé.A good try on his part but some of those players had earlier seen one of their team-mates, their talisman and an apparently healthy young man, convulsing on his bed.The list was the first one given to journalists, just after 8pm, and the unofficial reason given for Ronaldo’s absence was that he was suffering from an ankle injury he had picked up in the semi-final against Holland five days earlier. Cue bedlam. Cue chaos. Cue questions as journalists scrambled around the press box, tripping over each other as they tried to find out what was going on. On the BBC, John Motson was in a magnificent frenzy. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my career,” he whirred. “The scenes in the commentary box have been absolute mayhem and chaos.”Ronaldo’s omission had come out of the blue. Even though there had been allegations that his weight was higher than usual and there was also a hint of the knee problems that would afflict him later in his career, pain and stiffness caused by tendinitis restricting him throughout the tournament and requiring the use of painkillers to get him through matches, he had still been Brazil’s best player and he was expected both to start and dominate the final, even against a French side that contained some of the most formidable defenders in the world.It was impossible not to be overcome by a sense of disappointment – no Ronaldo, no party. “He didn’t come to France to compete with the players of his generation but to seek a place amongst the best of the two millennia – this one and the coming,” Jorge Valdano wrote the day before the match. “If Romário, his predecessor, was subtlety, Ronaldo is exuberance. If Romário’s habitat was the penalty area, Ronaldo’s home would need to measure half the size of the pitch. If Romário is the past, Ronaldo’s almost cybernetic play belongs to the future.” To put it into context, imagine the reaction if Argentina reach the final in Brazil this summer and Lionel Messi is not playing. Twitter would crash, Jim White’s head would explode and over on ITV, Roy Keane would be glaring at Adrian Chiles.Confusion reigned, and Brazil did not emerge for their warm-up, but rumours then started to circulate that a modified team sheet was on the way and Ronaldo was going to start after all. Sure enough, when it arrived at 8.18pm, a furious Edmundo was on the bench and Ronaldo was in the team. He had made quite the recovery in such a short space of time. Eyebrows were raised.Ronaldo was the last Brazil player out of the tunnel. The camera focused on him and continued to do so during the anthem, its attention erted away to something less important every so often but always returning to its primary target before long, training its glare on Ronaldo as if it was trying to bore a way into his soul, to reveal to the world what was going on behind that impressively impassive look on his face.For his part, Ronaldo’s poker face was giving nothing away. Or maybe he was in a daze. There was a hint of a smile, nothing more than that, and Ronaldo stayed still when the anthem finished. “Ronaldo,” ITV’s commentator, Brian Moore, said, “Well he’s come through that dramatic injury crisis.”With the viewing public and the media still in the dark about what had occurred behind the scenes, there was an assumption that Ronaldo’s presence would swing the final in Brazil’s favour. Yet they had been heavily criticised throughout the tournament, a consequence of Zagallo’s caution, their rickety offence and their reliance on Ronaldo, who was quiet during the group stage but explosive in the knockout rounds, scoring twice and hitting the woodwork twice in the 4-1 win over Chile in the second round, creating a goal for Rivaldo in the 3-2 win over Denmark in the quarter-final and scoring in the semi-final against Holland, who were defeated on penalties.Pelé felt Brazil were a collection of great iniduals rather than a great team, while Johan Cruyff went further. “I said at the start of the tournament that I did not like this Brazilian team and I still say that. It would be really bad for football if Brazil won with such poor play because this team is imitated throughout the world.”Writing on the morning of the match, Ruud Gullit said he was disappointed with Brazil and felt Holland had been the strongest side in the tournament until their elimination on penalties. But Brazil were mentally stronger than the Dutch and Zagallo was unrepentant about a gameplan that veered towards bus parking. “We couldn’t risk leaving any open spaces,” he said. “Otherwise we would have lost – easily.”But as stoutly as Brazil defended against Holland, the sorry facade came crumbling down against France. Inside a minute, a long ball from Lilian Thuram caught out Baiano and Stéphane Guivarc’h, he of apostrophe and Newcastle fame, ran through to hook a glorious chance over the bar. Minutes later, Zinedine Zidane nutmegged Aldair, releasing Guivarc’h, who fluffed his lines again. A Zidane free-kick from the left found Youri Djorkaeff unmarked and he headed high and wide. Brazil were all over the place and Zagallo was soon off his seat, arms outstretched, demanding more from his players. Yet they could not raise their tempo, the lack of a warm-up unsettling them, and the sloppiness of their passing was only matched by the paucity of their imagination and the sluggishness of their movement.And then there was the sleepwalking figure of Ronaldo, who barely touched the ball in the first half, was tracked and hassled everywhere by the persistent Frank Leboeuf, playing instead of the suspended Laurent Blanc, even when he dropped deep. On the few occasions that Ronaldo saw the ball, he was on the halfway line, had his back to goal and was slow to react, constantly allowing Leboeuf to step in front of him to win back possession for France.Barely 20 minutes had been played and it was already clear that all was not well for Ronaldo, although the ITV commentators were not yet aware of the full extent of the situation like the rest of us, they did not know about the fit. “If it was anyone else, he wouldn’t play but he is so vital and inspiring,” Kevin Keegan observed. “At the moment, it’s a gamble that hasn’t quite come off. My feeling on ankles is they don’t get better, they get worse the more you play. Look, again, on his heels there.” Moore agreed with his co-commentator. “The one thing he has is electric pace and you need strong ankles for that,” he said. Ronaldo lost another battle with Leboeuf and Keegan said: “He doesn’t look in any way up for it.”There were only fleeting glimpses of Ronaldo’s coruscating speed. Midway through the first half he burst past Thuram on the left and although he sliced his cross, France’s goalkeeper, Fabien Barthez, almost flapped it over the line. Then, shortly after Zidane had headed France into the lead from Emmanuel Petit’s 27th-minute corner, Dunga knocked a straight ball over the France defence for Ronaldo to chase but out came Barthez, taking out ball and striker in one go. Ronaldo lying prone on the ground was the last thing Brazil wanted to see but he got up after a while.France, meanwhile, were enjoying themselves and after Petit, Djorkaeff and Guivarc’h wasted further opportunities, Zidane headed in his second just before half-time. Again Brazil had been found wanting at a corner, this time from Djorkaeff’s delivery. Zidane, who had been in disgrace after his foolish red card against Saudi Arabia in the group stage, had finally arrived on the big stage after disappointing in successive Champions League final defeats for Juventus against Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid. “I’m not very good with my head,” he Trevor Brooking-ed.That much was evident when he lost his cool against the Saudis and France laboured without him against Paraguay in the second round, but he returned against Italy in the quarter-finals and then played in the Thuram-inspired victory over Croatia in the semi-finals. “Zidane, Zidane, Zidane … France was in the grip of ‘zizoumania’,” Marcel Desailly wrote in his autobiography. “I never imagined it could grow to such proportions. Sometimes I asked myself if one human could withstand such passion. And did he, in any case, quite resist it? At the start of the tournament we found him a little febrile, more stretched, more demanding than usual, at least on the pitch. That febrility culminated in his expulsion against Saudi Arabia. And after a moment of depression, he reacted like a champion and started to prepare himself for the quarter-final.”Desailly’s comments offer an insight into the suffocating pressure placed on the most gifted players during major tournaments and even after that torrid first half, Zagallo did not remove Ronaldo, whose one sight of goal resulted in him firing straight at Barthez after 55 minutes. Roberto Carlos, his closest friend in the squad, wondered whether it was too much for him and said that Ronaldo had been “in tears in the night and in the afternoon he went yellower than our shirts”.Although Desailly was sent off for a second booking and, belatedly, Brazil stirred into life as the match wore on – with Ronaldo lasting the 90 minutes and Edmundo introduced with 15 minutes to go – they were caught on the break towards the end, Patrick Vieira setting up Petit for France’s third. Brazil had been comprehensively beaten. France were the world champions.While France celebrated their first World Cup, an inquest into Brazil’s non-performance was beginning to rumble. The spotlight was thrust upon Zagallo and he admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically. “For the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off,” he said. But Zagallo became angry when probed further about Ronaldo’s condition and eventually stormed out of the room, shouting “I have my dignity.” All was not well.So why didn’t Zagallo remove Ronaldo? First, he said, he did not fancy dealing with the outcry if he had substituted him. Yet conspiracy theories also abounded, the most prominent of which was that Nike had pressurised Brazil into playing Ronaldo. Two and two were added together and it was alleged that Nike used its £105m sponsorship deal with the CBF, the Brazilian football federation, to push for the inclusion of the most marketable player. “Here was a 21-year-old player, the best player in the world, surrounded by contracts and pressure,” Roberto Carlos said. “It was as if this was always going to happen to him. Something had to give. And when it did, it happened to be the day of the World Cup final.”For many in Brazil, pointing the finger of blame at a major corporation made sense and gave a voice to fears that money was ruining the people’s game. As the protests in Brazil against Fifa and this year’s World Cup have demonstrated, that feeling has not gone away. However, Nike swiftly and strongly denied allegations that it had exerted any influence over Ronaldo and was never proven to have done anything untoward.Slowly but surely, though, details began to seep out and it became clear that the supposed ankle injury was a cover story. “It was as if a malaise had come over him,” Roberto Carlos said. “Not even he knew what was going on.”The team doctor, Lídio Toledo, spoke to the media and said: “He was not feeling well this afternoon and now he’s better. What happened to him? Quite simply, he felt faint and after that he went to rest. I stress that he is feeling better now.”Perhaps he was but soon the Brazilian newspaper O Globo was reporting that the decision had been taken out of the hands of Zagallo and Toledo by Ricardo Teixeira, the head of the CBF and the son-in-law of João Havelange, the outgoing president of Fifa.The paper claimed Teixeira was told that Ronaldo had to play and also that the player had said he was ready. The only statement Ronaldo made was to tell Globo television a few weeks later that he was not a coward. He has since maintained that he was fit. At a low-key reception to welcome home the squad, he recalled the moment his world fell apart. “I don’t remember properly but I went to sleep and then, like the doctor said, it seems I had a seizure for 30 or 40 seconds,” Ronaldo said. “I woke up and then my whole body was in pain. But with time the pain got less and I relaxed a bit.”Brazilians were unsatisfied. Zagallo lost his job. Coaches followed him out the door, doctors too, and an inquest was launched in Brazil’s national congress. There it emerged that the squad had lunch before the final, before returning to their rooms at the Château de Grande Romaine hotel at about 2pm, whereupon Ronaldo, who was with Roberto Carlos, began to have a fit, his body convulsing and his mouth frothing. When Roberto Carlos began screaming for help, Edmundo, who was in the next room, came in to find the shocking scene.“César Sampaio, the defender, was the first person to administer first aid,” Alex Bellos wrote in the  in 2002. “He got to Ronaldo before the doctors did and, with Edmundo holding him down, put his hand in Ronaldo’s mouth to unravel his tongue and prevent him swallowing it.” Ronaldo then fell asleep. People looked in on him every minutes but he did not wake up until tea, when Leonardo insisted that he should be told about what happened.Toledo and one of his colleagues, Dr Joaquim da Mata, examined Ronaldo and he was taken to the Lilas clinic in Paris at 5pm. One suggestion, made at a later date, was that Ronaldo had been given a valium to calm him down but the tests showed nothing and he was given the all-clear at 6.30pm, arriving at the stadium at 8.10pm and telling Zagallo that he wanted to play. So he played, apparently neither the manager nor the team doctors wishing to stand in his way. “Imagine if I stopped him playing and Brazil lost,” Toledo told the commission. “At that moment I’d have to go and live on the North Pole.”Zagallo also angrily denied he had been ordered to pick Ronaldo. “If there had been interference, I would have resigned,” he said. “I have never accepted interference as coach of any club or national team.”For all Zagallo’s protests, it was highly debatable whether Ronaldo was the best person to decide whether he was ready to play the biggest game of his life seven hours after having a convulsion. Professor Alex Caetano de Barros, employed by Internazionale, Ronaldo’s club, to examine the striker, said letting him play was “an absolute error, since the 24 hours after a convulsion are those when a recurrence is most likely”.Could the painkillers Ronaldo was taking have been behind his collapse? A month after the final, Da Mata spoke out. “Never, in all these years, have I seen before a player with a convulsion,” he said. “I see young Ronaldo that day and I’m thinking tragedy.” He said that he had prescribed a common painkiller after Ronaldo aggravated a knee injury early in the tournament and said it was taken orally rather than being administered via an injection, which would have been too dangerous. “The medicine we use is not so strong, to cause convulsion,” Da Mata concluded.Globo would also hear from an anonymous team official that Ronaldo was given an injection of a cortisone with anaesthetic on the morning of the final. It was later claimed in the Brazilian press that the drug had entered a vein accidentally.Whatever the truth, and there are many shades of grey here, Jogo Bonito has rarely looked so ugly. But there was to be a happy ending when, after four years of being tormented by knee injuries, Ronaldo grabbed his chance of World Cup redemption by scoring the goals that helped Brazil beat Germany in the final in 2002. Older, wiser and a little larger, O Fenomeno was back.• This article was amended to say that Zinedine Zidane played against Italy in the quarter-final"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df40e69cc0a8854a7caf7a85e1de34077d26ad8/54_113_664_398/master/664.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6594488b6e9be108ad96e28f327ac4d6","title":"afghanistan captain shabnam mobarez denmark refugee womens football","story":"Mobarez, a former refugee playing in Aalborg, coaches and spreads the word of the women’s game at a camp in DenmarkIn many countries women who play football have to battle against negative attitudes but in arguably one of the most oppressive nations for women, still engulfed in war, where the Taliban no longer rule but their legacy and presence run deep, football can be life or death. Even so, in Afghanistan, where being seen in public without a man is taboo, a group of women are rebelling through their love of the game.Shabnam Mobarez is the captain of the Afghanistan women’s team. An Afghan refugee who moved to Denmark with her family three years after her father had fled there to escape war, Mobarez has spent time in the country of her birth to find out more about the struggles of her team-mates. “I was in Afghanistan two months ago before our training camp in Jordan,” she says. “I went to see how hard it is for Afghan players, who live in Afghanistan, to get to training and just live like a regular player. The situation was very bad in my opinion, very sad. Going to practice is such a huge challenge because they face so many things on the way.“We were afraid some of our players wouldn’t show up after a bomb blast in the city and were super afraid. These are the things they have in the back of their minds every time they leave their homes. For me to live that, only for three weeks, was horrible. How are they doing this incredible job? That’s the passion they have for the game.”Having moved to Denmark aged six, Mobarez found playing football much easier but she still feared her parents’ views: “It’s funny because most footballers’ stories start like this. I started playing with boys from my block, on the street, then a Danish coach was walking by with her dog and said: ‘Hey, I have a club for you, come join.’“I was very afraid in the beginning – were my parents going to accept it? So I used to go to practices hiding it from my parents but once they were involved they were actually fully supportive.”Mobarez could have chosen to play for Denmark but a strong connection to her place of birth and a desire to be involved in change powered her decision. “We are trying to bring something positive to the country,” the 22-year-old says. “These women are so brave they inspire me to do better and, because I live in a safe country, to work harder for them.”Denmark reached the final of Euro 2017, losing 4-2 to the Netherlands, and have agreed a new four-year deal for improved pay and conditions for the national team. Mobarez, who plays in Aalborg, is proud to be playing in a much more forward-thinking country: “Denmark is one of the best countries for women footballers. They have a lot of attention for the girls right now with the Danish national team doing so well.”Handed the Afghanistan captaincy in 2016, Mobarez is keen to give refugee children in Denmark the experiences she has had. “I volunteer coach at a refugee camp,” she says. “I’m doing it to make changes. I used to be a refugee and I don’t want the kids to go with a bad experience being a refugee. They need to smile every day and feel safe.“For most of the girls it’s expected that, if you come from a Middle Eastern country, you have to behave ‘like a girl’. Me going in and telling them my story and how far I’ve got with my football, choosing football, I think that’s a brilliant image to put out there.“You see the girls’ eyes go big, they want to be like you. Being a role model is amazing. I think that football gives them confidence and a feeling that nothing can limit them, that they can do whatever they want. They shouldn’t be limited by the fact they are girls.”Afghanistan, unable to train as a full team at home, have met for training camps and games in places such as the US, Germany, Jordan and the Netherlands. The team, coached by the American Kelly Lindsey, who has not set foot in the country since taking over in 2016 because of safety concerns, have risen from 128 in the Fifa world rankings to 106. “Working with Kelly Lindsey is one of the greatest things and I can say on behalf of the entire team that we’re so grateful and blessed to have her with us,” Mobarez says. “She’s been the reason we’ve improved as a team and inidually. In my personal life I’ve become a better person and a better leader.“Even though she’s not Afghan, she feels strongly about Afghan women, she wants us to succeed and she’s working so hard behind the scenes of each training camp to develop us as iniduals and as a team. I can only imagine what it’s like for her. Every time we come to a training camp we don’t know if everyone will be able to show up – she has to deal with that.”• The Phil Neville effect is strong.

Leave it in its plastic bag surrounded by the cloudy siero (whey), at room temperature, until you are ready to eat it. Placed on a chilly shelf, mozzarella is like an inadequately dressed person on a cold day: it braces and seizes up, losing its soft, velvety texture and, like a cold tomato, doesn’t taste of much.Do put mozzarella in the fridge, however, if you are going to cook with it. The seizing-up and drying-out is exactly what you want for an aubergine parmigiana or baked pasta, the slightly drier slices or cubes not weeping liquid the way they would if the mozzarella was kingly fresh.Once upon a time, all mozzarella was di bufala, made from the milk of the buffalos that have grazed on the pastures of Campania – the southern region of which Naples is capital – since the ninth century. Buffalo milk has a higher fat content than cow’s, so produces creamier, more fragrant mozzarella, managing to be both sweet and decidedly savoury.Growing popularity and demand for mozzarella throughout Italy in the 19th century, and then the world, meant people began making it with cow’s milk, or with a mixture of milks, but there was little differentiation – every stretched cheese simply became “mozzarella”. Classification has helped, the protecting DOP means it must state origin and whether it is di bufala, a mix, or cow’s milk (which is rightly known as fior di latte and can be extremely good).If you live in Campania and have an abundance of mozzarella di bufala, you might well cook with it, but even in nearby Rome, I rarely do: mozzarella di bufala is a prize and to be eaten just so – possibly with tomato and basil an anchovy maybe. For cooking, mixed milk or fior di latte is fine: it, too, is best left in the fridge for a day or two to dry out a little.Today’s recipe is another from Oretta Zanini de Vita, a weekday dinner dish she calls gratin alla Sorrentina, coming from the Sorrento region of Campania. It is the simplest of the baked pasta family the butter and cheese sauce is created on the surface of al dente pasta in the pan, then tipped into a dish and baked. It is neither creamy nor gloopy, rather gently flavoured and crisp on top. Plainly good.Oretta is quite bossy – which I like – and says you shouldn’t add anything. Sometimes I listen, sometimes I don’t, adding more cheese, peas, hard-boiled egg (my Sicilian partner Vincenzo would add them to every baked pasta if he could), and a big spoonful of mascarpone.Boil 500g pasta in salted water – fusilli is ideal – until al dente, then drain. Put the pasta back in the hot, empty pan with 75g room-temperature butter, 400g small-diced mozzarella, 75g grated pecorino or parmesan, (or a mix of the two) and a few good grinds of black pepper, then stir over a low flame until the mozzarella is melting and pulling into strings. Now tip everything into a buttered ovenproof dish, sprinkle the top with another handful of grated pecorino and some breadcrumbs, then dot generously with butter.To finish, bake the pasta at 180C350Fgas 4 for 20 minutes, turning on the grill for the last five minutes so the top browns. This is a gentle dish, so it needs contrast: serve alongside a crisp, green salad with a sharp vinegar dressing, maybe, and a cold bottle of wine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8875b37c7868bcb0e835bb5c3c27b0cc1d232c01/0_202_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f58b2b8450bbbc2b9e3ef24010d11bc","title":"pool basement wealth super rich digging down london","story":"In London’s richest boroughs vast subterranean enclaves are being carved out over several floors to house cars, wine, saunas and private nightclubs. How did underground living – once associated with poverty and disease – become an investment scheme for the uber-wealthy?With its eclectic fusion of Regency and mythological motifs, Havona House stands out amid the stucco-fronted Victorian townhouses in Notting Hill’s Pembridge Villas. The newly built mansion’s mock neoclassical columns and the limestone carvings of Greek deities on the facade reflect the roots of its owner, property investor Costas Diamantopoulos. Stepping inside the 8,600 sq ft (800 sq m) property, which is on the market for £25m, you are confronted by an array of opulent features, including a free-floating stone staircase, hand-blown glass pendants and marble en-suite bathrooms.If your neighbourhood has been affected by basement developments, or you own one or have been involved in their construction, and have experienced any of the issues in this story or similar, we would like to hear from you.

On its first floor is an underground garage, in which up to three cars can be parked via robotic platforms. On the lower floor is a 70ft swimming pool, which is filled by a waterfall that cascades over mirrored panels, with a cinema screen to the left. Mango onyx marble panels line the right-hand wall, with a Turkish bath, sauna, shower and a gym further on the other side. At the far end is a £30,000 plaster sculpture of four dancing figures, based on a painting by Poussin. The artwork also hints at the room’s special feature: at the push of a button, hidden hydraulic legs raise the ceramic-tiled floor to transform the space into a dancefloor. “In four to five minutes you can go from having a pool to a huge area of entertainment,” says Diamantopoulos.This is the second basement development Diamantopoulos has built in London in 10 years. He oversaw a much smaller one in 2008 under his former home in Cheyne Place, opposite the Chelsea Physic Garden, although it, too, has a pool, cinema screen, gym and sauna. This property is also for sale, for a comparatively modest £12m, under the terms of Diamantopoulos’s orce settlement. But he says his family regularly congregated in the basement when it was their main residence. He would swim in the oval blue-tiled pool, inspired by his childhood memories of the Greek islands, making use of the wave machine, or relax in the sauna, while his older daughter and her friends would use the gym. “If someone has the space and the ability, I would always recommend a basement,” he says.As decadent as they may seem, the features of Diamantopoulos’s basements are typical of many of those built under central London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in the past decade, according to a new study by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit. The report, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, found at least 4,650 basements were granted planning permission in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth between 2008 and 2017. According to their planning applications, these schemes boast at least 376 swimming pools, 456 cinemas, 996 gyms, 381 wine stores and cellars, 340 games and recreation rooms, 241 saunas or steam rooms, 115 staff quarters, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, 65 garages, 40 libraries, two gun stores, a car museum, a banquet hall and an artificial beach.The vast amount of extra space built under prime London properties contrasts starkly with the shrinking size of newly built homes bought by average families. For example, living rooms are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, falling from 268 sq ft in the 1970s to 184 sq ft in a house built since 2010, according to another recent study. Burrows says: “One cannot but be struck by how the amount of living space different households have available to them differs now. In our research we have come across some basement developments in central London where just the pool, gym and cinema combined are larger than the newbuild rabbit-hutch homes that many people have to put up with.”Nowhere is this more evident than in Kensington and Chelsea, the capital’s richest borough, which has about 4,900 UHNWIs, and has the highest number of large and mega-basements, often two or more storeys deep and extended under the garden. Beth Holroyd, co-author of the study, says variations in the scale and sumptuousness of basements reveal the wealth gap between London’s merely rich, such as corporate lawyers and accountants, and the global super-rich, including bankers and oligarchs. Holroyd says: “There is a clear pattern of association between the level of neighbourhood affluence and both the size and extravagance of the basements. The pool is a clear marker of wealth.”On Tregunter Road, in the Boltons conservation area of Chelsea renowned for its Italianate Victorian housing, the researchers found 22 approved basements, with features including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Five of these basements are standard-sized, 11 are classified as large and six as mega. One of the mega-basements, with a pool, gym and car lift, is in an 8,000 sq ft townhouse on the market for £26m. Four of the basements are currently under construction. Outside one, a huge red crane lowers building materials into the rear garden, under which, planning documents suggest, a two-storey basement with a pool, cinema, gym, wine store, steam room, salon and staff room is being created. Another two-storey basement with almost identical features is being excavated under a house across the street.“I can see that from my garden,” says local resident Shirley, who lives round the corner on the Boltons, gesturing at the crane with her walking stick. “We’ve had something like that or worse going on for years. We’ve had incredible noise and vibrations. I’m sure there have been momentary gaps. Our feeling is it’s too extreme. Very wealthy people buy them hoping to get the price rise and do them up and sell them and the next person does the same. Only a few of them are here all the time.”Alistair Langhorne and Claire Bunten, directors of LAB Architects, have been designing basements in the Boltons conservation area since 2008. On a tour of the area, Langhorne says that even here most of their clients want a basement to enhance their family life, rather than for property speculation – although Bunten admits that the budgets for some schemes were “otherworldly”. “They’ve all probably got homes elsewhere in the world but this is their main residence,” adds Langhorne.The basement boom began in the late 1990s in Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth, according to architects and developers, with middle-class families renovating their Victorian coal cellars. Excavations became more substantial as planning constraints made building above ground in central London extremely difficult, while, from 2010 onwards, stamp duty rises on property purchases over £1m made the costs of moving prohibitive, forcing owners to expand downwards. Only 23 of the basements the Newcastle researchers identified in these boroughs have pools – compared with 224 in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea – and the vast majority are standard-sized – one storey under the footprint of the house.But Burrows believes that mega-basements will continue. “There will always be a few uber-wealthy types who seem immune to the vicissitudes of the economy, politics and local planning policies,” he says. “They always seem to find ways of getting around restrictions to build their luxury pools, galleries, cinemas or virtual reality golf courses. There may be fewer of those really massive basements now, but the trend is not finished yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c17a9248b254e05d786fb2779e8042a8a1404ab3/0_168_2196_1318/master/2196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af871f43194505ed743b7075c9cc631c","title":"jay z and eminem claim weinstein company owes them more than 800000","story":"In court filings, the rappers claim they were underpaid for projects including the Jake Gyllenhaal movie Southpaw and a forthcoming Trayvon Martin TV documentaryRappers Jay-Z and Eminem have claimed the Weinstein Company owes them hundreds of thousands of dollars, in a lawsuit that is currently preventing the sale of the company in the wake of its bankruptcy.The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in March, following its collapse after the series of sexual assault allegations made against its founder Harvey Weinstein. Jay-Z claims he is owed $480,000 for two projects on which he is named executive producer – Time: The Kalief Browder Story, and the forthcoming Rest in Power: the Trayvon Martin Story – though the Weinstein Company disputes it owes money to him for the former.In a separate filing seen by Deadline, Eminem alleges the Weinstein Company owes him $352,000 for three songs he wrote for Southpaw, the boxing film starring Jake Gyllenhaal (who has also claimed the company owes him money).

By  Raj Patel and  Jason W MooreThe most telling symbol of the modern era isn’t the automobile or the smartphone. It’s the chicken nugget. Chicken is already the most popular meat in the US, and is projected to be the planet’s favourite flesh by 2020. Future civilisations will find traces of humankind’s 50 billion bird-a-year habit in the fossil record, a marker for what we now call the Anthropocene. And yet responsibility for the dramatic change in our consumption lies not so much in general human activity, but capitalism. Although we’re taught to understand it as an economic system, capitalism doesn’t just organise hierarchies of human work. Capitalism is what happens when power and money combine to turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. Indeed, the way we understand nature owes a great deal to capitalism.Every civilisation has had some rendering of the difference between “us” and “them”, but only under capitalism is there a boundary between “society” and “nature” – a violent and tightly policed border with deep roots in colonialism.First taking shape in the era of Chistopher Columbus, capitalism created a peculiar binary order. “Nature” became the antonym of “society” in the minds of philosophers, in the policies of European empires, and the calculations of global financial centres. “Nature” was a place of profit, a vast frontier of free gifts waiting to be accepted by conquerors and capitalists.This was a dangerous view of nature for all sorts of reasons, not least because it simultaneously degraded human and animal life of every kind. What we call “cheap nature” included not only forests and fields and streams, but also the vast majority of humankind. In the centuries between Columbus and the industrial revolution, enslaved and indentured Africans, Asians, indigenous peoples and virtually all women became part of “nature” – and treated cheaply as a result. When humans can be treated with such little care, it’s not surprising that other animals fare even worse under capitalism, especially the ones we end up paying to eat.Animals have been at the epicentre of five centuries of dietary transformation, which sharply accelerated after the second world war. The creation of the modern world depended on the movement of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens into the new world, reinforcing the murderous advance of microbes, soldiers and bankers after 1492. Capitalism’s “ecological hoofprint”, to use food scholar Tony Weis’s well-turned phrase, has become radically globalised ever since. In the half-century after 1961, Weis tells us, per capita meat and egg consumption has doubled, and the number of slaughtered animals leapt eightfold, from eight to 64 billion.To those with a romantic view of where their food comes from, uncooked meat appears to be a raw ingredient rather than a processed one. Quite the opposite. Feed and oilseed crops form part of what Weis terms “the industrial grain-oilseed-livestock complex”. Markets for grain made it possible for meat not just to become cheap food, but also to back financial instruments. Futures contracts in pork bellies, for instance, in turn require the uniformity, homogenisation and industrialisation of the crops they transform. Raw meat in the supermarket is, in other words, cooked up by a sophisticated and intensive arm of capitalism’s ecology.The environmental consequences of meat production are, of course, external to industrial agriculture’s bottom line. Nature is merely the pool from which animals are drawn and factory farmed, and the dump into which their, and our, waste disappears. The danger lies in believing the ision between nature and society is real, in seeing “factory farming” as an environmental question and “factory production” as a social question. Social questions are environmental questions, and vice versa.Chickens don’t turn into nuggets by themselves. Capitalists need cheap work. With the European invasion of the new world in 1492, that labour presented itself in the bodies of indigenous people. By the late 16th century, when Spaniards were desperately trying to revive silver production at the great silver mountain of Potosí, in present-day Bolivia, they began using the word naturales to refer to indigenous people. Through hard work and prayer, those indigenous people, and enslaved Africans, might find ine redemption through work and perhaps even, one day long in the future, entry into society as equals.Work was never meant to be fun. Consider the etymology of the French travail and the Spanish trabajo, each a translation of the English noun “work”: their Latin root is trepaliare, “to torture, to inflict suffering or agony.” But the way work works has changed.For millennia, most humans survived through more or less intimate relations with land and sea. Even those who didn’t were closely connected to the tasks and objects of labour. Human survival depended on holistic, not fragmented, knowledge: fishers, nomads, farmers, healers, cooks and many others experienced and practised their work in a way directly connected to the web of life. Farmers, for instance, had to know soils, weather patterns, seeds – in short, everything from planting to harvest. That didn’t mean work was pleasant – slaves were often treated brutally. Nor did it mean that the relations of work were equitable: guild masters exploited journeymen, lords exploited serfs, men exploited women, the old exploited the young. But work was premised on a holistic sense of production and a connection to wider worlds of life and community.In the 16th century, that began to shift. The enterprising Dutch or English farmer – and the Madeiran, then Brazilian, sugar planter – was increasingly connected to growing international markets for processed goods, and correspondingly more interested in the relationship between work time and the harvest. International markets pushed local transformations. Land in England was consolidated though enclosure, which concurrently “freed” a growing share of the rural population from the commons that they had tended, supported and survived on. These newly displaced peasants were free to find other work, and free to starve or face imprisonment if they failed.CAAIR’s recruits were predominantly young and white, but the majority of poultry workers are people of colour. Latinx immigrants are a vital force in US agriculture, and the delivery of their cheap work was made possible by class restructuring on two fronts. One, in the US, was a strong movement in the 1980s by newly aggressive meat-packing firms to destroy union power and replace unionised workers with low-wage immigrant labour. The other was the destabilisation of Mexico’s agrarian order after 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which resulted in flows of cheap immigrant labour – unemployed workers displaced by capitalism’s ecology from one side of the US border to the other.A line on a map between two states is a powerful abstraction, one that has been used recently by the far right to recruit and spread fear, and for much longer by capitalists in search of ever cheaper and more profitable workers. Under capitalism, national territories, locally owned land and new migrating workers are produced simultaneously.With migrant workers came elite fears of the itinerant poor. In 17th- and 18th-century England, this panic resulted in harsh laws against vagabondage, and the development of charities to ameliorate the worst effects of enforced destitution. Threats of imprisonment moved the poor into waged work, an activity that took the intelligence, strength and dexterity of humans and disciplined them to productive labour using another modern invention: a new way of measuring time.If the practice of labour shapes capitalism’s ecology, its indispensable machine is the mechanical clock. The clock – not money – emerged as the key technology for measuring the value of work. This distinction is crucial because it’s easy to think that working for wages is capitalism’s signature. It’s not: in 13th-century England only a third of the economically active population depended on wages for survival. That wages have become a decisive way of structuring life, space and nature owes everything to a new model of time.By the early 14th century, the new temporal model was shaping industrial activity. In textile-manufacturing towns like Ypres, in what is now Belgium, workers found themselves regulated not by the flow of activity or the seasons but by a new kind of time – abstract, linear, repetitive. In Ypres, that work time was measured by the town’s bells, which rang at the beginning and end of each work shift. By the 16th century, time was measured in steady ticks of minutes and seconds. This abstract time came to shape everything – work and play, sleep and waking, credit and money, agriculture and industry, even prayer. By the end of the 16th century, most of England’s parishes had mechanical clocks.Spain’s conquest of the Americas involved inculcating in their residents a new notion of time as well as of space. Wherever European empires penetrated, there appeared the image of the “lazy” native, ignorant of the imperatives of Christ and the clock. Policing time was central to capitalism’s ecology. As early as 1553, the Spanish crown began installing “at least one public clock” in its major colonial cities. Other civilisations had their own sophisticated temporal rules, but the new regimes of work displaced indigenous tempos and relationships with the natural world. The Mayan calendar is a complex hierarchy of times and readings from the heavens, offering a rich set of arrangements of humans within the universe. Spanish invaders respected it only to this extent: they synchronised their colonial assaults to sacred moments in the calendar.As social historian EP Thompson observes in his seminal study Time, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism, the governance of time follows a particular logic: “In mature capitalist society all time must be consumed, marketed, put to use it is offensive for the labour force merely to ‘pass the time’.” The connection of specific activities to larger productive goals didn’t allow for time theft, and the discipline of the clock was enforced by violence across the planet.Fights over the regulation of time continue even now. On US poultry lines, there is a federal law limiting the speed at which birds are processed: 140 birds per minute. The industry is lobbying to eliminate the limit, so that it can compete with factories in Brazil and Germany, where the rate is nearer 200 bpm. Worries about higher rates of food contamination and worker injury are being outweighed by the certain profit from more dead chickens.Capitalism has always experimented with every available kind of labour system simultaneously. A sugar plantation in 1630s Brazil, for example, would be easily recognisable as a modern industrial operation in, say, the Bangladeshi textile industry. Just as autoworkers on the line assemble simplified, interchangeable parts and fast-food workers manufacture standardised burgers, so did African slaves work specialised jobs in a simplified landscape of sugar monoculture.Behind the modern factory, there has always been a layer-cake of exploitation. Managers of factories were salaried more than the workers, who worked with raw materials acquired through various kinds of peonage and natural resource exploitation, and all of them depended on free domestic labour, usually from women. The global factory depends on a global mine, a global farm, and a global family.Hence the persistence today of slavery. One UN agency, the International Labour Organization, estimates there are 40 million people in slavery today, the majority of whom are women, many in forced marriages. Wartime work camps in, say, the Democratic Republic of the Congo supply the rare-earth metals such as tantalum that power the physical infrastructure behind the virtual economy.But just as management looks to find new ways to generate profit, so workers find ways to resist. Early capitalism’s great commodity frontiers – of sugar, silver, copper, iron, forest products, fishing and even cereal agriculture – were zones of experimentation in strategies of labour control in Europe and its colonies, and always spaces of conflict. Strikes, rebellions, negotiations and resistance characterised the application of capitalist work disciplines. Every resistance by labour was a new reason to bring in machines. Modern work regimes and technologies emerged from the crucible of experiments, strategies and resistances of early modern workers.Worker unrest in factories and slave rebellions, past and present, are linked not just because they are expressions of resistance, but because they are protests against the ecology of capitalism. Every global factory needs a global farm: industrial, technological and service enterprises rely on the extraction of work and cheap nature to thrive. The apps on your iPhone, designed in Cupertino, California, might have been coded by self-exploiting independent software engineers, and the phone itself assembled in draconian workplaces in China, and run on minerals extracted in inhumane conditions in the Congo. Modern manufacturing relies on layered, simultaneous and different regimes of work. And in response to every act of resistance against it, capitalism has moved the frontiers of work yet again.Hegemony over workers has been aided by cheap food, and the promise of a chicken in every pot. Cheap food has been central to the maintenance of order for millennia. But in the ecology of capitalism, that order has been maintained through planetary transformation.Since the 15th century, some land has become the exclusive domain of specific kinds of crops and crop systems: fields of monocultures designed to bring in flows of cash. Other areas were reserved to house those humans who had been excommunicated from those lands, to be better placed at the service of capitalists in cities. It was always a socially unstable geography, with low industrial wages supported by lower peasant wages supported by free gifts from nature, women and the colonies. After the revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries offered workers the promise of alternatives to exploitation, capitalist fears of urban uprising and communism reached fever pitch. To allay this existential dread, governments and foundations did not address inequality or exploitation. Instead, they funded the development of crops that would grow abundantly enough to provide cheap food and curb urban hunger.That it was urban, and not rural, hunger that troubled policy makers is vitally important. Food and employment for people in rural areas – where most of the world’s hunger was concentrated – were of little concern. Hunger began to matter politically only when the poor came to the cities and translated it into anger, and thence potentially into insurrection and a challenge to the rule of cheap nature. It’s here – in the bourgeois concern about that rule and its need for worker quiescence – that we find the origin of what came to be known as the Green Revolution.The aim was to breed varieties of cereals that might flow freely through urban areas. But the revolution wasn’t simply an agronomic transformation. It required more than magic seeds. In order for farmers to grow the crops, national governments had to subsidise the purchase of crops through agricultural marketing boards, to lay the infrastructure for irrigation, and to suppress political dissent around alternative food systems. The Green Revolution of the early- to mid-20th century was a package of reforms designed to prevent the revolutionary political goal of many peasants’ and landless workers’ movements: comprehensive land and agrarian reform.But the prodigious output did not reduce hunger. Wheat production in India soared, but the amount that Indians ate hardly improved. Hunger, particularly in an economy dependent on agriculture, doesn’t end if people remain poor: it doesn’t matter how much grain there is if you can’t afford to buy it. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon that from 1990 to 2015, prices of processed food rose far less than those of fresh fruits and vegetables, and that in almost every country today, the poorest part of the population can’t afford to eat five fresh fruits or vegetables a day.Although workers in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) saw an increase in their share of national income after the second world war, that reversed in the 1980s. This was a direct consequence of anti-labour policies that scholars aptly call “wage repression”. Given consistently low wages in the neoliberal era, it mak0es sense to look at cheap food as cheap not merely relative to wage costs but directly in terms of price. When we do, it emerges as no accident that one foodstuff whose price has fallen dramatically is chicken in Mexico – a direct consequence of Nafta, technology and the US soybean industry.Nafta originally excluded agricultural goods, but they were included at the insistence of the Mexican government, which wanted to “modernise” its peasantry by moving them from agriculture into urban circuits of industry. The strategy worked: Mexico’s campesino (“peasant farmer”) agricultural economy buckled, as evinced by the El Campo No Aguanta Más (“the countryside can’t take it anymore”) protests that spread throughout the country in 2003. Circuits of migration and pools of labour for US agriculture were the result. But at least the chicken was cheap.The imagery of the frontier lends itself to thinking only about land. But the past two centuries have witnessed a very different kind of frontier movement: the enclosure of the atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for greenhouse gas emissions. In the 21st century, agriculture and forestry (which includes land clearance for cash cropping) contribute between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions.This is inevitable, because they’re profoundly energy- intensive, and have become more so. That’s a big problem, because there are no more atmospheric commons to enclose, and no obvious way to keep the costs of climate change off capitalism’s ledgers. Nowhere is this clearer than in the faltering global farm, whose productivity growth has been slowing, just as it did for English farmers in the middle of the 18th century. Agro-biotechnology’s promise of a new agricultural revolution has so far been worse than empty – failing to deliver a new yield boom, creating superweeds and superbugs that can withstand glyphosate and other poisons, and sustaining the cheap food model that is driving the ongoing state shift in the world’s climate system.There is little reason to imagine that climate change won’t break the modern food system. Worse, industrial food production is a breeding ground for pandemic disease, and reasoned analysis suggests that the kind of concentrated animal-feeding operations that bring us cheap meat will also bring viruses that could decimate the human population. Again, this is nothing new. Just as early-modern climate change and the plague brought about the end of feudalism and the beginning of capitalism, so we face a future in which climate change and a vulnerability to big systemic shocks augur a dramatic end for capitalism’s ecology.We’re astute enough students of history to see that what follows capitalism might not be better. Around the world, fascism has emerged from liberalism’s soil. Yet precisely as capitalism’s bills come due, communities are both resisting and developing complex and systemic responses at capitalism’s frontiers. Around each of the seven cheap things that make capitalism possible – nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives – there are movements that are developing alternatives. Whether in a globally reviving labour movement, in the Movement for Black Lives’ demands around food, reparations and local economic sovereignty, or the feminismo campesino y popular (“popular peasant feminism”) developed by the La Via Campesina peasant movement in Latin America to bring together concerns around food, care, nature and work, movements are both fighting and developing intersectional alternatives.John Jordan, an activist and co-founder of the UK’s Reclaim the Streets movement, argues that resistance and alternatives are “the twin strands of the DNA of social change”. That change will need resources and space to develop. If we are made by capitalism’s ecology, then we can be remade only as we in turn practise new ways of producing and caring for one another together – a process of redoing, rethinking and reliving our most basic relations.Adapted from A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things by Raj Patel and Jason W Moore, published by Verso on 22 May, and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/578dd9495fdde449289f5c658a9afde3755a5406/0_179_1933_1160/master/1933.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02cead807f298c2fda11f1b0af39863f","title":"theresa may facing renewed turmoil over brexit options","story":"House of Lords, Irish government and unhappy Tories pile pressure on prime minister Theresa May is facing renewed cross-party pressure to accept membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) or risk defeat in the Commons.Peers vote on Tuesday night on a series of amendments as officials work to try to find a deal on May’s preferred option of a customs relationship with Europe that is acceptable to Brexiters and remainers in her cabinet, as well as MPs and EU negotiators.The policy paper rejected by the inner cabinet on the Brexit subcommittee last week has been withdrawn for further work and will not be discussed at this week’s regular meeting.A Downing Street source said: “It was agreed on Wednesday that more work needed to be done to flesh out the general principles agreed – no hard border and as frictionless trade as possible.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.The prime minister also came under pressure from Boris Johnson, who is currently in Washington trying to persuade Donald Trump to stick with the Iran nuclear deal. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the foreign secretary dismissed May’s customs partnership proposal as “crazy” and said it would create massive bureaucracy. The scheme involves the UK levying border tariffs on imports on behalf of the EU and refunding them where the imported goods stay in Britain. Johnson also condemned any system that prevented the UK from establishing its own trade policy and negotiating deals with non-EU countries, which is also the principle objection of Conservatives led by Jacob Rees-Mogg in the European Research Group.Meanwhile, the Irish government is concerned that many MPs and peers still believe that Dublin will back down at the last minute on the hard border.A source close to the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: “Westminster is mistaken if it thinks the Irish government will move. And it has no understanding of Leo Varadkar. He is someone who will do the right thing for Ireland. They think we’ll get to the last point of the negotiations – and the border will be the last thing – and we’ll move, and we won’t.” He insisted that the EU would defend Irish interests as fiercely as Dublin, but the Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, said the EU was being unrealistic, while Britain’s former ambassador to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer, accused the EU of putting the Good Friday agreement at stake by “weaponising” the border issue.Tuesday’s amendment to the withdrawal bill has been tabled by the Labour peer Waheed Alli in a move that is infuriating party managers.They say the Commons already has the chance to influence the detail of the final orce arrangements because of an earlier amendment and fear the extra vote could jeopardise a move to remove the time and date of Britain’s departure from the EU from the face of the bill, which has nearly completed its passage through the Lords.The vote brings the simmering tension in the Labour party over its stance on Brexit back into the open. Chuka Umunna, the Labour backbencher who jointly chairs a cross party pro-Europe group with the Tory MP Anna Soubry, says it is time for Labour to be clear about where it stands.“The party must pick sides,” he said. “To oppose the single market is to be aligned with Jacob Rees-Mogg.” In an article in the Independent, Umunna argues that it is impossible to meet the party’s six tests on the Brexit deal without membership of both the customs union and the single market.The new round in the increasingly bitter battle over Britain’s future relations with Europe was triggered by the business secretary setting out how devastating customs checks would be for major employers such as the car industry. Clark said: “It’s an area in which we are strong, we are growing, the world is looking to our industrial strategy to the innovations that we’re making there. So this requirement to do what it takes to get that frictionless – minimum of frictions, is something that we’ve made a public commitment to and we need to make sure that we get that right.”Clark warned that thousands of jobs would be at risk without frictionless trade and insisted the customs partnership was still under discussion. His intervention was taken as a bid licensed by Downing Street to revive a project that Brexiters outside cabinet believed they had forced off the agenda. Rees-Mogg immediately claimed “project fear” was being revived. On Monday, another leading Brexiter, Michael Gove, praised an intervention on Twitter from Open Europe’s director Henry Newman, who argued that the customs union issue had been comprehensively debated and rejected in the referendum. On the remainers’ side, the former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said some Brexiters were behaving like toddlers. Writing on Conservative Home, Morgan said they were wrong to believe a customs union was being proposed only as a way of avoiding Brexit altogether. She insisted the only question was how to leave andwarned that the local election results appeared to show a party losing more and more support among younger voters and those who had backed remain.It has also emerged that the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is in a stand-off with the chancellor, Philip Hammond – a leading remain voice in the cabinet – over his departmental budget. The chancellor is under pressure to find enough slack in the budget to ease the squeeze on public services. He is also one of the principle advocates of a Brexit deal that remains as close as possible to the EU in order to protect British industry and jobs. Fox’s department has a relatively small budget by Whitehall spending department standards. About £400m is spent on policy development, negotiators and overseas trade promotion.

But he insists he would not change a thing‘I’ve had a beautiful wee life,” Eamonn Magee says soon after he has opened the front door in his dressing gown and cracked open his first beer of the day just after 11 on a Monday morning. The former boxer, who knocked down Ricky Hatton in 2002 and was a world champion when he won the WBU welterweight title, is cut and bruised from being attacked the night before.Magee’s left hand is also swollen with an obviously broken finger making him wince whenever it brushes against his can of Carling. Such pain, however, is fleeting compared with the deeper hurt that runs through him in Ardoyne, the tough Republican enclave of Belfast, where Magee’s life has been scarred by violent sectarianism, tragedy and alcoholism.“I wouldn’t change a thing,” Magee says as he takes another slug of warm beer. His battered, 46‑year‑old face crinkles and the lump under his left eye looks even more like a purple mouse as he echoes: “I’ve still had a wee beautiful life.”Magee is in trouble again because he and the writer Paul Gibson have produced a raw and riveting book which opens like this: “A book? Listen, I’ve been beaten with baseball bats, I’ve had my throat slashed, I’ve been kidnapped and exiled out of the country. I’ve been shot twice, I’ve been in prison and my son’s just been stabbed to death. Amongst all that, I was the welterweight champion of the world while drinking the bar dry and doing enough coke to kill a small horse every night. My life’s not a book. It’s a fucking movie script.”The book has caused strife and he says he has been attacked on successive nights in Ardoyne. Exception has been taken to Magee detailing many horrendous incidents, stretching from Republican politics and sectarian violence to drink and drugs, and he shakes his head when I ask how he is feeling. “It’s more embarrassing when I’m fighting,” he says softly, licking his cracked lips. “Last night I was even talking to him while defending myself. I’m punching him and saying: ‘Fuck sake, what’s this about?’”Magee waves his bust hand at me. “Who do you think came out the better?”Will Magee return to the gym? “I’m busy this week but back next Monday,” he says, defiantly.Could someone really walk in and shoot him? “What’s keeping them?” Magee says with a dark chuckle. “It’s not as if they don’t know where I live.”I had felt calm when I took the call which told me about Magee’s latest scrap. My mood remained the same in the cab rumbling through the familiar streets of Belfast, passing the old Republican murals and the high Peace Walls which still separate Catholic and Protestant communities. I even felt OK when, after I rang the bell, two pit bulls next door leapt at the fence, barking fiercely. “They’re wee nippers,” their owner warned as he pulled the dogs away.Yet it’s hard to feel serene now. Each time Magee’s phone interrupts us, with its Who Let The Dogs Out? ringtone, I scan his beaten-up face, wondering if it’s a call to tell him a paramilitary gunman is on his way. I don’t feel too hopeful at the prospect of Magee, in his dressing gown, and I talking our way out of trouble.“Why the hell would you want to shoot me?” Magee asks. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”As a way of changing the subject I point to his beer. He has been drinking since he was nine and the book makes clear he is a high‑functioning alcoholic but does he ever wish he could kick the bottle?“I tried rehab,” he eventually says, pausing again with comic timing before breaking into the Amy Winehouse song. “And I said, ‘No, no, no!’”I can’t help laughing with him before Magee continues. “I really did go to rehab and the only thing that fucked me up was that you’re not allowed TV. Not having TV was worse than no drink. You’re better off doing six months in jail.”Beneath all his scars the internal wounds have not healed. Magee tells a chilling story of how, during internment raids in the 1970s, he and his three brothers would be turned out of the two beds they shared. British soldiers marched them downstairs and they had to kneel, hands behind their heads, while their photographs were taken for no apparent reason.“Oh fuck, where are we starting?” Magee says as he remembers the impact that internment, detention without trial, had on Catholic families in the Troubles. “My dad was a through‑and‑through Republican and had a proper understanding of what the war was about. It wasn’t about bothering Protestants. The war was against the British army in Ireland. But my dad was a smashing man. The Brits imprisoned him in Long Kesh and the Irish Republicans had a bus run because in them days people couldn’t afford anything else. So we would take the bus up to Long Kesh. I was a wee nuisance and carried in letters which we’d written on cigarette papers. I folded them and hid them under my tongue.”Magee opens his mouth to show me how he did it but, sitting in his dead father’s house, I’m upset by his memory of how, once his dad had fallen out with the IRA and been banished to England, he snuck back into Ardoyne and was hidden away in his attic. Magee, his mum, Isobel, and his brothers lived in fear of his dad being discovered. They hid him in the attic for 18 months – which contributed to Magee Sr’s acute depression and alcoholism.“I didn’t get over that,” Magee says. “My mum would have a wee drink and dad would sit in there all night. I’d go in and slip him a tin or a fag. Nobody ever knew he was there.”Later, when Magee had become one of the most accomplished amateur boxers in Ireland, his father saved his career. Magee had joined the IRA’s youth wing because he loved the mayhem of rioting but he also began taking and dealing drugs. An IRA punishment shooting usually entailed being shot in the kneecap or worse but his dad reminded the paramilitaries that Eamonn was fighting in the Irish championships.“If my dad hadn’t stepped in they were talking about me getting the six-pack – elbows, knees and ankle. But my father convinced them to only give me one bullet.”How did Magee feel waiting for the knock on the door before he took a bullet in his calf? He shrugs. “It had to be dealt with. I knew it was going to be a flesh wound so hurry the fuck up. When he took me down an alleyway I asked: ‘What it’s like getting shot?’ He said: ‘Like a hot poker going in your leg.’”Who Let The Dogs Out? thumps again on cue. Magee shuts down his phone and I say it’s incredible he still won the national title a few months later. “I won but there was blood streaming down my leg from the gunshot wound.”Magee is a hard and sometimes violent man but between the ropes he was a slick southpaw who boxed with artistry. “I never bullied anybody in my life, so you can rephrase that,” he says quietly when I mention his violent infamy. “I went to the gym because I’m the baby of four and my brothers all were boxers. After a couple of years I’d see wee openings. Bing, bang. Soon as I started learning how to hit him before he hits me it was a hell of a lot easier.”Magee’s best year in the ring was in 2002 when he knocked out Jon Thaxton, a very good pro, to secure a crack at Hatton’s WBU light-welterweight title. He still drank six beers every Saturday night while training. “It was a wee prize at the end of the week but I was well prepared for Thaxton. With the Hatton camp, life was a party.”He would drive around town late at night, visiting bars and clubs, with Magee v Hatton logos splashed across his Range Rover. Three senior IRA men paid him a visit. “I don’t know why they gave me another warning. I wasn’t doing anything wrong apart from drinking and driving – and that’s nothing to do with the IRA. They told me to concentrate on training and stop partying. The main guy shook my hand and said: ‘Best of luck when you fight Ricky.’”It clearly worked in the Hatton fight because, in round one, Magee knocked down his celebrated opponent. “It was the worst punch I ever threw because I landed it after 40 seconds. Bam! But he’s 10 years my junior so of course he’s getting up when still so fresh. I wish I’d landed that punch later.”Hatton sealed a close decision but Magee won the vacant WBU welterweight title by beating a journeyman in Jimmy Vincent in December 2003. He retained his world title until May 2006 but he only had two fights in that troubled time. Magee had fallen out with a respected figure in Republican circles and, in a gruesome attack in 2004, his left leg was clubbed to a pulp. He suffered a compound fracture of his tibia and fibia, a shattered knee, and a punctured lung. They called him the Miracle Man when he returned to the ring.Magee’s legs stick out of his dressing gown and the lumps and scars provide graphic proof of that terrible beating. “It still gives me pain,” he says, balancing a beer on his knee as he studies his left leg. “The doctor thought I’d never walk again but I was in the gym a year later.”I suggest we leave the house and go for a walk around Magee’s neighbourhood. Rather than waiting inside for a knock on the door, we will be less exposed to any stray visitors. Magee agrees but, first, we remember his son who was stabbed to death in May 2015 – by the jealous ex-husband of his girlfriend. Eamonn Jr was so different to him, studying engineering at university while also boxing, and the grief becomes too much. Magee starts to cry, a muffled ache falling from his mouth as tears roll down his face.I say how sorry I am and Magee squeezes my hand only to curse the pain in his broken finger, before wiping his eyes. We talk about his book and, of the title, he says: “The Lost Soul was beautiful. My mother called me a lost soul and she was right.”Magee goes upstairs to get dressed. When he returns, wearing a hat straight out of Peaky Blinders, he almost looks dapper. The old fighter sinks the dregs of his beer. We walk outside and Magee takes me on a tour of the murals. Afterwards he hugs me in the street, calling me a gentleman and a scholar, even if I can’t stay for a lunchtime drink. Magee lifts his broken hand in a stately wave as my taxi drives away. I check my recording in the back of the cab and Magee’s ghostly voice echoes again as we drive through Belfast: “I’ve seen things not many people have seen but if they hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be the man I am today. So I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m more than happy with my wee life.”The Lost Soul of Eamonn Magee by Paul Gibson is available at www.bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b839fd371e4c254948a71a0f8712332dfda05bba/112_78_2611_1566/master/2611.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1af8e30c6fa5abf02cf5c95afe333de","title":"the spin ed smith england contenders cricket test team","story":"Like the cuckoo the new chief selector has been spotted this spring. He has been migrating north and west (it’s the only way to go from where he lives) to soak up some county cricket, to chat to the coaches, the umpires and the odd senior player as he reacquaints himself with the domestic circuit.Ed Smith knows that the easiest time to make an impact as a selector, heralding a vibrant new regime, is at the start of a season. After that, as Harold Macmillan probably didn’t say, “stuff happens”. The borderline selection, whom you don’t really rate, scores a lucky century the one you really hold in high esteem bags a pair and the course is set. But for the first Test of a summer a selector is not so restricted. There is scope to trust one’s instincts.Andrew Strauss has pointed out that “Ed comes with fresh ideas”, which is clearly true. When I have sat alongside him in a commentary box interesting theories come to light as frequently as pigeons used to when Henry Blofeld was at the microphone. Upon announcing Smith as his chief selector Strauss added: ”There is real depth to his talent identification knowledge”. I will try to interpret as best I can. Strauss may have meant “he knows a good cricketer when he sees one” or he may have been hinting at a highly sophisticated, innovative scientificmathematicalpsychological system of assessing players who might excel for England. We’ll see.The impetus for some sort of change to the Test team is considerable. Throughout the winter England played seven Tests, losing five and drawing two. In these circumstances it would seem odd for a new selector – or an old one for that matter - to pick all the familiar names. However, it is not obvious which way Smith can go to invigorate the side.At the start of the season the data often seems skewed. In the first few rounds of this year’s Championship wickets have usually tumbled on damp, green pitches so that runs count double, while the value of a pile of wickets, mostly taken by 80mph seamers, can be halved. In the last round of matches on drier, sun-drenched surfaces the batsmen have started to enjoy themselves a bit. But have the right men prospered for Smith?With the Lord’s Test just over a fortnight away, there are, I think, only five absolute certainties assuming all are fit (Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson). You may have spotted a glaring absentee on this list, an opening batsman of unprecedented experience, and that is where we start.Openers: All the candidates are left-handed and I acknowledge that the senior one, Alastair Cook, is a very strong probable. But it is good to keep him guessing. Over the years the great players demonstrate a highly-tuned survival instinct. They manage to conjure something whenever their career is jeopardised. So it may be helpful to put Cook on notice (moreover in the winter in 15 Test innings he only managed to exceed 37 once - when he scored 244 not out in Melbourne). Mark Stoneman, by his own candid admission, has not done enough to nail down a place, though his last Test innings was a career-best 60. Rory Burns, his partner at Surrey, where batsmen tend to prosper, has scored some runs, while Keaton Jennings, after a poor start at Lancashire, has just hit a century at Old Trafford, where Haseeb Hameed has just been dropped. Another fancied left-hander, Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, posted a century at Hove.Middle order: In Christchurch it was James Vince, Root and Dawid Malan. Of these Vince is the most vulnerable despite scoring 76 in his last Test innings. One of Vince’s attractions is that he is used to batting at three, which Root is reluctant to do. But how he exasperates. Other contenders, such as Liam Livingstone of Lancashire and Dan Lawrence of Essex, rarely bat so high for their counties. Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke has just struck 157 batting at four at the powderpuff Oval after a poor start to the summer. We can now proceed more quickly.All-rounder: Barring accidents we fall back on Stokes with a caveat over whether he is capable of bowling 15 overs a day with a red ball. This spring he has not been able to take the IPL by storm.Wicketkeeper: More certainty – I think. There is Jonny Bairstow unless Smith suggests sending him up the order as a specialist batsman. However Bairstow is adamant that he should keep the gloves - and it was somehow uplifting to see him standing up at Chelmsford not only to Steve Patterson but also Ben Coad.Pace attack: Who joins Anderson and Broad? They tried Mark Wood in Christchurch instead of Chris Woakes with little success. Both have been languishing on the sidelines in the IPL in the last fortnight. Craig Overton has been doing his duty for Somerset but the fast ones tend to be off target or off games. Olly Stone of Warwickshire flickered when taking eight for 80 against Sussex but then injury concerns resurfaced. Jake Ball with 25 and Coad (23) are the leading wicket-takers in the first ision. The selectors may just hope that Woakes is rejuvenated by the presence of a devilish, dark Duke in his hand.Spinners: Until recently Moeen Ali has been hiding in India, Jack Leach in Taunton, though England’s latest Test player was in action for Somerset this week on an Old Trafford featherbed. He is an improving cricketer (he top-scored to save the game against Lancashire) and a competent left-arm spinner. Leach’s cause is helped considerably if Stokes is fit to bowl.

Despite an opening sequence in which old-fashioned school desks are transformed into sky-skating boats suspended high above the audience, the meaning of the title never reveals itself. Dramatic coherence has never been this company’s strong suit. And yet if you go with the flow it creates a seductive dreaminess around some first-class turns, including marvellous displays of diablo and unicycling, neither normally high on the wow-factor. The unicycling in particular is both absurd and full of drama as attempts to get dressed while cycling, or to ride over a line of upturned wine glasses, constantly wobble on the edge of failure. It’s great to see the clowning spring directly out of the skills themselves: flaming torches constantly set the juggler alight three men wage a ridiculous war on the Cyr wheel. A hand-balancing act set to haunting klezmer chords, is both funny and mournful.But it’s a pity that the show also looks to the past in the way the women are sidelined and showcased: twirling in the air on a giant mobile, their skirts rising like Marilyn Monroe’s, or doing traditional skills such as manipulation.

It’s not just a game – it affects us financially, physically and emotionally.”The pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling mechanism on our news feeds are unnervingly similar to a slot machine, said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google who has been described as the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience.“You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing,” Harris wrote.We cannot know when we will be rewarded, and more often than not we don’t find anything interesting or gratifying, much like gambling. But that’s precisely what keeps us coming back.“The rewards are what psychologists refer to as variable reinforcement schedules and is the key to social media users repeatedly checking their screens,” said Dr Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioural addiction and director of Nottingham Trent University’s International Gaming Research Unit. “Social media sites are chock-a-block with unpredictable rewards. They are trying to grab users’ attentions ... to make social media users create a routine and habitually check their screens.”Like gambling, which physically alters the brain’s structure and makes people more susceptible to depression and anxiety, social media use has been linked to depression and its potential to have an adverse psychological impact on users cannot be overlooked or underestimated.For instance, phone dependency, driven by high social-media usage, can lead us to think our phone is vibrating, or that we have received a message, even when we haven’t.“There are whole departments trying to design their systems to be as addictive as possible. They want you to be permanently online and by bombarding you with messages and stimuli try to redirect your attention back to their app or webpage.”Tech insiders have previously said “our minds can be hijacked” and that Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones, while some have confessed they ban their kids from using social media.A key reason for this is because Facebook has become so entrenched in our lives: we can’t put it down.Behavioural psychologist, Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has conceptualised how people become attached to social media.“It starts with a trigger, an action, a reward and then an investment and its through successive cycles, through these hooks, that habits are formed. We see them in all sorts of products, certainly in social media and gambling. This is a big part of how habits are changed.”Once a habit is formed something previously prompted by an external trigger, like a notification, email, or any sort of ring or ding, is no longer needed, Eyal remarked.It is replaced or supplemented with an internal trigger meaning that we form a mental association between wanting to use this product and seeking to serve an emotional need.“The products are built to be engaging and what’s engaging for some is addictive for others, that’s clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9318cf7e32c8937292bdafe9865ac128e1af8327/346_197_2906_1744/master/2906.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ead60dc1a413a8832b84e29ee2b6d77","title":"ubers self driving car saw the pedestrian but didnt swerve report","story":"Tuning of car’s software to avoid false positives blamed, as US National Transportation Safety Board investigation continuesAn Uber self-driving test car which killed a woman crossing the street detected her but decided not to react immediately, a report has said.The car was travelling at 40mph (64kmh) in self-driving mode when it collided with 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg at about 10pm on 18 March. Herzberg was pushing a bicycle across the road outside of a crossing. She later died from her injuries.Although the car’s sensors detected Herzberg, its software which decides how it should react was tuned too far in favour of ignoring objects in its path which might be “false positives” (such as plastic bags), according to a report from the Information. This meant the modified Volvo XC90 did not react fast enough.The report also said the human safety driver was not paying close enough attention to intervene before the vehicle struck the pedestrian.Arizona suspended Uber’s self-driving vehicle testing after the incident. The company later settled with Herzberg’s family.Uber and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident. Uber has already reached its preliminary conclusion, according to the report. A comprehensive NTSB report is expected later.“We’re actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we’ve built with NTSB, we can’t comment on the specifics of the incident,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles programme, and we have brought on former NTSB chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.”The collision marked the first fatality attributed to a self-driving car, the development of which has frequently been labelled as the only way to eliminate road deaths for those inside and outside the car.The incident was not the first controversy to involve Uber’s self-driving efforts, which the company sees as key to its survival as a ride-sharing or taxi firm. The company has been involved in a long-running battle with former Google self-driving car outfit Waymo over theft of technology around Anthony Levandowski. Uber’s self-driving technology was also called 5,000 times worse than Waymo’s in an independent analysis in 2017, while it has had legal tussles with various US states where it has tried to test vehicles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

He then walked down a long, red-carpeted corridor to a black limousine that whisked him to the nearby Grand Kremlin Palace, the former throne room of Russia’s tsars.Putin was applauded by about 5,000 guests as he entered the palace’s ornately decorated Andreyevsky Hall through colossal doors flanked by Kremlin guards. Among the guests were Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, Steven Seagal, the former Hollywood action star who has become close to Russia’s political elite, and Alexander Zaldostanov, the leather-clad, tattooed leader of a pro-Putin motorcycle club.With his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the Russian constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people faithfully. He also hailed Moscow’s ability to stand up for it interests in the international arena, and what he called Russia’s traditional values.Despite the pomp, the ceremony was relatively low key compared with Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012, when his black motorcade sped through deserted streets that had been cleared of residents by heavy-handed security forces. A Kremlin banquet to mark the inauguration was reportedly scrapped over fears it would lead to public criticism. Barring a change to the constitution, Putin’s fourth term is likely to be his last as president. He recently laughed off suggestions that he could return to the Kremlin in 2030, when he will be eligible to stand again. Government officials have not discussed the issue of his successor publicly, and analysts say the issue is taboo within the Kremlin walls.Since his last inauguration six years ago, Putin has seized Crimea from Ukraine, triggering western economic sanctions, and ordered Russia’s military into Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has been a useful bogeyman since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. UK military chiefs were spooked when\u0026nbspRussia, during an intervention in Ukraine, used a combination of drones and artillery to destroy Ukrainian armour, and raised questions about whether the UK would be able to do much better than the Ukrainians in similar circumstances.The UK is far enough away for Russia not to pose a territorial threat. But UK forces are deployed in the Baltic states along with US and other Nato forces as a deterrent in the unlikely event of a Russian landgrab.Russia does present a threat through hybrid warfare, or the use of deniable acts of disruption – primarily cyber-attacks on the UK that could disrupt essential services or interference in the democratic process, such as in elections.Just weeks before his election victory in March, Putin presented what he said were Moscow’s invincible new nuclear weapons, his bellicose speech accompanied by an animated video that showed Russian warheads falling on Florida. Fyodor Lukyanov, a political analyst who sometimes advises the Kremlin, has described the current standoff with the west as a state of cold war.Monday’s inauguration ceremony came just two days after Russian security forces assisted by Cossack fighters detained hundreds of people, including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, at an anti-Putin protest in central Moscow. The EU condemned “police brutality and mass arrests”, and human rights figures demanded an investigation into why Cossacks had been allowed to attack opposition supporters, including with leather whips. Russian opposition media said on Sunday that Moscow city hall has paid a pro-Kremlin Cossack organisation almost £190,000 to ensure public order in the Russian capital.Putin, who has ruled Russia for longer than anyone except Joseph Stalin, begins his new six-year term of office as an economic downturn has plunged millions of Russians into poverty. Russia’s economic slump has also meant an increasingly vicious struggle for resources among the country’s government and security apparatus, analysts say. Alexei Ulyukayev, the country’s former economy minister, was jailed for eight years in December on corruption charges that were widely interpreted as a rare case of Kremlin infighting spilling out into the open. The recent jailing of state security officials on corruption charges is also evidence of “intensified competition” for financial resources between officials at Russia’s interior ministry and the FSB intelligence agency, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political analyst.Opposition figures, who accuse Putin of caring only about the economic interests of his friends and family members, reacted with scorn to the former KGB officer’s inauguration pledge to serve ordinary Russians. “Putin said Russians will live better, but he didn’t say which ones,” read a popular online joke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb3aa2a847b025f36c7809ce2ed7a6bc5410cb4/0_263_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b99e06b305a33465e7962fb1a80478","title":"canadian activists pipeline tiny homes british columbia","story":"Much of Kinder Morgan pipeline’s proposed route lies within Secwepemc territory, and locals describe their fightback as ‘a matter of life and death’In the heart of the Canadian province of British Columbia, dozens of activists have been gathering to saw lumber, raise walls and install windows. By the time their work is done, 10 tiny homes will have been built – all in the name of thwarting a pipeline.Launched by a group called the Tiny House Warriors, the plan is to strategically deploy the homes to block the the expansion of the a pipeline running from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast.More than half of the Trans Mountain Expansion’s proposed route lies within Secwepemc territory, home to 17 First Nations bands and the world’s only inland temperate rainforest.“Our land is our home,” said Kanahus Manuel, who helped to launch Tiny House Warriors last year. “We’re putting tiny houses out there to scream that message to the world: pushing a pipeline through is tearing through our home.” Efforts to stop the pipeline expansion have heated up in recent weeks, and thousands of people have joined indigenous-led protests in British Columbia.The project, which still needs to obtain numerous local permits and approvals, has pitted the provincial governments in Alberta and British Columbia against each other. The pipeline would nearly triple the flow of the province’s landlocked bitumen to the west coast, but British Columbia fears the dramatic increase to oil tanker traffic in the Pacific could have an impact on its multibillion-dollar tourism industry.The pipeline’s owner, a subsidiary of the Texas-based energy company Kinder Morgan, announced it would walk away from the project unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May.Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said his government was prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward the pipeline, which he described as “a vital strategic interest to Canada” .In Secwepemc territory, which stretches across a wide swath of south-central British Columbia, the battle against the pipeline rings personal. “We feel like it’s a matter of life and death,” said Manuel. “We’ve depended on this land for tens of thousands of years. That’s the risk that we’re facing with the pipeline. And the uncertainty is whether our kids are going to be able to drink this water in 50 years.” Last year a Secwepemc assembly declared its opposition to the pipeline, even though three of the territory’s bands have signed agreements allowing the pipeline access. Among those supporting the project is Simpcw First Nation, who say they hold the title to one-third of the land that the pipeline aims to traverse. But those behind Tiny House Warriors point out that 17 bands call Secwepemc territory home. “No one person could sign over land that’s going to impact our collective right and title to our territory,” said Manuel.The territory is unceded, meaning no treaties were ever signed between Canada and the Secwepemc.At a build site 50km east of Kamloops, the group has so far built two of the tiny homes and a third is nearing completion. Secwepemc muralists and other artists will decorate each home with images drawn from the community’s traditional stories.The idea of using tiny houses seemed like a perfect fit to express the assembly’s opposition, said Manuel: juxtaposing a symbol of sustainable living against the environmental threat posed by the Trans Mountain project.What’s more, the homes can be built quickly and – because they are mobile – be moved around easily, assuaging the concerns of those who were part of a 2001 attempt to block the construction of a ski resort on their hunting and medicine-harvesting grounds.During that protest, community members built a cordwood house and a cabin on the land in hopes of hindering the development, only to watch as their work was bulldozed and members slapped with trespassing charges. This time the structures will be on wheels, said Manuel. “We didn’t want to be targeted and caught up in injunctions,” she added. “That’s not what we’re here for. We’re here to stop a pipeline.”The solar-powered homes will be used to house families in need, and some will likely be set aside to house language and cultural camps. After funds from Greenpeace helped to build the first house, crowdfunding campaigns enabled the group to easily raise the approximately C$5,000 needed to cover the cost of each house.As the May deadline for Kinder Morgan approaches, Manuel is hoping the small homes will offer a big platform for those in the community who have concerns over the project.“We know how it is when people see the militant, camouflaged masked-up native blocking the road or burning tires,” she said. “We know that that’s the frustration and the rage that a lot of our young people feel. But we know that we need to be creative because we know they have bigger guns, more handcuffs and police to take us away. We have to be creative with our resistance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54542b518931e5a81ad921ab19968164895a6630/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5bfa69cbbc695ace657c9daecc007ac","title":"hes not a populist hes popular nikol pashinyan becomes armenian pm","story":"Protest leader elected by parliamentary vote after leading weeks of peaceful demonstrations Exactly a month ago, Nikol Pashinyan was walking from village to village across Armenia in a desperate protest against a power grab by the country’s prime minister, Serzh Sargsyan.On Tuesday Pashinyan, a fiery political orator who has spent the past decade in street politics, was himself elected as prime minister in a 59-42 vote in parliament, capping weeks of peaceful mass protests.It has been an unlikely rise to power in the post-Soviet republic of about 3 million. Before April, the ruling Republican party’s stranglehold on Armenian politics had appeared intact, with Sargsyan newly installed as prime minister after term limits forced him to step down as president after 10 years.But governance changes that in tandem bolstered the prime minister’s office led to accusations that Sargsyan had manipulated the constitution to cling to power. Pashinyan and other activists brought out tens of thousands of people on to the streets for protests that paralysed the capital, Yerevan. Sargsyan resigned on 23 April in a stunning concession to the opposition. Pashinyan, who had been detained and then released from jail during the protests, called for snap elections to choose a new “people’s prime minister”.Supporters say Pashinyan, a former newspaper editor who was also imprisoned after opposition rallies in 2008 turned deadly, is among history’s great peaceful revolutionaries. “You can absolutely compare him with historical figures like Gandhi and Nelson Mandela,” said Eduard Aghajanyan, a city council member from Pashinyan’s Civil Contract party, and one of Pashinyan’s young, western-educated advisers.It has been a dangerous road for Pashinyan. He was expelled from university in 1995 for his political activities, and faced libel charges as the editor-in-chief of Haykakan Zhamanak in 2000. His car was blown up in an apparent assassination attempt in 2004, and in 2008 he spent months in hiding after being accused of instigating political protests that ended with 10 people dead. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2010 but was released the following year under an amnesty.He has publicly fallen out with other opposition leaders such as the former president Levon Ter-Petrosyan. In private, detractors say Pashinyan is a novice when it comes to working in government and unwilling to compromise. He entered parliament in 2016 as a member of a coalition of opposition parties.“The main question is whether Nikol Pashinyan the revolutionary can become Nikol Pashinyan the prime minister,” said Emil Danielyan, a journalist and political analyst in Yerevan. He has a flair for the theatrical. Last month Pashinyan told Sargsyan in face-to-face discussions that he had “come to discuss your resignation”. Sargsyan called the demand “political blackmail” and walked out of negotiations.Pashinyan has however shown a deft political touch over the past month, running a gauntlet of thorny political questions including whether Armenia should maintain close ties with Russia and whether there should be a purge of former ruling party officials and a criminal trial into the deaths of protesters in 2008.In an interview with the  during the protests, Pashinyan said dark political forces had been trying to derail Armenia’s peaceful revolution. His aides said Karen Karapetyan, the prime minister from September 2016 until last month, and who is close to Russia, had sought backroom deals to derail a vote last week for Pashinyan to become PM, which he lost. “Some forces are trying to engage us into political bargaining and propose me to become prime minister but ensure and guarantee the continuation of the existing system,” Pashinyan said. “And for me, my goal isn’t to become prime minister. My goal is bring real changes to Armenia.”He spoke of plans to further open Armenia to foreign business and break the control over certain industries held by businessmen close to the previous regime. Still, he and his supporters have largely skirted policy discussions in favour of rallying cries for reform in the poor country of about 3 million people, which borders Turkey and Iran and is locked in a simmering territorial conflict with another neighbour, Azerbaijan. There is a touch of the populist in Pashinyan – he has donned a camouflage T-shirt for some speeches, but returned to a suit for negotiations with other parties. “He is not a populist. He is popular,” said Ararat Mirzoyan, a fellow member of Civil Contract, who was arrested with Pashinyan last month.Mirzoyan said he had seen Pashinyan grow as a leader in recent years as the two worked together in parliament. Asked about the party’s specific policies, he said: “Only once we achieve fundamental reforms can we begin talking about the changes for the future sector by sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/802120709c90237b776a68560c56e2380aedb96c/0_13_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e14b4f028ac3ea044eca02e53ac7ff0a","title":"slaves working in uk construction and car washes report finds","story":"Labour abuse authority finds 17 sectors of British economy are high-risk for exploitationExploitation and abuse of workers is widespread across the UK economy, according to a new report, which finds that 17 sectors are high-risk for mistreatment ranging from wages theft to slavery.Construction, recycling, nail bars and car washes were among the top sectors where the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) said there was slavery. Agriculture, food packing, fishing, shellfish gathering, warehouse and distribution, garment manufacturing, taxi driving , retail, domestic work, and social care were also highlighted in the report.The authority has new powers to investigate labour abuse in all sectors under the 2016 Immigration Act, and the report marks its first full year of work assessing the nature of the problem in the UK. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority had previously been limited to tackling abuse in the agriculture, food and shellfish sectors. “It’s not until now that we’ve had the ability to look, but it’s a case of the more you look, the more you find,” said Ian Waterfield, the GLAA operations director. The authority says measuring the prevalence of labour exploitation is difficult, but an increasing number of suspected cases are being reported.About 150 years after most countries banned slavery – Brazil was the last to abolish its participation in the transatlantic slave trade, in 1888 – millions of men, women and children are still enslaved. Contemporary slavery takes many forms, from women forced into prostitution, to child slavery in agriculture supply chains or whole families working for nothing to pay off generational debts.\u0026nbspSlavery\u0026nbspthrives on every continent and in almost every country. Forced labour, people trafficking, debt bondage and child marriage are all forms of modern-day slavery that affect the world\u0027s most vulnerable people.Slavery exists in one form or another in every country. Asia accounts for more than half of the ILO\u0027s 21 million estimate. In terms of percentage of population, central and south-east Europe has the highest prevalence of forced labour, followed by Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.In 2005, the ILO estimated that illegal profits from forced labour amounted to more than $44bn. The UN\u0027s global initiative to fight trafficking says\u0026nbsppeople trafficking is the third-largest global criminal industry\u0026nbsp(pdf) behind drugs and arms trafficking. The ILO estimates that people in forced labour lose at least $21bn each year in unpaid wages and recruitment fees. Slavery also exists within global supply chains, generating huge profits for those who control this industry in free labour.The report also finds that organised crime groups are active in the labour market in many sectors. Most intelligence about victims of labour exploitation in the last 12 months has related to Romanian men in their 20s and 30s, while Romanian and British nationals are the most prevalent offender nationalities across all forms of modern slavery. Albanian organised crime is a significant factor in abuse in car washes. Long shifts of 12-15 hours a day, sometimes seven days a week, wages below the legal minimum or not paid at all, and dangerous working and living environments were issues common to several sectors. But different sectors also had problems specific to them. In nail bars the victims of trafficking for labour exploitation were mostly Vietnamese, with evidence that tax fraud and money laundering was also taking place. In the agriculture sector, the GLAA found evidence of 15-hour days, sometimes seven days a week, with double shifts without proper breaks, illegally low pay, serious safety incidents going unreported, and very poor living conditions. Romanian and Bulgarian workers were currently most at risk in this sector. Criminal groups were reported to be trafficking foreign workers into the food processing sector, with licensed companies warning they were being undercut by unlicensed ones.Wages in food service, hotels and catering could be as low as £10 per shift, with some employees working up to 15 hours a day, and sleeping on floors. In car washes, the GLAA found trafficking, 12-hour shifts seven days a week, wages below the legal minimum, dangerous accommodation on site, and exploitation of undocumented workers. Romanians made up the largest number of victims. Convoluted supply chains and subcontracting makes the UK construction sector, employing about 3 million workers, high-risk too. Its widespread use of self-employment contracts is directly linked to exploitation, according to the report. Gangmasters operating in the UK are also moving workers around internationally to meet shifting demand on building sites. The chair of the parliamentary select committee for work, Frank Field, said both government and consumers needed to wake up to the scale of abuse. “This report sheds much needed light on some of the most rotten, grotesque and evil practices that afflict the bottom of our labour market. Slave labour is being used to prop up companies in large swaths of the economy. What is puzzling is how the government machinery and consumer backlash have yet fully to come to terms with this phenomenon.” The NGO Focus on Labour Exploitation (Flex), which has recently researched the construction sector, said lack of resources was undermining government efforts on modern slavery. “Labour abuses put workers at a high risk of exploitation, with growing numbers in modern slavery – migrant and UK workers alike. We must urgently reverse the huge cuts to labour inspection in recent years,” its director, Caroline Robinson, said.Dumitru Popescu, a 41-year old Romanian, is one of the thousands of migrant workers who make up half the labour force in London’s construction industry.He had just finished a trial shift, working from 7.30am until 5.30pm without a break, demolishing a block of flats with hand tools because machine digging was prohibited. Compared with his previous job, this was good work and he wanted to keep it, so he was trying to calculate what he needed to pay the two Romanians who controlled employment on this site. He said that giving a cut of your wages each week to supervisors as protection money was how the system worked. Newcomers were given the most back-breaking jobs by paying his fellow Romanian overseers the right amount he would gradually move up the pecking order and stay safe on the same site. But how much that amount should be was not clear. He thought probably £50 a week but it was an anxious decision. Pay too little and you would be moved on and back to the bottom of the pile too much and you would be subsidising them to stand around while you sweated, he explained.Popescu (not his real name) has a contract with a large, high-profile recruitment agency which supplies thousands of workers for sites around Greater London. On paper, arrangements look fine and much better than queueing by the road in the places where contractors pick up day labour. He is paid £9.15 per hour – above the minimum wage – with deductions for tax and national insurance, but he said he did not really understand the deductions and thought they were too high, even before the protection money.His first job on arrival in the UK had been as a casual worker in leading hotels where the hours were completely unpredictable, varying from 12 hours one day to four hours the next with no notice. He moved to construction, where the first company he worked for cheated him out of his pay so he cut his losses and moved on. He was taken on as a casual to work on a flat renovation but was never paid for most of his work, the owner claiming he had run into financial difficulties. With the agency he thinks he will be able to work seven days a week averaging 10 hours a day and so make ends meet. His wife is a qualified social worker back home but does hotel work now in between looking after their daughter. The three of them live in a single room in a four-bedroomed house he rents with three other families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a986193634555691ef5d5381b32e158a5bfac0e/500_590_2077_1246/master/2077.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d2aac5406d59fe412348083b1bf5192","title":"turkish cypriot newspaper afrika editor sener levent enemy recep tayyip erdogan","story":"Şener Leven has made his tiny Turkish Cypriot newspaper an enemy of Turkey’s presidentŞener Levent is on a mission. He has survived being set on by mob and two gun attacks and has had a dead dog left at his door, but none has not stopped the editor taking Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to task. With evident pride, he says his Turkish Cypriot newspaper, Afrika, is the only Turkish-language daily to denounce Ankara’s military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. “I’ll continue writing the truth,” insisted Levent, who narrowly escaped being lynched in January when a mob of ultranationalists, incited by Erdoğan, attacked the publication’s premises in the Turkish-run north of Cyprus. “The Turkish army went into Syria and the Kurdish enclave of Afrin to commit a massacre and occupy the country, just as they did here.”Such defiance has not gone unnoticed. Media repression is at the root of growing international concern over Erdoğan’s increasingly authoritarian style. More than 150 journalists have been jailed, many on tenuous terror charges, following the failed July 2016 coup. Criticism of Turkey’s cross-border operation is high on the list of perceived infractions, which is why Levent’s newspaper is in Erdoğan’s sights. “It is a crime now to be a good person in Turkey because if you are good you are imprisoned,” he lamented, sitting behind a chaotic, paper-stacked desk. “It is even a crime to say ‘no’ to war in Turkey. No country is my enemy, but I am absolutely against Erdoğan’s and his Islamofascist regime. Why did he start this war? Because he needs this war to consolidate his power.”Afrika is one of 20 dailies produced in northern Cyprus, the breakaway republic where Ankara has stationed 35,000 troops since invading in response to a coup aimed at union with Greece in 1974.Run on a shoestring budget, its circulation is about 2,000. Its web presence is similarly limited. Even among Turkish Cypriots, Levent’s contrarian views – he refuses to submit to Ankara’s line that 1974 was a “peace operation” – are prone to eliciting derision. His own office, down a long, bare, dark corridor, is decorated with tapestries of Che Guevara and other leftwing heroes who like him, the 70-year-old bohemian laughs, were once dismissed as “marginals” and “provocateurs”.But while the editor clearly delights in his role as a gadfly, Turkish Cypriots have rallied around him. As Erdoğan seeks to crush dissent in the run-up to snap legislative and presidential elections in June, many are alarmed that Afrika should be singled out. Within hours of ordering the assault on Afrin, the Turkish president spoke at a rally and denounced the newspaper as “cheap and nasty”. He criticised the publication for comparing the Syrian offensive to Turkey’s actions in 1974 and exhorted his “brothers in northern Cyprus to give the necessary response”.The next day, Afrika’s first-floor premises were viciously attacked as flag-waving protesters, hurling bottles and stones, took up his call. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, again raised the issue of Afrika in March, appealing to his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Tufan Erhürman, to bring “the unpleasant voices” under control. All of which leaves Levent, who was born and raised on the island when it was a British colony, a little stunned. “It is crazy that such a powerful man should be afraid of such a small newspaper,” he said, his voice gravelly from Dunhill cigarettes. “I am very proud that we are the only Turkish-language newspaper writing about what is really happening in Afrin.” The building housing Afrika still bears scars from the attack. For more than a month after, Levent had the office’s smashed windows encased in thick chipboard, forcing staff to work in the semi-darkness. The balcony, which protesters tried to scale, was barricaded, enhancing the sense of siege. There is still blood on the wall and a gash in the office’s front door, a stark reminder of the bullet that pierced it when a would-be assassin turned up in 2011. Levent now has a CCTV monitor on his desk so he can keep an eye on the main entrance. Since the attack in January, he comes to work with a gun. “I thought there’ll be a battle here if they come again,” he said. He said he is still shocked that it had taken so long for the police to stop the assault given the building’s location between the parliament, presidential office and Turkish embassy. Police only responded when the enclave’s president, Mustafa Akıncı, intervened. While distancing himself from Levent’s views, Akıncı deplored the attack as an assault on freedom of expression.Soon after, thousands of Turkish Cypriots took to the streets to protest Turkey’s role in agitating “fascist” segments to silence Afrika and other voices of dissent. Six of the attack’s protagonists were rounded up and sentenced to jail terms of between two and six months. Another nine remain at large. His case has been raised with the EU by the government in the internationally-recognised Greek south. Although EU laws are suspended in the north, because of the island’s ided status, Turkish Cypriots are EU citizens.Levent acknowledges that the 40-mile channel that separates Cyprus from Turkey offers a measure of protection that mainland critics do not have, but he worries that the light sentences will invite further violence at a time when even a wrongly worded tweet in Turkey is considered a crime. “Every day I ask, where is justice? Why haven’t the others been arrested?” he said. “An attack can come tonight, tomorrow, any time. “I have a particular philosophy. I am not afraid,” he said, adding that Hamlet’s “readiness is all” speech guides him when the going gets tough. “A person lives once and dies once. If you are to die, at least die with honour.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481526.1525634953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house rules how to get your first mortgage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThings which help demonstrate a borrower’s desirability to a bank include savings and paying rent.

Video: ITV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRobert  Peston on ‘Peston on Sunday’. Photograph: ITVTV presenter Robert Peston has suggested that Ireland has “undermined” British governments for at least the last century. In an interview with prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mr Peston described the Tory as a keen student of British history, before saying: “Ireland has undermined, the issue of Ireland in so many different ways has undermined, British governments, you know, going back well over 100 years now.” Mr Rees-Mogg responded by suggesting that the issue of Ireland had undermined British politics for “much more than 100 years. It’s a very long and complex history.”The interview took place on Mr Peston’s eponymous Peston on Sunday programme on ITV. Mr Peston suggested to Mr Rees-Mogg that in the absence of a post-Brexit customs arrangement, any Border checks could “undermine the peace that . . . has been so beneficial over the past few years”. Mr Rees-Mogg responded by stating that it was “deeply disgraceful that people who wish to keep us in the European Union are threatening the spectre of a return to terror to try and make people accept their views”. He said that those who raised the prospect of a return to violence “are all committed Europeans, some of them in receipt of pensions from the EU. “I think it’s deeply disgraceful to raise the spectre of lawlessness and of murder in pursuit of a political objective.” Mr Rees-Mogg pointed to the pro-Brexit stance of one of the key architects of the Belfast Agreement, former UUP leader David Trimble. Mr Trimble has said he does not share the contention of some Remainers that a return to a hard Border could undermine the peace process. Mr Rees-Mogg is one of the foremost Tories advocating that the UK leave both the customs union and the single market. He suggested during the interview that leaving both entities while keeping a soft Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland would be “very straightforward”, as neither the British nor the Irish government wanted to impose a hard Border. He cited claims by the head of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, that a Border already exists between the Republic and the North. “It’s important to remember that there already is a Border: there is a Border for currency there is a Border for immigration there is a Border for excise, and there is a Border for VAT. But this does not need a physical infrastructure at the Border, and that’s what a hard Border is,” Mr Rees-Mogg said. “There may indeed need to be non-Border checks that take place – that would be perfectly reasonable in the new situation. But if we remain in the customs union and the single market, we’d lose the advantages of leaving.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2017/06/24/TELEMMGLPICT000132920045_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"archbishop canterbury preparing royal wedding listening stormzy","story":"Stormzy performing on The Other Stage at the Glastonbury FestivalThe Archbishop of Canterbury is taking inspiration from a Stormzy song as he nervously prepares for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding.The Most Rev Justin Welby will officiate the highly anticipated ceremony on May 19, but even the Church of England\u0027s most senior cleric is not safe from the nerves of the big day.Speaking on BBC Coventry \u0026amp Warwickshire he told of how he is preparing for the ceremony.Mr Welby said: I\u0027m always nervous at weddings because it is such an important day for the couple - whoever they are.The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin WelbyI\u0027ve made a couple of cack-handed mistakes over the last couple of weddings I\u0027ve been involved in and I\u0027m thinking this is probably not a good moment to make it a hat-trick.He has previously admitted to fearing he might drop the ring during the serviceStormzy performs on stage at The BRIT Awards 2017 When asked by presenter Lorna Bailey how he\u0027s preparing himself, the Archbishop said a line from grime artist Stormzy\u0027s song, Blinded By Your Grace, was helping him in the run up to the nuptials.Mr Welby explained: There\u0027s a line in that - \u0027I stay prayed up and get the job done\u0027 - I think that sort of sums it up.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleThe Archbishop, who is the second most senior figure in the church after the Queen, who is supreme governor of the Church of England, has already had an instrumental role in preparing Ms Markle for the wedding.In March he officiated as she was baptised and confirmed into the church in a secret ceremony, describing it as beautiful and very special.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleXi Jinping and Kim Jong-un in second meeting in ChinaVanilla ice cream off the menu as traders cannot afford the spiceBride whose arm was ripped off in crocodile attack speaks of \u0026#39miracle\u0026#39 escape as the 8ft predator is shot dead Princess Eugenie to marry Jack Brooksbank: Date, details and latest news about 2018\u0026#39s second Royal weddingBank Holiday clean up: Litter groups say public must pick up their own rubbish because councils cannot afford toThe Woman in White, episode 5, review: as close to definitive as an adaptation can beNorth Korea proposes new air route through peninsulaFather who blamed his son for murder he committed jailed for at least 26 yearsWhat time is the Royal Wedding?

The main photo shows that some some selfish people didn\u0027t even bother attempting to tidy up after themselves, even though there\u0027s a bin in clear view.”Last month councils across England were given the power to raise fines for dropping litter to £150Other Twitter users also voiced their anger over the mess that has been left in their local green spaces.Joe Lycett said: “Hate to sound like your mother but if you enjoyed the beauty of Cannon Hill Park yesterday then the least you can do is respect it and the safety of the animals that live in it by putting your rubbish in a bin.”Judith Watson added: “So this morning I picked up litter in Parsonage Gardens because the lazy folk who sat in the gardens yesterday with their Pret sandwiches, tins of G\u0026ampT and Primark shopping couldn’t be bothered to put their rubbish into the actual bins provided.”Keep Britain Tidy chief executive Allison Ogden-Newton explained that whilst it was wonderful that the warm weather had seen people enjoying the outdoors, it was the act of “thoughtless people” who deemed it acceptable to damage the environment for everyone.Clean Up Britain urged people to take their own rubbish homeKeep Britain Tidy estimate that the cost of cleaning up litter, as well as local authority street cleansing and fly-tipping removal is likely to be costing councils close to £1 billion a year.Speaking last month on the increased littering fines, environment Minister Therese Coffey said: “These new fines will tackle anti-social behaviour by hitting litter louts in the pocket, whether it\u0027s litter that is thrown from a vehicle or dropped in the street.“Littering is a scourge on our environment and we waste taxpayers\u0027 money cleaning it up - funds which could be better spent in the community.“We want to be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we found it, and I encourage everyone to take responsibility for their litter and recycle more.”Hampshire Fire and Rescue service were called to a BBQ bin on fire on Southsea CommonWarnings were also put out by local firefighters after multiple calls were made to bins on fire after people had thrown away their reusable BBQs into bins and skips.A spokesman from Cornwall fire service said: Please make sure barbecues are disposed of safely after use in this fine weather.

A 2015 drought worsened the situation, it says.The agency currently aims to assist 650,000 women and children there each month providing fortified cereals and biscuits.Funding shortfalls have meant that rations have had to be reduced and suspended in some cases, WFP said in a statement coinciding with the start of the May 8-11 visit by WFP executive director David Beasley.It gave no details, but figures on the WFP website show that its $52 million appeal for 2018 is only 19.2 per cent funded. Switzerland, Sweden and France are among the leading donors.“WFP has been working in DPR Korea for more than two decades, helping to strengthen food security in the country and provide nutritious food to women and children, Beasley said.This week, I will visit schools and nurseries to meet some of the mothers and young children WFP is supporting, as well as to understand the needs of the operation, which at this point is under-funded.”WFP and the UN Children\u0027s Fund (UNICEF) are among only a few aid agencies with access to North Korea, which suffered famine in the mid-1990s that killed up to three million people.UNICEF said in January that an estimated 60,000 North Korean children face potential starvation. It blamed international sanctions targeting the country\u0027s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes for exacerbating the situation by slowing aid deliveries and making fuel scarcer and more expensive.Please review our commenting policyXi Jinping and Kim Jong-un in second meeting in ChinaVanilla ice cream off the menu as traders cannot afford the spiceBride whose arm was ripped off in crocodile attack speaks of \u0026#39miracle\u0026#39 escape as the 8ft predator is shot dead Princess Eugenie to marry Jack Brooksbank: Date, details and latest news about 2018\u0026#39s second Royal weddingBank Holiday clean up: Litter groups say public must pick up their own rubbish because councils cannot afford toThe Woman in White, episode 5, review: as close to definitive as an adaptation can beArchbishop of Canterbury preparing for Royal wedding by listening to StormzyFather who blamed his son for murder he committed jailed for at least 26 yearsWhat time is the Royal Wedding?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

You’re at a party. You know no one but the host and they’ve had to rush to the kitchen to rescue some smoking vol-au-vents from the oven. You spot a friendly looking fellow guest, also on their own, and sidle over to make their acquaintance by the buffet table. You swap names. You compare notes on your respective journeys to the venue. You talk about the weather. Hasn’t it been strange this year? So far so good. Now what?The host passes by with those vol-au-vents. You grab one and shove it in your mouth. And before you’ve entirely finished eating it you come out with the line, “So, what do you do?”If this were the 1970s, the needle would skitter across the vinyl on the record player, bringing the music to an abrupt and ugly end. As it is, the entire room falls silent as everyone turns to stare.The etiquette guide to Whatsapp group chatsIt’s not that your mouth is still full of vol-au-vent crumbs. Though that is pretty disgusting. It’s because they’re thinking: “You just asked what?”You just asked somebody what they do? Quelle horreur. You thought you were making small talk but you’ve accidentally outed yourself as being a bit of a prat.           I had no idea you weren’t supposed to ask people “what they do” until I was about 35 and I read an article by one of those etiquette gurus who if he had any real manners, wouldn’t spend so much time pronouncing on other people’s. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. I was sure I had asked that question on many occasions. I’d certainly answered it. Did people think I was an ill-mannered oaf? The etiquette expert did not, alas, go into the reasons for his pronouncement and I was left none the wiser.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent awkward conversationsSo why don’t people like being asked what they do?Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.  Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on orce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.   Everything you need to know about dating app etiquetteNovelists have it worst of all. It’s my experience that upon hearing I’m a novelist (having already worked out that I’m not JK Rowling or EL James), nine out of 10 people want to tell me about the book they’re writing. Could I show it to my publisher? Or they’ll tell me about a story they have that’s just bound to be a bestseller only they don’t have time to write it themselves. Perhaps I could write it for them and they’ll give me 10 per cent of the proceeds? Does that sound reasonable? Only once in my 20-year career has a complete stranger ever told me a story that made me want to reach for my pen.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent those awkward conversations, so I do understand why “what do you do” can be a loaded question.But let’s be realistic. It’s not easy to make small talk with a stranger. I would never cut someone dead or judge their social standing just because they’d resorted to the easy questions on a first encounter. Sometimes you really don’t know what else to say. Modern conversation is a veritable minefield. It used to be that you should never talk about religion or politics but the list of subjects that are verboten seems to grow by the day. We can’t all talk about the weather until the end of time. Though having said that, hasn’t the weather been strange?If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with ‘I’m a water slide tester’.When I said I was going to be writing about the questions we just can’t ask each other, because they’re considered impolite or because they’re actually illegal (such as “how old are you” in certain contexts), a friend of mine agreed with the etiquette expert that asking “what do you do” was the very height of bad manners. My friend would admit to having asked the question only once so far as he could remember, saying that he’d deployed it in desperation at a fancy dinner party. His neighbour at the table was monosyllabic. The conversation was going absolutely nowhere so my friend dropped the “wdyd” bomb thinking that at least if he found out his neighbour was an accountant, they could talk about taper relief.“I’m a drummer,” said the man.“In your spare time?”Apparently the conversation didn’t pick up after that.So, what can you ask instead? A better question is perhaps, “What do you do in your free time?” Whereas people often have to work at jobs they hate just to pay the mortgage, what they do in their free time should, by definition, be something they simply enjoy. Maybe the actuary you’ve already dismissed as boring is passionate about the Argentine tango, imbuing every step with the spirit of the brave and unruly gaucho. They might have danced you into bed. So ask what someone loves to do before you ask them what they have to do. Whether the answer is “needlework, specifically cross-stitch” or “attending furring conventions in the New Forest dressed a hamster”, there’s got to be at least 10 minutes more conversation to be had.Eleven etiquette rules to remember next time you flyMan who studied rich people found 3 etiquette aspects they never shirkEtiquette coach prompts outrage by claiming Christmas tinsel is commonIf you say these 28 words, you\u0027re poshA pool etiquette guide for mothers braving a family holidayMeanwhile, the perfect response to “what do you do” has to be “what do I do about what?” If you’re feeling mean, that is. If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with “I’m a water slide tester”. It’s an actual job. You have to rate theme park water slides for exhilaration and splash factor. You just need to be able to swim. Imagine what’ll go through your new friends’ minds when they hear that’s what you get up to all day. Interestingly, despite the etiquette snob’s assertion that enquiring after someone’s occupation marks you out as not being from “the top drawer” as it were, I’ve heard that when they’re meeting people in those interminable line-ups, the Royals always ask “and what do you do?”I wonder if anyone has ever asked the same question in return?*Of course he wasn’t in U2.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of paying privately for dialysis sessions in the EU is up to €1,000 (£880) a week depending on the circumstances and procedures used.”Jeremy Hunt supported Remain during the referendum (Getty)Charities echoed the MEPs’ comments, warning that long-term conditions would continue to “cross borders” whatever the political status of the UK.Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, told The Independent: “Every day we hear from people who are anxious about the very real possibility that their freedom to travel could be curtailed due to changes in reciprocal healthcare rights. Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.“For the 29,000 people in the UK who have kidney failure and who need dialysis to stay alive, the EHIC system is essential to allow them to travel in Europe. Everyone has the right to live their lives to the full, including people on dialysis so we need a clear commitment from the government to protect kidney patients post-Brexit. “Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.”In the early stages of withdrawal talks, the EU guaranteed that anyone abroad at the point of Brexit would be able to retain their EHIC card. But there has been no reported movement on the status of the card for other travellers, making up the vast majority of the population.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and one of the letter’s signatories, added: “Far from providing a boost to the NHS – Brexit means all patients lose their free healthcare rights when travelling abroad in the EU.“It’s time Jeremy Hunt stood up for the NHS and the vulnerable in these negotiations.“Whatever the Brexit deal looks like, the British people should have the final say on whether they think it is as good as the deal we have now inside the EU.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian President Vladimir Putin walks before his President inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow.Lava from a robust fissure eruption on Kilauea\u0027s east rift zone consumes a home, then threatens another, near Pahoa, Hawaii.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it should worry the Tories too.If they fail to take us out of the EU entirely, including any restrictive ­customs union, they are staring into the abyss. We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down.

But it also has to recognise the precarious position it’s in.The ­Government is in a state of paralysis. It must start offering something positive to Remainers — especially those under 47 who lean towards Labour.Jeremy Corbyn’s vision is economically insane, but at least he has one.

Corbyn’s excuses for Russia and Assad didn’t help.Nor do voters like being hectored in public by arrogant young Corbyn cultists convinced of their own moral superiority.Brexit-backers, meanwhile, know Labour cannot be trusted.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

But critics say this puts lawyers off taking complex cases, which can require weeks of preparation. Around 100 barrister chambers have refused to take on new publicly funded cases since April 1, as a result of the proposed change. It comes as the Ministry of Justice faces a 40% cut in its overall budget, which is set to fall by \u0026pound600 million in the next two years.

Harry Butt has been left with severe concussion, a swollen nose and a huge black eye after the ball hit him in the face with a dramatic thud, knocking him to the floor. His family say he\u0027s been suffering from hearing and eyesight problems since the ball smashed into him after flying over the fence while he was at a friend\u0027s house. Horror footage of the incident shows the moment the child was knocked to the floor from the dramatic impact of the ball. The family are demanding safety improvements at Poole Grammar School in Dorset, saying The next victim might not be so lucky. They have been backed by residents of the area, who are demanding something is done before someone else is seriously injured, or worse. The school has said it is the first such incident to happen, but said it is one incident too many, confirming they are reviewing the scheduling of matches on their pitches.  Michelle, of Canford Heath, Dorset, had taken Harry and her 12-year-old twin daughters to visit friends before heading off on a holiday camping trip to Weymouth. They were on the driveway of the house saying goodbye when the ball whistled past Michelle\u0027s ear and struck Harry. She said It sounded like a bomb had gone off - my little boy was on the floor. We were all in shock and he was dazed. We took him to A\u0026ampE and we were admitted to hospital. He was violently sick, had really bad concussion and the consultant said if it had hit him anywhere else, he wouldn\u0027t be here. It hit him on the forehead, on the side. Harry, who goes to Ad Astra Infant School, was allowed home, with Michelle under strict instructions to keep a close eye on him for the next fortnight and to return to hospital if she\u0027s worried. She has already been back once as he now has two black eyes, cannot breathe through his nose as it is so swollen, and is having trouble hearing.  We are on day five and he\u0027s not himself, he\u0027s crying every night. I\u0027m still in shock - I still hear the noise. It\u0027s just awful and I want something done. The school called Michelle who claims they said they could not raise the height of the fence due to health and safety, as the site was \u0027too windy\u0027. But she said they told her they would move future cricket matches to an alternative field. Michelle claimed residents of Haslar Road had been complaining for years about cricket balls coming over the fence and hitting their cars, conservatories and ending up on their roofs.

Beaches, parks and countryside hotspots across the country have been left covered with litter after millions of sunseekers descended on them. Plastic rubbish, nappies, windbreakers and disposable barbecues are among the many used items left scattered along the UK\u0027s coastline. Takeaway boxes, empty cans of beer, food packets and plastic bags have also been dumped by visitors who failed to put them in the bin. Photos of the post-holiday mess have sparked outrage, with many people accusing \u0027disrespectful\u0027 litterers of \u0027ruining\u0027 beauty spots for others.  Taking to Twitter this morning, one disappointed woman expressed her shock at the state of the beach in Blackpool, Lancashire. She wrote: Cannot believe how much rubbish was all over Blackpool beach after bank holiday! Like the aftermath of a festival. There are bins at every set of steps up and down the prom, there is no excuse for this. All of this is going to end up in the sea. Meanwhile, comedian Joe Lycett shared a picture of the mess in Birmingham\u0027s Cannon Hill Park, as he urged people to use bins. Joe, 29, tweeted: Hate to sound like your mother but if you enjoyed the beauty of Cannon Hill Park yesterday then the least you can do is respect it and the safety of the animals that live in it by putting your rubbish in a bin. Here’s a selfie I took with your mess!!!  Today, volunteers were left having to litter-pick at beauty spots after tonnes of debris were dumped at the sites instead of being put in bins. Some residents, shocked by the appalling state of their local beaches, called for the introduction of a dedicated litter police to fine those flouting the rules. Some of the worst scenes were in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, where hundreds of plastic water bottles had been left behind on the beach. The sand was barely visible over the weekend due to the amount of visitors - but the aftermath has been dubbed a disgrace. PC Daryl Jones tweeted: Now there\u0027s nothing more I love than a day off...especially when the sun is shining. However if you come to our town to enjoy the weather please tidy up your rubbish!!!!!!! There is no excuse.    He accompanied the post with a picture of the litter-covered coastline. Another local said: We could have signs on the beach saying how would you like it if we came into your home stayed for the day and left our rubbish on your floor with a picture of a seagull with a beer pack holder round their neck. And the shocking scene was repeated across the country. In Barry Island, south Wales, angry locals called for the introduction of patrolling litter police with the power to hand out fines. Rob Weaver said: We need litter police with the power to fine, or remove people from the beach. Another added: If you\u0027ve left any rubbish on the beach at Barry Island today then you should be ashamed of yourselves. Disgusting.  Yesterday evening, community volunteers Friends of Barry Beaches posted on Facebook about the disgusting behaviour of some visitors. They wrote: After a fabulous bank holiday, we thought we’d take a walk over Barry Island. At 6.30pm the beach was still full, but signs of the litter people had discarded was clear to see already. The only word to describe the behaviour of these inconsiderate visitors is disgusting. What is wrong with you? If you had turned up this morning to a beach covered in rubbish , would you have stayed? The answer is no. You came to the beach to experience the beautiful sandy beach and sea in the sunshine and enjoy the delights of Barry Island. Please have the decency to leave it the way you found it. Facebook user Paige Jones shared the post, writing: People are disgusting!!! Ruin it for everyone because they can’t put rubbish in the bin. Instead they would rather it wash out to sea or blow all over land.    She added: Anywhere I can apply to be part of the rubbish police \u0026amp kick these people up the butt. Earlier, a mum had warned that she had found a needle on the beach at Barry Island when the tide was out. She said her little girl was inches from standing on it. Meanwhile, at Botany Bay in Kent, bins were left overflowing with trash. One upset visitor said: The price we pay for tourism. Others were upset by the state of nearby Margate beach, which was also left littered in plastic waste. Margate beach looks f****** disgusting with all people\u0027s rubbish just left on it from the long weekend, one local Tweeted. People wonder why and how we are killing our sea and the animals in and out of it.  People need to grow up and take responsibility for what they are doing to it. Others lamented the amount of plastic left on Branksome Beach near Poole, Dorset, where hundreds of items of plastic were left following the weekend\u0027s heatwave. And Bournemouth beach was also badly affected, with many people even leaving their fold-up chairs in the shadow of the pier. Twitter account Bournemouth Litter - set up to highlight the town\u0027s growing litter problem - posted several heartbreaking images of plastic water bottles and beer cans on the area\u0027s seven miles of golden sands. Rubbish bins were also overflowing with junk. The account Tweeted: The morning after the bank holiday. At least the bins are being used, but they now dominate the walkways and views on the beach.    Deano Leith posted a picture of a seagull picking among litter left on Scarborough beach, North Yorkshire, on Sunday. He added: So much litter on the beach! People really don\u0027t give a monkeys about their waste. So much plastic left behind for the tide to take away. Bins overflowing the whole place is a disgrace. It\u0027s a damn shame. Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive Allison Ogden-Newton said: On a gorgeous bank holiday thousands of us flock to our beaches and parks because they are beautiful, clean and great places to enjoy the sunshine with our families. But some people seem to think it is acceptable to walk away at the end of the day, leaving their rubbish behind and destroying the very beauty they went there to enjoy.  It is not, neither can we use the excuse that \u0027the bins were full\u0027. If the bins are full, then you should take your rubbish home with you. You took it there, you take it away again. Those thoughtless people who leave their litter are damaging our environment for everyone. Dr Sue Kinsey, Senior Pollution Policy Officer at the Marine Conservation Society said: It\u0027s a shame that such a beautiful few days at the beach were spoiled by so much rubbish being left thoughtlessly behind. These pictures highlight the need for urgent action on plastics including the introduction of a deposit return scheme for all sizes of containers - plastic, glass and metal, levies and charges on items such as cups and straws and banning of certain plastics altogether such as polystyrene and black plastic.

Carys Pickles is allergic to everything from sunshine to ice cream and she can\u0027t be out in the sun for five minutes without being covered in itchy red hives. Mum Sophie, 25, said she lives in fear of what Carys might react to next after the little girl has been rushed to hospital several times with life-threatening reactions. Little Carys has had severely sensitive skin since she was born and she also reacts to the chlorine in swimming pools, sun tan lotion, grass, and even some ice-cream, due to an intolerance to cow\u0027s milk.   Poor Carys wasn\u0027t even able to enjoy a family barbeque this bank holiday weekend - because of a severe allergy to tomato ketchup that her pals would be smearing all over their burgers and hot dogs .  Sophie has been forced to cancel their summer holiday this year in fear that Carys will have a potentially fatal reaction abroad. When she was five-days-old we had to call an ambulance because she had a reaction to milk, and they\u0027ve just got worse since. Now, the family, including dad Liam, 30, and sisters Amelia, five, and Phoebe, nine-months-old, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, are searching for ways her daughter can be pain-free for the next few months.  Sophie, a stay-at-home mum, said: Summer is meant to be the most exciting time of year for kids, but for Carys it\u0027s one of the most dangerous times. Ever since she was born she\u0027s been allergic to a lot of things, but over the past year it\u0027s got even worse. We\u0027re dreading the summer because there\u0027s so many precautions that we have to take to make sure she\u0027s not in pain. She\u0027s even allergic to sun tan lotion, so we have to use a special one for her, and swimming pools, so she can\u0027t go in there to cool down. And we have to be careful at BBQs in case Carys gets hold of tomato ketchup, as she will come out in a rash.  Despite Carys\u0027 allergy to the sunshine only being identified last year, she has suffered with reactions since she was born. And after being rushed to hospital several times with life-threatening reactions, Sophie now lives in fear of what her daughter will react to next. She added: Every day it seems there\u0027s something new that Carys reacts to, and it\u0027s a constant fear of how bad the next reaction will be. When she was five-days-old we had to call an ambulance because she had a reaction to milk, and they\u0027ve just got worse since.

According to insiders workers repairing the roof of Apartment 1, Kensington Palace, were instructed to complete the job quickly, as Prince Harry made it clear him and Meghan plan to start a family soon. Royal courtiers were last year keen to let it be known that the couple would immediately be living at Nottingham Cottage - Harry’s batchelor pad in the grounds of the Kensington Palace - for the foreseeable future. But insiders have known for some time that it was always Harry\u0027s intention to move out of the cosy two-bed Nott Cott as soon as possible and into Apartment 1 - a stunning 21-room wing of the palace.  It was revealed yesterday that the Duke of Gloucester agreed to move out of Apartment 1 shortly after the engagement to allow Harry and Meghan to move in. The Daily Mail\u0027s Royal expert Richard Kay wrote: “Soon after their engagement, the Queen’s cousin Richard — the Duke of Gloucester, 73 — whose three children are now grown up, offered to vacate his splendid 21-room Apartment 1 at the palace so Harry and Meghan could have it — it is next door to William and Kate. The question was, where would the Gloucesters go? “Now the problem has been solved with the departure of the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt. This has freed up his smaller but very comfortable apartment, seen as ideal for the unfussy Gloucesters, who still carry out many official duties.  The Queen has allowed father-of-two Sir Christopher, 56, to stay on for six months at the prestigious address until the end of the school year. “So when will Harry and Meghan move in? Well, it was more than a year after their wedding before William and Kate moved into Princess Margaret’s old home. “Right now Meghan and Harry are content with the intimate comforts of Nottingham Cottage, with its open fire and chintzy furnishings. Meghan’s influence is everywhere — cashmere throws, scented candles and vases of fresh flowers. “They are putting off as long as possible the dreaded time when they will have to have umpteen servants.  They borrow staff from Clarence House to help out when they really need them for dinner parties. Neither of them is a very good cook. “This extends to cleaning the cottage. Rather than have their own staff, they are using contract cleaners Mitie, the company that ‘does’ the royal palaces. “At the same time, they have been slipping away from the bustle of London to the relative peace of Windsor, where a bolthole at the castle has been made available for their occasional use as they prepare for what will be one of the most microscopically observed occasions of recent times.” Harry and Meghan certainly seem to be in rather a hurry to get a family started. The pace of their romance has been swift to say the least in Royal terms.  Harry spoke back in November of last year about the speed at which he fell for Meghan - it was love at first sight, he said. Lifting the lid on their whirlwind romance, he said \u0027the stars were aligned\u0027 when \u0027this beautiful woman fell into my life\u0027. Harry, 33, also promised he and the American actress, 36, will start a family \u0027in the near future\u0027. The compact cottage is no place for a young prince and his bride to plan for a family. And this might well explain the pace at which work has been rattling on at Apartment 1.  As news crew gathered on last November on the east side of Kensington Palace, it almost seemed as if workers on the roof on the west side of the building were trying to hurriedly remove the gleaming white plastic covering in double quick time so as not to draw attention to renovations. Beneath the sheets it was plain to see that renovations to the roof of Apartment 1 had been happening at lightening quick pace after only a few weeks with new mortar pointing over the chimney stacks clearly visible. Panoramic pictures of the Kensington Palace back then showed the world\u0027s media on the east side of the palace while work on Apartment 1 rattled along unnoticed on the west side of the building. Pictures taken in November showed the entire Apartment 1 still shrouded in white tarpaulins.  Apartment 1 adjoins the 20-room Apartment 1A which Harry’s brother Prince William and his growing family live in. William and Kate also lived at Nottingham Cottage before they started a family - it almost seems like a right of passage for the two Royal brothers. Work on apartment 1 is now almost completed - just in time for Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan in less than two weeks’ time. The Gloucesters also have other properties they can happily spend time at. A source said: “The Gloucesters have two other properties: Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire, which they rent out, and a weekend cottage in Gloucestershire, which they could retire to.”  Several years ago a royal spokesman said that Harry had set his sights on grander accommodation at Kensington Palace but refused to confirm which apartment it was, other than to say it was currently occupied. In 2014, another member of the family, Princess Michael, suggested in an interview with Tatler magazine that Apartment 1 would be perfect for Harry to move in to when he got older and wanted to start a family. Princess Michael said William and Kate have a “lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.” She added: “They’re rattling around this huge space and I think Prince Harry might go there. Then they’d be next door to each other - very good move.”  It has been rumoured for some time that Harry had his eyes on another larger apartment in Kensington Palace for him and Meghan to move into. The rumoured new apartment was said to be much closer to the huge wing that has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since September, when they moved back to London from Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate to coincide with Prince George starting school in Battersea. Indeed Apartment 1 and Apartment 1A are as close together as it is possible to be - they are linked by adjoining doors so Harry and Meghan can come and go to see Kate and William and also visit young Prince George and Princess Charlotte whenever they choose. ‘It\u0027s sweet that Harry and Meghan will be living next to William and Kate. When Harry and Meghan move in permanently, it will be like when William and Harry were kids when their mother was alive - living next door to one another at Kensington Palace.

Brits flocked to parks yesterday as The Met Office confirmed this year\u0027s early May bank holiday weekend as officially the hottest on record, and temperatures passed 28C. But it\u0027s bad news for Brits as low pressure will push aside the warmth in favour of more wet and windy weather. By midweek, the jet stream will have moved further south allowing cooler, more unsettled conditions to move across the country. The drop will start to be felt tomorrow when the mercury will struggle to reach the low teens compared to the high 20s enjoyed yesterday.  Met Office Forecaster Helen Roberts said highs of 28C (82.4F) were expected today, with the south east and central southern England seeing the warmest conditions, followed by a massive drop in temperature as the week progresses. She told the Press Association: Much of England will have a really decent morning, lots of sunshine. It gradually clouds over across West Midlands into the early afternoon, but central and eastern areas tend to hold onto the sunshine for longer.  The warm weather might trigger thunderstorms later this afternoon and into the evening, most likely in East Anglia, London and the south east, the Met Office said. It will start to feel fresher and rain will spread eastwards from the Atlantic across Wales, the north-west, south-west England and the West Midlands. Conditions are expected to remain dry, sunny and very warm for a short time further south and east but it won’t be long before the unsettled conditions take charge across the whole of the country. By tomorrow it will be fresher everywhere with broken cloud and some sunshine, but further rain will reach western and northern areas during the day. Rain will edge across the rest of the UK during the night to leave a day of sunshine and scattered showers on Thursday. It will then become more changeable, with the north and west likely to see strong winds and spells of rain or showers at times, whilst the east has the best of the drier and brighter spells.

(Image: Getty Images)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFrom my bedroom window in Railway Terrace I could see the pride of the North Midland company: Normanton station, opened in 1840. It was approached by a covered bridge, leading down a wide staircase to a spacious booking hall. The broad, sweeping platforms a quarter of a mile long could take 18-coach trains. The waiting room had a cheery coal fire, and there were always porters to help passengers. There were ornate refreshment rooms. Normanton station was a Victorian marvel. And now gone, all gone, except for a short section of platform and a bus-stop shelter for the infrequent stoppers to Leeds. The buildings were demolished, post-Beeching. No more Thames-Clyde expresses, or “all stations to Manchester Victoria”.  The station was once the heart and soul of a community, a place of bustle, business, comings and goings to far-off places. Of romance, even. It was no coincidence that Brief Encounter, that most English of romantic movies, was filmed around a station, Carnforth, where Scots flyers thundered through. Today’s stations are either soulless halts or shopping centres from which trains are reluctantly permitted to depart. They bear testimony to the age of coffee shop chains and fashion boutiques. Perhaps this is what travellers want. A Transport Focus survey makes revamped Birmingham New Street the third-best station in the country – the final triumph of retail over railway. There are dozens of shops selling things I don’t want to buy, but the trains still go from cramped, chilly, underground platforms with nowhere to sit and bewildered passengers milling about trying to find escape routes. Kings Cross in London was the most-liked. It may be an architectural masterpiece, but it’s junk if you are on a journey. Not enough seats, and crowds staring miserably at a monster departure board that barely gives you enough time to catch your train.  Maybe that’s because privatised operators are in cahoots with retailers to keep us herded into the shopping precinct. St Pancras is rated second-best. Have you ever tried getting through the wheelie-suitcase warriors there? Lucky to escape with no more than a bruised shin. And don’t try to find the local services. They are in another place altogether, with fewer shops because commuters don’t have time to buy the chainstore rubbish on sale to Eurostar travellers. Give me an honest-to-goodness station where the trains are more important than “the retail experience”. A station like Grade 1-listed Huddersfield, whose classical facade makes the proudest architectural statement on the system.  It has two pubs, proper boozers with proper beer and railway paintings on the wall and drinkers who look as if they might be going to Newcastle (another great station). And there is a station cat. Stations are – or should be – places of glamour. I like to land in magnificent Bristol Temple Meads knowing I could go to Bodmin, Dawlish, Abergavenny, Ludlow, Haverfordwest or Great Malvern. But not Cardiff, which is not the station of a nation. Or back to bloody New Street. Or Derby – characterless despite a makeover. No, give me the great shambles that is Preston. Or Hull Paragon, which just about manages to retain some of the virtues from which it takes its name. Or Glasgow Central, a real terminus, the end of the line from England - now the only one since the closure of Buchanan Street and St Enoch (the site of a huge shopping centre: an honest transformation, at least).

He used it for 15 years until a house move in 1977 meant he had to put it in storage - and it has remained there ever since.  He has now decided it time to sell the two-seater on and has consigned it for sale with auctioneers Bonhams. Its original paintwork has long faded and peeled away, there are large patches of rust on the front and rear and the interior is wrecked. But because of its lack of use the Aston has only racked up 22,000 miles on the clock and surprisingly the original engine has lasted remarkable well.
