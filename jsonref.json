To Andre, of course, they always were.The plan was to create a family of orphans and rescued apes, one that might eventually be large and cohesive enough to be released back into the wild. But two of the newcomers did not survive and Ndakasi in particular showed no sign of ever wanting to leave her human parent.Her diet had expanded to include carrots and other vegetables but she was incapable of foraging for herself. Worse than that, she still expected to be carried by Andre . . . and she soon weighed over 110lb.\u0027She\u0027s a big strong girl,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027When she climbs on my back, every time I\u0027m worried that I\u0027m going to hurt myself. At the end of the day I have real backache.\u0027Ndakasi and her friends also discovered a game every human child loves — hide and seek. They would break out of the enclosure and gleefully evade capture for hours — until Andre found a secret weapon to outwit them. Young gorillas, it seems, love Pringles crisps. They can\u0027t resist them. And Ndakasi always came back when some salty snacks were on offer.\u0027We do not give it to them as food,\u0027 Andre said, \u0027but rather as a tactic to control them.\u0027Ndakasi didn\u0027t know it but she was an ambassador for her species. As her selfie was reposted millions of times, the sanctuary gained worldwide fame and tourists began coming to Virunga in greater numbers, especially to see the gorillas. One estimate suggested that each gorilla could generate about £2.5 million in income from tourism.Slowly, the militia groups began to understand the value of these rare and extraordinary apes.Numbers started to increase, and there are now more than 1,000 — up by a third since Ndakasi was rescued. That will be her legacy. Gorillas can live to be 40 years old in the wild, but Ndakasi\u0027s long-term health was damaged by her terrible ordeal as a baby.When she died in Andre\u0027s arms on September 26, she was just 14.\u0027I am proud to have called Ndakasi my friend,\u0027 Andre said. \u0027It was a privilege to support and care for such a loving creature, especially knowing the trauma Ndakasi suffered at a very young age.

And though, happily, it was a success, she admits it took a big emotional toll. \u0027I think some people think it\u0027s an easy option, but it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 she says. \u0027I found it very difficult.\u0027The couple decided on commercial surrogacy, engaging a clinic in Ukraine offering a highly controlled, contracted service.\u0027We have since met couples who went down the altruistic route, with a family member or a friend carrying their baby, but we didn\u0027t have anyone we could ask.\u0027They travelled to Kiev where Rosanna underwent the egg retrieval process, her eggs were fertilised with Wes\u0027s sperm and an embryo was successfully implanted in the surrogate\u0027s womb.At first, the couple declined to meet their surrogate, but when it reached the point of receiving scan photos and pregnancy updates, Rosanna struggled.\u0027I found it very hard to see her having my pregnancy. I desperately wanted to be her,\u0027 she says.\u0027It was an exciting time — all those positive emotions were there, too — but there was also a lot of envy and worry. Was she getting emotionally attached? I found it hard that I had no control over what she was eating, how safely she was crossing the road . . .\u0027In November 2019, baby Sophia arrived. Rosanna and Wes were in the delivery room, and Rosanna was the first to hold her baby. Everyone wept. \u0027I kept saying thank you to our surrogate,\u0027 she says. \u0027I must have said it 20 times. I will never be able to repay her.\u0027Their relationship has developed since. \u0027We will never be best friends, but, yes, there is a relationship there,\u0027 Rosanna says.She understands people can be squeamish about money changing hands in surrogacy deals, but is pragmatic about their experience.\u0027We know she didn\u0027t just do it for the money. There are other ways of making money. Yes, she had bills to pay, but she already had a daughter of her own and she wanted to give another couple the chance of being parents.\u0027When Sophia was just a few months old, Rosanna asked her surrogate if she would be willing to repeat the process with another of their embryos (several are \u0027on ice\u0027 at the Kiev clinic). She agreed.Now Rosanna wonders if that positive reply made her body \u0027relax\u0027 into a pregnancy. Because it was just at the point where tentative plans were being made for a second baby, via the surrogate, that she herself fell pregnant, and made it to the 11-week stage.\u0027That was the point I thought: \u0027My body hasn\u0027t given up here.\u0027Within weeks of her 15th miscarriage, Rosanna was pregnant again, this time with twins.She half expected this pregnancy to end in miscarriage, too, and becomes emotional talking about the first time they heard a heartbeat. \u0027In all that time, with all the miscarriages, we\u0027d never got to the point of being able to hear one.\u0027That there were two was \u0027almost beyond belief.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: MaxwellsA large majority of voters approve of the decision by President Michael D Higgins to refuse the invitation to attend a religious event in Armagh to mark the centenary of partition and creation of Northern Ireland, today’s latest Ipsos MRBI poll finds. More than two-thirds of respondents to the poll (68 per cent) agreed that the President was “right to decline the invitation”. Just 17 per cent said that he “should have accepted the invitation”, while 15 per cent expressed no opinion.Last month President Higgins turned down an invitation from a group of church leaders to attend the event later this month in Armagh. The churches have insisted that the occasion is not a celebration of partition, but a ceremony to mark and reflect on the events of 100 years ago when partition brought about the founding of Northern Ireland. They stressed the event was to be intended to promote understanding and reconciliation.President’s reservationsBut Mr Higgins, citing fears that the event had become “politicised”, declined the invitation, arousing considerable controversy. Unionist leaders criticised and expressed disappointment at the decision. Queen Elizabeth has also been invited and is expected to attend, while the Government decided yesterday to send the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to represent it at the event.Support for the President’s decision is highest among older age groups, with 74 per cent of those over 50 agreeing with him, against just 54 per cent of those aged 18-24.Supporters of Fine Gael (19 per cent) and Labour (20 per cent) were most likely to say he should have attended the event.Wealthier voters were slightly more likely to support his decision than voters who are less well off.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"what is in and what is out in budget 2022","story":"Last year, Paschal Donohoe and Michael McGrath produced an enormous €17.75 billion budget package, where hard decisions could be put to one side as money was splurged in the face of a crisis.Barring a “rabbit out of a hat” on Tuesday, however, this year’s package is €4.7 billion. Of this, €1 billion is said to be available for new spending and €500 million is for tax measures.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has warned that there will not be “something for everyone in the audience”. With families under pressure with inflation and rising energy costs, senior Government figures have been flagging for weeks that the budget will be focused on tackling the cost of living. So what is known? What is in and what is out in Budget 2022?Income taxes and workIt is widely expected that tax relief will be provided in the form of indexing tax credits and bands to help offset the impact of inflation on people’s take-home pay. Fine Gael has been promising such measures for months. Most of the €500 million for tax measures in the budget is set to be gobbled up by this measure. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has also said there will be efforts to promote remote working. At present, employers can give €3.20 a day tax-free to their employees. Alternatively, workers can claim a proportion of home expenses back themselves. The proposal is to update this system with workers able to defray the cost of utilities against the tax they pay.Climate actionThe latest Ipsos MRBI poll shows higher taxes on fuel are not popular – with 82 per cent opposed. But failing a major deviation from one of the key commitments in the Programme for Government, carbon tax will rise by €7.50 per tonne as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per year. This means an estimated €1.28 extra on a 60 litre tank of petrol and €1.48 more for a full fill of diesel from midnight next Tuesday. Increases in the cost of other fuels like kerosene (900 litre tank up €19.40), natural gas (average annual usage up €16.95), coal (40kg bag up 89c) and peat briquettes (12.5kg bale up 20c) would not kick in until May. The proceeds will be spent to better insulate homes, but also to increase fuel allowances for those most at risk of fuel poverty.Social welfare and pensionsAlmost half of the €1 billion available for new spending could be taken up with welfare increases. As mentioned, the fuel allowance for vulnerable households – worth €28 per week between the end of September and April – should rise. It was increased by €3.50 in last year’s budget. With high energy costs expected this winter, don’t be surprised if the increase is greater this year. A key question is whether or not State pension payments will rise for the first time since 2019. Government backbenchers are calling for increases of €10 per week. When asked, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said: “We have said that if the cost of living has gone up, and the cost of fuel, that’s something we’re certainly taking into consideration.” Some increases are a safe bet, therefore.A full Christmas bonus for people on welfare payments was paid last year including to people in receipt of pandemic unemployment payments. The Government will want to announce this if at all possible, but arguments are still in play.ChildcareThere were no measures to help with childcare costs last year . On Friday Varadkar issued the strongest signal yet that help with the costs could be on the way as he confirmed the issue is being examined as the Budget is being finalised.Earlier this week Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman said he hopes to make changes to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) next year.The levels of subsidies for the universal and mean-tested scheme went untouched for 2021. Changes to the scheme are being examined ahead of the budget as is low pay for staff and the sustainability of the business of childcare providers. An extra two weeks of parental leave is set to be introduced from next August. That will bring the number of weeks a parent of a newborn can take off work – supported by €245 payments from the State – to seven.HousingThe Coalition launched its landmark Housing for All plan just last month. It promised the “largest ever housing budget in the history of the State” with “in excess of €20 billion” to be provided – through exchequer funding, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency – over the next five years. Expect some of that to be stumped up on Tuesday. While applications for the new affordable housing scheme are not due to be open until early next year, the existing help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers purchasing new builds will be extended beyond the end of this year.HealthVaradkar promised earlier this year that the up to €4 billion in extra health spending for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic would be maintained next year. That must have been music to the ears of Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly as he entered budget talks and it would be surprising if the €22 billion allocated last year is not matched, at the very least. With warnings that 500,000 people will be added to healthcare waiting lists before the end of the year and the Sláintecare reforms hitting troubled water the Government will not want to be seen to be taking the foot off the throttle in its support for the health system.Cigarettes and alcoholAny increase on the cost of cigarettes is likely to be minimal if it happens at all. Department of Finance officials have suggested a further hike could be counterproductive and may just encourage smokers to source cigarettes from abroad. The Government is reluctant to increase excise on drink given the pressure on pubs and restaurants during the pandemic.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"pensioners and parents can expect a budget boost","story":"The Tánaiste says he cannot confirm what will or won’t not be included in the budget at this stage as ‘there are still some decisions being made’. Photograph: iStock Measures to help families with the cost of childcare and a €5 increase in the State pension are being considered as Ministers work to finalise the details of the budget. Senior Government figures have long flagged that €1 billion in new spending measures will focus on efforts to counter the rising cost of living. And parents of creche-going children and pensioners are in line to see a boost as part of that strategy. Backbench Coalition TDs have been pressing for enhanced childcare supports and an increase in the State pension, with some suggesting the latter should be increased by as much as €10 a week. The  understands the more likely sum will be €5 a week. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar offered the strongest signal yet that both issues are being examined ahead of Tuesday’s political set piece. Mr Varadkar said he could not confirm what would or would not be included in the budget at this stage as “there are still some decisions being made”. However, he said: “One of the things, of course, we are going to examine in the context of the budget is the cost of childcare. “But it is still the case that for many people, childcare is like paying two mortgages or like having to pay the rent twice every week.” The Tánaiste said from an enterprise and employment point of view, childcare costs were a barrier to people returning to the workplace. “We have skills shortage across the economy and many women, particularly women but not exclusively women, can’t get back into the workplace because of the cost of childcare so it is something that the Government will address in the years ahead,” he said. Sources said childcare was a “top priority” as Ministers work to finalise the budget. SubsidiesUnder the NCS, there are universal subsidies of up to €22.50 a week or higher, means-tested supports for families on lower incomes. Changes to the NCS scheme are being examined as well as the issues of the low pay for staff and the sustainability of childcare providers’ businesses. Earlier this week Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman – speaking in the context of access to childcare for disadvantaged families – said he hoped to introduce changes to the NCS next year. On welfare measures Mr Varadkar said a big part of the additional €1 billion spend “will be taken up by the pensions and welfare package and it needs to be because of the rising cost of living”. “We need to see pensioners and others getting an increase, they haven’t got that since 2019,” he said. “I suppose that means money for other new measures is relatively limited.” Mr Varadkar added: “One of the things we are working towards in the context of the budget is an aviation package, that’s one of the things we need to do to get international tourists back to Ireland. “I think where you will see a big move is on aviation supports, to get those routes back into Shannon, back into Cork and Dublin.” Tuesday’s budget package is expected to amount to €4.7 billion, of which €1 billion is said to be available for new spending and €500 million is for tax measures.Mica redressThe owners of mica-damaged homes will have to wait some weeks longer for details of a proposed redress scheme. Thousands of mica protesters marched through Dublin on Friday demanding a scheme that will cover 100 per cent of their costs. Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed that the redress scheme would not be ready for budget day but would be “shortly after that”. He said there would be “enormous resources” required to deal with the issue that he described as “appalling” for residents and homeowners. “We want to arrive at a comprehensive solution for the homeowners and it will take some weeks to put that together and to work out the implementation of that,” Mr Martin added.

Photograph: Patrick Bolger BloombergA large majority of voters support the payment of a pandemic bonus for frontline workers in the public sector, according to the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.A smaller majority believes the Government should pay a bonus to private sector workers, such as retail workers and taxi drivers.Almost four out of five respondents to the poll (79 per cent) said they were in favour of “paying a pandemic bonus to public sector frontline workers”, with just 18 per cent opposed.Asked if a bonus is to be paid to public sector workers, to whom should it be paid, almost half of all respondents (47 per cent) said it should be paid to “frontline hospital and emergency services workers only”.But 30 per cent of respondents said the bonus should be paid to “all frontline workers in the public sector, including gardaí, teachers and bustrain drivers etc”. Thirteen per cent said it should be paid to “all public sector workers including those who were not public facing or were remote working during the pandemic”. Ten per cent of respondents offered no opinion.Asked if Government should pay a pandemic bonus “to private sector and frontline workers (eg, retail workers, taxi drivers, private hospital workers, etc)”, a slim majority (52 per cent) of respondents agreed. A substantial minority of voters (40 per cent) were opposed.Political controversy The proposal for bonuses has been the subject of considerable political controversy in recent weeks. A number of public sector unions have indicated that if bonuses are being paid, they want their members to be included. Teachers unions first said they wanted to be involved in discussions about a bonus, but later said they were not seeking any payment. Some Government TDs were critical of the plans, which are still under discussion. Meanwhile, despite the decline in public satisfaction with the Government and its leaders in the poll, reported earlier this week in The , a large majority of voters believe the Coalition has done a good job managing the pandemic. Approval ratings for the Government as a whole, for Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar all showed sharp falls since June, while support for Fine Gael dropped by five points.However, almost three-quarters (74 per cent) of respondents to the poll said the Government was “doing a good job in its handling of the pandemic”, with 22 per cent saying it was not doing a good job. Older voters, those in Dublin and wealthier voters were more likely to believe the Government was doing a good job.However, voters are ided on the next steps. Asked “if the country is ready now to remove all restrictions and get back to normal, or are we not yet ready to go back to normal”, a thin majority of respondents (52 per cent) said they favoured a return to normal. However, a substantial minority (44 per cent) said the country was not yet ready.The remaining restrictions are due to be lifted on October 22nd.The poll was conducted among 1,200 adults at 120 sampling points across all constituencies on October 2nd, 4th and 5th.

Drop in supportThe sharp drops in support for Fine Gael and for its leader are the most noticeable aspects of the poll, bringing the party to its lowest levels since the last general election. It comes after a difficult period for the Government, and for Fine Gael in particular which faced sustained criticism for the now-abandoned appointment of former minister Katherine Zappone as a special envoy, and a motion of no-confidence in Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.But the poll results also come after the launch of the National Development Plan earlier this week, which saw the Government pledge to invest €165 billion in capital projects over the next 20 years, and as the pandemic continues to recede.Hopes in the Government parties of a “Covid bounce” have come to nothing, as the political agenda has shifted from managing the pandemic to issues such as health and housing, on which the Government faces severe challenges.The result is the highest ever rating for Sinn Féin in The Ipsos MRBI series. Though the party remains strongest among younger voters and in working class communities, it has also made gains this year among older voters and wealthier voters. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald sees a marginal increase in her satisfaction rating, from 42 to 43 per cent.Fianna Fáil support remains skewed towards older voters, though the party will be happy to have recovered support in Dublin to 16 per cent, twice the level recorded earlier this year.At 7 per cent, the Green Party has recovered to the level of support it won at the last general election, though party leader Eamon Ryan sees his personal approval rating slip by a point to 25 per cent, the lowest of all the party leaders.The poll was conducted among 1,200 adults at 120 sampling points across all constituencies on October 2nd, 4th and 5th.

Photograph: EPAChina’s reunification with Taiwan must happen and will happen peacefully, the country’s leader Xi Jinping said, despite a ratcheting-up of threats to attack the island.Mr Xi spoke on at an official celebration in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People the focused largely on the need for the ruling Communist Party to continue to lead China as the country rises in power and influence.“Reunification of the nation must be realised, and will definitely be realised,” he said.“Reunification through a peaceful manner is the most in line with the overall interest of the Chinese nation, including Taiwan compatriots.”Taiwan called on China to abandon its “provocative steps” and said the future of the island is in the hands of its people.The celebration was in honour of the 110th anniversary of the Chinese revolution in 1911 leading to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and establishment of the Republic of China led by Sun Yat-sen.October 10th is celebrated in Taiwan as National Day and Mr Xi’s address touched on common aspirations for a unified future, despite the stark differences between China’s authoritarian one-party system and Taiwan’s vibrant multi-party democracy.Mr Xi’s remarks came just days after the Chinese military sent a record number of military aircraft flying towards Taiwan in exercises that the self-ruled island has called a threat.Over the course of four days, starting last week, the People’s Liberation Army flew fighter jets, bombers and airborne early warning aircraft 149 times towards Taiwan, with the largest manoeuvre involving 52 jets at once.Taiwan and China split in 1949 amid civil war, with the then ruling Nationalist Party fleeing to the island as Mao Zedong’s Communists swept to power on the mainland.Since then, Taiwan has been self-ruled, but its sovereignty is denied by Beijing, which has refused to renounce the option of using force to bring the island under its control.Beijing has also sought to isolate Taiwan internationally by barring it from the United Nations and other international organisations and opposing official contacts between its government and nations that recognise China, especially the United States, which is legally bound to consider threats against Taipei a matter of “grave concern”.“Taiwanese separatism is the biggest obstacle to the motherland’s reunification,” Mr Xi added, saying those who advocated for independence would be “condemned by history”.Taiwan’s presidential office said on Saturday that the future of the island rests in the hands of its people and that mainstream public opinion is very clear in rejecting China’s “one country, two systems” model.Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council in a separate statement called on China to abandon its “provocative steps of intrusion, harassment and destruction”. – AgenciesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"us and taliban leaders to discuss evacuees from afghanistan","story":"A woman in a camp for internally displaced people in Kabul, Afghanistan, on September 29th. Photograph: Jim HuylebroekThe New York TimesUS officials will meet with senior Taliban leaders for talks aimed at easing the evacuations of foreign citizens and at-risk Afghans from Afghanistan, a US official has said.The focus of talks in Doha, Qatar, would be holding Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders to commitments that they would allow Americans and other foreign nationals to leave Afghanistan.These commitments also extended to Afghans who once worked for the US military or government and other Afghan allies, the official said.The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak about the meetings.The Taliban meeting will be first senior face-to-face talks since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.The Biden administration has fielded questions and complaints about the slow pace of US-facilitated evacuations from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan since the last US forces and diplomats left the country at the end of August.State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Thursday that 105 US citizens and 95 green-card holders had left since then on flights facilitated by the US, with that number having not changed for more than a week.US veterans and other iniduals have helped others leave the country on charter flights, and some Americans and others have left across land borders.That leaves dozens of American citizens still seeking to get out, according to the State Department, along with thousands of green-card holders and Afghans and family members believed eligible for US visas.US officials have cited the difficulty of verifying flight manifests without any American officials on the ground in Afghanistan to help, along with other hold-ups.Americans also intend to press the Taliban to observe the rights of women and girls, many of whom the Taliban are reportedly blocking from returning to jobs and classrooms, and of Afghans at large, and to form an inclusive government, the official said.US officials will also encourage Taliban officials to give humanitarian agencies free access to areas in need amid the economic upheaval following the US departure and Taliban takeover.The official stressed the session did not imply the US was recognising the Taliban as legitimate governors of the country.Islamic State attackMeanwhile, Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a Shia Muslim mosque in northern Afghanistan that killed at least 46 people and wounded dozens.The claim, carried by the IS-linked Aamaq news agency and cited by the Site Intelligence Group — which monitors militant postings, came just hours after the blast tore through the packed mosque in the city of Kunduz.The attack was the latest in a series of IS bombings and shootings that have targeted Afghanistan’s new Taliban rulers, as well as religious institutions and members of the country’s minority Shia.The explosion tore through the mosque during noon prayers, the highlight of the Muslim religious week. It blew out windows, charred the ceiling and scattered debris and twisted metal across the floor.The worshippers were Hazaras, who have long suffered from double discrimination as an ethnic minority and as followers of Shia Islam in a majority Sunni country.IS has been behind a rise in attacks, including against the Taliban, since the departure of US and Nato forces from Afghanistan at the end of August.IS and the Taliban, who seized control of the country with the exit of the foreign troops, are strategic rivals. IS militants have targeted Taliban positions and attempted to recruit members from their ranks.In the past, the Taliban managed to contain the IS threat in tandem with US and Afghan air strikes. Without these, it remains unclear whether the Taliban can suppress what appears to be a growing IS footprint.The militants, once confined to the east, have penetrated the capital of Kabul and other provinces with new attacks. – AgenciesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Fears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"can tories afford not nasty","story":"With the benefit of hindsight, Angela Rayner probably wouldn’t have described Tories as “scum”. Not just because it reaffirmed the deputy Labour leader’s cloddish credentials, nor even that Sir Iain Duncan Smith was afterwards attacked with a traffic cone by some of her knuckleheaded supporters.No, what must really grate for Ms Rayner is that what was originally intended as a slur to galvanise the support of foaming-at-the-mouth Labour activists has actually done the opposite and brought the Conservatives together.I was struck by how many delegates in Manchester this week were literally wearing the insult as a badge of honour. After ConservativeHome chief executive Mark Wallace tweeted that he had an “exclusive supply of “Tory scum” badges, Dehenna Davison, the Tory MP for Bishop Auckland, led the stampede. If Conservative Campaign Headquarters had any sense, they’d be firing up the production line on a new range of T-shirts, mugs and tea towels as we speak.Like the Vermin Club of the 1940s, accidentally formed by Right-wingers after Aneurin Bevan described Tories as “lower than vermin”, Conservatives are rightly embracing their scum status. Of course, being called Tory scum is nothing new, but the reaction to it has changed as dramatically as the face – and demographic – of the party.While it may have been an appropriate obloquy to lob at the likes of Alan B’Stard or Harry Enfield’s Tory Boy, as the daughter of a stonemason who grew up on a Sheffield council estate, MPs like Ms Davison don’t wear it quite as well. And neither did James Brokenshire, the former secretary of state for Northern Ireland and for communities and local government who died of lung cancer on Thursday, aged 53.Described by all who met him as a thoroughly decent, unfailingly polite and hugely dedicated man in politics for all the right reasons, the mild-mannered father-of-three could not be further from the “scum” brush with which Rayner has tried to tar all Tories. Again displaying her trademark brass, even she was forced to admit that “he cared deeply about his work and public service” in a rare straying from the shallow end of her cerebral cortex.The ugly truth for the Opposition is that the Tories no longer resemble anything close to the “nasty party” Mrs May warned about in 2002.By 1997 and after 18 years of Tory rule, the Conservatives had acquired such a bad reputation that even William Hague was forced to admit in his first speech to the Tory party conference as its leader that the party had become “ided, arrogant, selfish and conceited ... out of touch and irrelevant”.When the former Prime Minister, then party chairman, made her controversial remark five years later, she was not only referring to old-fashioned views on social issues like gay marriage but also a perception that the Tories expected the poor to digest paving slabs.Fast forward nearly 20 years and we now have Boris Johnson’s wife, Carrie, admitting she has been “moved to tears” over LGBT hate and the big-spending Prime Minister facing criticism for doing too much to help those hit hardest by the pandemic. Having agreed to a 1.25 per cent increase in National Insurance to claw back the multi-billion-pound cost of Covid, Mr Johnson has managed to reposition the Tories as the “party of the NHS” (if not low taxes).So while some in the party may decry the destruction of Thatcher’s anti-tax and spend economics, at least the milk-snatcher side of her legacy appears to have finally been expunged.The only question that remains is, at what cost? Some of the most interesting polling to have come out of conference was Opinium’s survey about the electoral centre ground for the Social Market Foundation think tank. As well as revealing that Conservatives had grown much more worried about inequality, the survey found that fewer Tories were now in favour of cutting red tape on business.Showing a significant shift in attitudes on economic issues, the polling found that in 2016, some 48 per cent of Conservative voters said that government should “make it as easy as possible to run a business by removing regulations and rules.”. Now only 27 per cent of Tories support that position.Meanwhile, the percentage of Tories who say that business will find a way to make money despite government interventions has risen from 26 per cent to 34 per cent.Five years ago, more than three- quarters (78 per cent) of Tories said that “people should be able to earn whatever they want as long as they pay the amount of tax they legally owe.”. Now, that is down to 55 per cent, with more than a quarter (28 per cent) arguing that society must not become “too unequal” as the “super rich live in a different world to the underclass”. (In 2016, just 15 per cent of Tories were worried about inequality).While Mr Johnson’s new “heir to Blair” centrist offering may well be in tune with an electorate that has moved Leftwards on economic questions, he ignores the concerns faced by businesses – big and small – at his peril. As former US President Calvin Coolidge put it: “Don’t expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.”What we witnessed from the Conservatives this week was a rather anti-business offering, with Cabinet ministers seemingly lining up to blame the recent shortages on firms’ failure to prepare for Brexit. Accusing businesses of being “drunk on cheap labour”, one senior source insisted it was “a failure of the free market, not the state” that was behind the fuel crisis and empty shelves.Yet the plain truth here is that the Government had been warned months ago about the shortage of lorry drivers behind the current problems, and should have determined that sufficient drivers would be allowed into the country from abroad to fill the gaps. While the appointment of ex-Tesco CEO Sir David Lewis as the Government’s new supply chain adviser is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, that role should have been filled the day we left the EU.Moreover, it should have ensured that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) – the government body responsible for granting HGV licences – wasn’t sitting on 54,000 unprocessed applications. Since we managed to get a national newspaper out every day of lockdown, what on earth is the DVLA’s excuse for not doing the job taxpayers subsidise? Had someone in Government got, dare I say it, “nastier” with this arms-length organisation then perhaps we wouldn’t be in quite such a mess. It was the same with Public Health England’s shambolic handling of the PPE (personal protective equipment) crisis at the start of the pandemic, which was greeted with a pathetic sort of pandering rather than a properly punchy response.It strikes me as rather contradictory for Mr Johnson to praise the “capitalist energy” behind the vaccine rollout while failing to apply the same no-compromise, private-sector thinking to some of our public bodies that are unfit for purpose.Currently, the only person in Government who is actively seeking to “level up” businesses with a deregulatory Brexit idend is Lord Frost. Armed with the report released in May by Duncan Smith’s Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform, “Frosty” appears to be taking no prisoners when it comes to the Northern Ireland protocol as well as the ergence from EU rules that the 52 per cent voted for in 2016. Refreshingly, this straight-talking former diplomat isn’t trying to win a popularity contest either – unlike almost all of his Cabinet colleagues.No one wants to see a return of the nasty party. But if the Tories lose their teeth, not least when it comes to competence in a crisis, then they are in danger of biting the dust.More from News‘If we stop the generators, our babies die’: Lebanon on life supportMadeleine McCann: Prosecutors \u0026#39100pc certain\u0026#39 they have killer in custodyEric Zemmour leads French Eurosceptic vote as far-Right provocateur weighs in on Poland-EU spat\u0026#39No one should underestimate our determination\u0026#39: China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping vows \u0026#39reunification\u0026#39 with TaiwanIt was jam tomorrow at the Tory party conference, at least according to Liz TrussRebuilding education has to be about more than gradesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"former editor radio 4s today show wanted move thought day newsnight","story":"The former editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme wanted to get rid of Thought for the Day and move it to Newsnight, she has admitted.Sarah Sands, who stepped down last year, said she was talked out of the idea by Sir Richard Eyre, the theatre director and BBC governor, who told her it would cause a scandal and be debated in Parliament.“Thought for the Day is a very peculiar moment in a news programme and when I first arrived at the Today programme I said, ‘Give it to Newsnight, put it somewhere else.’ But it’s absolutely, constitutionally there.

The slot is governed by the BBC’s religion department.Her other complaint was that Thought for the Day “has no relation to the rest of the programme.

We like, what do you call it, capitalism.”  George, from Devon, added: “We’re not anti-anything, like all the artists normally are.”In 2017, the artists, who met at St Martin’s School of Art in London in 1967, said Tate never showed their work and never would “because nothing is good enough for them”. The Tate pointed out at the time that the 2007 Gilbert and George retrospective hosted at the Tate Modern was the “largest exhibition ever to be mounted of their art at that time”.Yet Gilbert insisted that it was only because they had mounted a long campaign and “twisted their arms”.“We were never invited. We are never invited to do anything. We always propose it, in Britain especially,” he said.Similarly, they have previously complained that Tate Modern has not shown a single picture of them for a decade or more.The pair, famed for their formal appearance, have lived together in east London since 1968 and often speak of their support for the Tories and Brexit.On their art, they knew as students that they stood apart from their contemporaries.Gilbert added: “They all have formalism - forms - and we never had that, from the first day. We only have . . . the humanism of a person, the centre of our art is that. “The inidual today, how he walks through life.

They elect candidates who make claims far more grandiose and sweeping than non-French politicians would dare. And then, when the same politician makes a tiny adjustment to the retirement age, for instance, the French public come out onto the streets and shortly afterwards turf their revolutionary of choice out of office.President Macron is proving a fine example. When he rose to prominence in 2016-17, he was the epitome of the outsider-insider candidate. He may have had the right educational background, but he didn’t even have a party, let alone a set of candidates, until he was well on the way to being anointed President of the Republic.Yet four years on, Macron has been a stable but unremarkable president. The economic and societal problems that France faced before his tenure are as present now as they were then. And as the opportunity to return to the ballot box comes around again in 2022, the French public are once more looking for an available revolutionary to kick the previous one in the traditional indelicate manner.At this exact point, for the past four decades, the exact same story has played out. That is the ogreish story of the Le Pen family.In the 1980s, when President Mitterand needed to split the French Right to remain in office, he actually enabled Jean-Marie Le Pen to look like a serious candidate for the presidency. Not least by making him part of the television debates and cynically sending Le Pen’s ratings soaring.It was an artful if disgraceful move. Certainly, part of the French public liked Le Pen’s Vichy-ite talk, but a larger portion on the Right was put off by it and by everything that Jean-Marie stood for. It is the tragedy of the French Right that Le Pen and his family have continued to be a presence in every election since then.Because each election cycle, the story is the same. The other candidates take into account the Le Pen candidate (nowadays Jean-Marie’s less radical daughter Marine) and spend part of their time trying to subsume and imitate certain of their concerns. Then they warn the country of the dangers of going anywhere near the Le Pen dynasty.Each time, it works. The foreign press gets excited about the prospect of a serious upset in French politics. But the taint of the Le Pens is such that the public will never vote in significant enough numbers to allow one of them into the office of the president.This time, however, it seems possible that the Le Pen family’s disastrous hold on a portion of the French Right may finally be slipping. An alternative has emerged. The author and commentator Eric Zemmour has not even announced his candidacy yet. But already the polls show that if he does run, he will effectively kill off Marine Le Pen as a serious candidate.Polls show her support falling by more than 10 per cent in only a few months, while other candidates of the French centre-Right languish far behind her. Were Zemmour to run, it looks possible that he could go through to the final round as the candidate to stand off against President Macron. That is assuming that Macron himself manages to make it through. Here, certainly, would be a revolution.Zemmour himself is not well known to English readers. Some of his views would be considered seriously radical in British politics. But in France he is a phenomenon. The Jewish son of French-Algerian parents, he spent most of his career as a respected mainstream writer on politics. Then in the past decade or more, he suddenly became a pariah among everyone except a significant proportion of the French public.In a string of books, notably Le Suicide Francais (2014), Zemmour has sought to shatter the consensus of the Parisian intellectual and journalistic class. He wrote about subjects that the public cared about deeply, but which were skated around by France’s intellectual elite. Quite something, given that France’s intellectual class is infinitely braver than our own (to the extent that we have one).French intellectuals and writers have not shied away from the troubling questions of mass immigration, Islamism and more. But it was Zemmour who said many things that the public had not previously dared. He called for halts on immigration, controversially lamented the demographic alteration of the French population, and called for direct measures to counter these changes.His books have sold in their hundreds of thousands. But the price he paid was among his peers. Only recently he lost his job presenting a popular television show for reasons spuriously invented and applied solely to him. He has frequently been taken to court for “hate speech”. Other journalists call him every predictable name. Yet with each assault Zemmour has not just survived but grown.Today he is a celebrity in France. Paris Match recently put him on their front cover because of a photo snatched of him in the sea bathing with his attractive young female assistant. It is a scenario unimaginable in Britain. To even approximate it you would have to imagine Mary Beard papped on the front of Hello magazine with a new squeeze, while considering a run for No 10.So can Zemmour do it? The polls currently suggest that he could. Macron’s ratings have slumped, and though it is likely he will make the final round of the presidential election it is not certain that he will. Meanwhile, other candidates of the French Right are not only lagging in the polls but also have the distinct disadvantage of saying things now that Zemmour said in far stronger terms many years ago.For instance Michel Barnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, is hoping to be the candidate of the French Right. To make himself viable, he has spent recent months calling for a moratorium on all immigration into France for five years. Why would the public vote for this watered-down Right-wingery?Until now the answer was “because you have no other choice. It is either this or the Le Pens. And do you really want them?” But now a candidate has come along who says similar things to what Marine Le Pen says, though with much greater flair and knowledge. And for the first time it seems as though the French Right might have a viable candidate to stand before the public next April without the taint of the Le Pen family dynasty.Will it work? Who knows. Much of the commentariat is getting ahead of itself in France. And by not yet announcing, Zemmour is playing a clever media game of his own. If he did run, he would have to at least consider creating a serious party structure beneath him. Yet that is what Macron did after coming from nowhere before the last election.All that is certain is that if Zemmour even made it through, it would be a political earthquake. Not just in France but across Europe. The EU has survived in recent decades on a technocratic class that occasionally registers deep public concerns, but does little or nothing to address them.Zemmour does not follow in that tradition. With his dislike of the European Union, hatred of the status quo and belief that France can reassert itself as a sovereign power, the French public may go to the polls next time with a chance for serious change. Whether they vote for it, or accept it if they do, will of course be another matter entirely.Douglas Murray is the author of ‘The Madness of Crowds’.

Now, it appears, Kate could be making her way to a small screen near you.Hot on the heels of her husband’s Earthshot Prize documentary, the Duchess of Cambridge has been in talks with documentary makers as part of her research into childhood development. A note in the court circular this week reveals she spoke “via telephone” to David Glover, the co-founder of 72 Films who has made programmes for Channel 4 and worked with the late scientist Stephen Hawking.My sources at the Palace tell me the talks were preliminary and for research purposes. Royal watchers expect any new film to be about the importance of the first five years of a child’s life on their outcomes – an area the Duchess has devoted herself to. But with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex  cooking up a range of shows for Netflix in California and being trailed around New York by television cameras, perhaps Kate might be a bit more daring?When he was at Channel 4, Glover commissioned Gogglebox. A Royal Special featuring the Windsors would certainly be must-watch TV.The Prime Minister must be a glutton for punishment. Andrew Gimson, who penned the original and best account of Boris Johnson’s life, has been signed up by Simon \u0026amp Schuster for an entirely new second volume.And the biographer says that Johnson has already offered to help where he can with the second tome, which will cover his years in government from 2016 to the present day.The PM wasn’t always so supportive. In fact he was so nervous about Gimson’s first book – “The rise of Boris Johnson’’ – that he offered him £100,000 not to write it.Gimson tells me his new work “will shed light on this much misunderstood and usually underestimated figure,” adding: “I will not sell out for less than £1 million.”Tory delegates marvelled at a streamlined Brandon Lewis at this week’s party conference in Manchester. The exercise-mad Northern Ireland secretary has shed two stone after cutting out chocolate and junk food.None of which has been easy, particularly because his father ran a confectionery business while young Brandon was growing up.Whatever next for the regulars sipping their pints of Shires ale in the Bull? Simon Williams, the actor who plays “toff” Justin Elliott in The Archers, has suggested his character in the Ambridge soap might come out as transgender.Fans of the show have long complained that the BBC’s ham-fisted efforts to “modernise” the world’s longest-running drama by using it as a showcase for right-on causes are no laughing matter.Rachel Johnson is clearly growing into her role as First Sister. First she sat next to her sister in law Carrie during her brother’s party conference speech. Now it has emerged that she has her own luggage which looks suspiciously like a ministerial red box.#The “red box” – which was not a present from brother Boris – is a £955 “carry on case” from British luxury luggage maker Globetrotter, which claims to have supplied cases to the Queen and Winston Churchill, monogrammed with her initials in gold.I did choose the colour,” she admits. Perfect for weekends away at Chequers.Speaking of weekends away, the ongoing spat between Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab over the right to use the grace and favour Chevening mansion is getting wearisome.The Chevening Estate Act of 1959 states that the Prime Minister has to decide the “nominated person” to occupy the 17th century stately home. But James Cleverly, Truss’s number two at the Foreign Office, thinks he may have a solution: why not make all grace and favour properties only available to ministers who use them to drum up business for the UK?This may well give Truss, with her experience of winning deals as foreign trade secretary, an advantage over Raab – but it’s a risky suggestion.

Amid a forest of exhibition stands in the Conservative Party conference hall, the Prime Minister mounted a bicycle and started pedalling.He had dropped by to promote his target of making the UK “net zero” in carbon emissions by 2050, press pack in tow, but had spotted the chance for some mischief. As he sped away across the Tory Blue carpet, photographers scrambled to take their shots in time, hollering at him to come back. Delegates chuckled and reached for their iPhones or did double-takes. Downing Street aides, nerves evident behind smiles, tried to keep across the commotion.As for the man at the centre, one camera captured some telling audio. Navigating the crowds as the laughter rang out, he was heard muttering to himself: “Where are we going?” The scene somehow captured the mood of this year’s party gathering in Manchester, four days of handshakes and speeches – both the triumph and the uncertainty.More than two years into office and despite the tremors of Covid and fuel crises, the Prime Minister still has the Tory faithful smiling and clapping along at the show. His leadership is unchallenged. His party sits pretty in the polls. The meaning of Toryism is being refashioned in Johnson’s own image and Britain’s political centre ground redefined.But look closer and a creeping sense of unease can be found in the party, from the Cabinet down, about the months ahead and the durability of the Johnson magic. How long before the Government gets the blame for shortages and the cost of living crunch? Will the reach for the Red Wall seats leave the South disillusioned? And how, exactly, do traditional Tory values fit with this new “radical and optimistic Conservatism”?Johnson will keep pedalling and keep them smiling, but perhaps storm clouds are gathering. Weathering what is coming to reach the desired destination is easier said than done.When the Prime Minister arrived at the Edwardian red brick Midland Hotel in the pouring rain of Saturday night he had reason to be content about his political standing. Autumn had brought with it the kind of overlapping real world problems that in normal times would lead to a nose e in support for the governing party.A full-blown petrol crisis was playing out across the country, with scores of forecourts closed, queues snaking into the distance and anecdotal reports of fights breaking out. The problem was one of delivery, not supply – the lack of HGV drivers to pick up fuel and fill the pumps – but the result was the same: millions of people struggling to fill up their cars.Energy bills had also just shot up, an increase of £139 in the price cap announced the day before Johnson reached Manchester, a product of a global gas shortage. That all coincided with the Treasury calling time on the furlough scheme, a VAT holiday for hospitality and a £20 Universal Credit uplift benefiting six million people – a further squeeze.Yet even a brief scan of the opinion polls as Tory members gathered showed no evidence that the public mood was shifting away from the Conservatives.“He is one of those rare politicians like Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan,” enthused one Cabinet minister over drinks. “He has that special quality.”Similar sentiments were voiced by more front-benchers in Manchester – that, for reasons they might not fully understand, the Prime Minister really does have a connection with voters that other politicians do not.It is not just Tories who accept the point. Multiple shadow Cabinet ministers had admitted the same when Labour gathered for its conference in Brighton the week before. Sir Keir Starmer, they said privately, may have detoxified the party but lacked the pizzazz and “optimism” of the Prime Minister. One even said they would bet their house on a Tory victory at the next election – a remarkable admission.The comfort the Tory leadership felt in its political position was clear in the approach to this week. It was a “putting meat on the bones” conference, one senior Tory said. No change of direction or major reboot was needed, it was felt by Downing Street. The messaging was right, they just needed to remind voters they were still on track – hence the “getting on with the job” conference slogan, which signalled past promises would be delivered with the pandemic eased. Hence, too, the lack of big policy announcements.There was, however, one critical change in messaging rolled out at the gathering. It was deliberate and it was opportunistic. The Prime Minister had started writing his conference speech in mid-September when flying to America for a diplomatic blitz that included the United Nations and the White House. He has joked privately that he wrote 6,000 words on the flight, most of it “unusable”. But he had been pondering a challenge that looked set to intensify in the coming months.Brexit and Covid had exacerbated labour shortages in certain sectors, causing supply chain issues – the lack of HGV drivers being one prominent example, the lack of butchers another. Signs of shortages on the supermarket shelves made headlines in September and there were fears – not knocked back publicly by the Cabinet – of problems stretching to Christmas.To navigate the terrain, the Prime Minister latched onto another quirk of the Covid economy – soaring wages, which jumped eight per cent as lockdown eased – to tilt the narrative his way. On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, he unveiled the positioning, championing a “high wages, high skills” economy and refusing to pull “the big lever marked uncontrolled immigration”. Reshuffling his hand, the Prime Minister had somehow flipped a political headache – petrol queues due to the lack of lorry drivers – into a potential strength: standing up for British workers. He doubled down throughout the week, arguing that the onus was on businesses to improve wages and conditions to attract British workers to sign up for the jobs. He argued it was the lorry driving industry and not the State that had so let down HGV drivers that they had to “urinate in bushes” due to a lack of decent truck stops.The politics worked on two fronts. First, it was drawing a new iding line with Labour on immigration after Starmer suggested he would approve 100,000 new visas for foreign lorry drivers to solve the shortage. The move was taken with both eyes firmly on the Red Wall seats of traditional Labour support in the north of England which Johnson flipped in the 2019 election. Many of those constituencies had backed Brexit, which ended free movement of labour from Europe.But it also allowed the Prime Minister to own the surge in wages as a form of Brexit idend – proof that people were getting paid more now they had “taken back control” of immigration, as he had argued when leading the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum.The new framing may have been stumbled upon, but that did not alone make it any less potent. Margaret Thatcher\u0027s privatisation drive – a key part of her legacy of rolling back the reach of the State – is remembered by some as being triggered by the need to raise cash fast for the Treasury.In public, Johnson’s Cabinet was supportive, hammering home the same “high wages, high skills” message despite blowback from business bosses who felt they were being blamed unfairly for shortages. But in private, there is nervousness in some quarters. Much of it revolves around the I-word: inflation. Lost in the nuance of the Prime Minister’s public arguments – but not by some of his colleagues – is that while wages are rising, so too are prices. Both reflect an economy coming out of Covid-induced lockdown, with people spending money they had been saving when stuck at home.But if price rises outstrip wage growth, as some economists predict is about to happen, the win Johnson is declaring could disintegrate upon inspection. One Cabinet minister, unprompted, this week named inflation as their biggest current concern. “We don’t want to go back to the 1970s,” they said.Others warned that unless productivity rises with wages then inflation could run away from the Government and become a major economic and political headache next year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pointed to analysis by multiple central banks, suggesting the price surge is a temporary side-effect of lockdowns ending worldwide. But he is nervous about Britain’s ballooning borrowing.Sunak warned back in his March Budget that just a one per cent increase in inflation and interest rates would cost the UK Government £25 billion in borrowing costs. Since then, the possibility of that becoming reality has increased. It is one reason why the Treasury will be cautious about announcing a major increase in the minimum wage – a point of speculation throughout the Tory conference – at the Budget on October 27.A rise of some form is almost certain, given chancellors always tend to approve the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission, which submits its proposals later this month. The £8.72 national living wage could rise to above £9.42 from next April. But adopting the £15 minimum wage level called for by Labour’s Left wing and resisted by Sir Keir is not being considered by Number 11, which appears more trepidatious about fuelling inflation than the occupant of Number 10.That such an idea was even considered a possibility in the bubble is a reminder of how far Johnson has refashioned the Tory Party in his bid to minimise political space for Starmer, now well into his second year as Labour leader. But here, again, there is deep nervousness from the Tory top rank, in particular around one issue that was the elephant in the room throughout the conference: tax rises.The nuts and bolts of the Tory discomfort are by now familiar. The Prime Minister broke a manifesto pledge last month by raising National Insurance by 1.25p to pay for higher NHS spending and social care reforms. The move pushed the tax burden to its highest point since the post-Second World War years. It followed increases in corporation tax and the freezing of income tax thresholds in the spring and triggered hand-wringing and soul-searching among the Tory grassroots.The same, it emerged during the conference, is true around the Cabinet table. When any Cabinet minister was asked in private this week whether they wanted the tax burden – defined as total taxes and contributions as a proportion of GDP – to fall before the next election, they nodded approval.“Oh God, yes,” said one. “Ideally,” said two others. “We believe in trusting people with their money, not the State,” said a fourth. A fifth revealed their deep “discomfort” at the tax hikes and suggested they would leave the Cabinet after delivering their policy priorities – an eye-catching if, for now, unprovable claim.The message from the centre is one of comfort: don’t worry, it will all be fine. Tory rebels are told tax cuts will come before the next election, expected in May 2024, but details are not forthcoming about when or how.Concern about the political impact of raising taxes is not confined to the Cabinet table. Senior Tories looking ahead to the next election assess that by reaching for the centre ground, Johnson has left political space to his right. Between 15 and 20 seats in traditional Tory strongholds in the rural South, dubbed the Blue Wall, have been flagged by Tory high command as constituencies at risk of being lost when the next vote takes place. They include seats around Cambridge and Oxford as well as Esher and Walton, the constituency of Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary. The party nervousness explains why planning reforms have been scaled back.For now there is no rabble-rouser on the Right who has the cut-through to mount a challenge from that wing. Nigel Farage is in political retirement and looks set to stay there, while others trying to repeat his model have fallen short. Nor are the Liberal Democrats, now unashamedly targeting the Blue Wall and mobilising on the ground, riding high enough in the polls to suggest a major comeback after their shock victory in Tory-held Chesham and Amersham at a by-election in June. But the vulnerability is there and Conservative Campaign Headquarters knows it.Come 11.30am on Wednesday when Johnson strode onto the stage to the whoops and applause of the party masses, he could look back on a smooth four days. There had been no unexpected controversy, no political rival overshadowing from the fringes – a role he had played with relish during David Cameron and Theresa May’s premierships.Cabinet ministers had given their speeches in a smaller than usual auditorium. For the Prime Minister – the only person to use the bigger venue – they sat in a line, positions pre-decided by the party command, and grinned. The 45-minute address had all the colour and comedy that are hallmarks of a Johnson conference speech. Sir Keir was a “rattled bus conductor”, nightclubbing Michael Gove was “Jon Bon Govi”. The Build Back Better slogan became Build Back Burger (celebrating America dropping its UK beef import ban) or Build Ban Beaver (a nod to rewilding).Talking later, a Downing Street source said the Prime Minister had been practising the speech in his hotel room in the evenings but – quelle surprise – no jokes had been left on the cutting room floor.But just as he had done as a columnist, Johnson’s humour is often used to cloak hard political points – in this case, pushing ahead with his bold reworking of the Tory Party brand. He was steadfast against mass immigration, zealous on culture wars, fulsome in praise for the NHS and condemnatory for eco-protesters.At times Prime Minister can ride two horses at once, at points framing himself as the heir to Blair and at others as the keeper of the Maggie flame. Both got a showing on Wednesday. He irks at comparisons with Donald Trump, often for good reason. But there is at least one similarity – both men challenged orthodoxies in their political parties and remoulded them in their own image, redefining the political landscape as a result.The Prime Minister left Manchester all powerful in party politics, the cheers ringing in his ears but knowing a fraught road lies ahead. He will keep pedalling, with the wind at his back – for now at least.More from News‘If we stop the generators, our babies die’: Lebanon on life supportMadeleine McCann: Prosecutors \u0026#39100pc certain\u0026#39 they have killer in custodyEric Zemmour leads French Eurosceptic vote as far-Right provocateur weighs in on Poland-EU spat\u0026#39No one should underestimate our determination\u0026#39: China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping vows \u0026#39reunification\u0026#39 with TaiwanIt was jam tomorrow at the Tory party conference, at least according to Liz TrussRebuilding education has to be about more than gradesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan could make surprise","story":":root Harry and Meghan could make surpriseto UK for Diana event, source saysPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are weighing up whether to attend - and bring Archie and Lilibet - to the Princess Diana statue event at Kensington Palace later this month, it is reportedPrince Harry and Meghan Markle could bring their two children with them, a source claims Image: Getty Images for Global CitizenByLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Oct | commentsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle could make a surpriseto the UK to attend a party to celebrate Princess Diana, according to reports.

But Silver Voices director Dennis Reed told the Mirror: “Instead of haranguing the BBC over ‘woke’, the new Culture Secretary must knuckle down and resolve the long-running free TV licence dispute. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “We have requested a meeting with the minister to discuss ways of settling this dispute before things get out of hand.” He warned that “fining and potentially imprisoning people in their s and s for protesting against the loss of this welfare benefit will occur on her watchshe fails to act”. The Tories pledged at the  election to maintain the benefit for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run for five years. But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the concession from summer , under a deal agreed in . The corporation introduced means-testing last August after warning that keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -.  Only over-s who receive Pension Credit have been eligible for free licences since August , worth £-a-year. An estimated . million have to pay. Mr Reed added: “The Tories promised to keep the free licence until , they must take this last opportunity to respect that pledge.” The BBC and Government are locked in an ongoing blame game, with ministers saying the broadcaster “agreed to take on responsibility for the over-s”. But in an email to Mr Reed earlier this year, BBC director-general Tim Davie said: “As we have discussed it was the Government who decided to stop this benefit.  “It was the BBC who then consulted on this issue and decided to continue to support the poorest oldest pensioners who receive Pension Credit.” A Culture Department spokeswoman said: We know how important free TV licences are to those over-, and we are deeply disappointed with the BBCaposs decision to restrict the concession to only those in receipt of Pension Credit. The BBC must ensure that it supports those affected and do so with the utmost sensitivity. It is understood the ministry has received many requests for meetings with the Culture Secretary since last month’s reshuffle propelled Ms Dorries to the Cabinet, and that officials will respond to requests “in due course”. A TV Licensing spokeswoman said: ”More than nine in  over-s’ households have now made arrangements for a free or paid licence, in line with the broader UK population, and we are grateful for their support. “We continue to support the small remaining group to get correctly licensed.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCNadine DorriesPensionsPoliticsTV Licensing AuthorityTV LicensingPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

During the wide-ranging interview, the -year-old father-of-one also opened up about his turbulent childhood, which almost included him and his siblings being taken into care after mum Mary was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The MP said he has faced mental health struggle which only became clear to him when a local councillor urged him to seek support. He said: It was an important moment, actually, because I thought, this is visible to other people. Iaposm clearly not happy. My Coyle said he appeared to be completely ing and was out and about in parliament, but the atmosphere in Westminster was febrile as the aftermath of the Brexit vote played out.  Things came to a head when his home, which he shares with his we and young daughter Esme, was targeted. He said: I had somebody break the window, my home, my bedroom window home during the Brexit debate. He added: There’s no way out the back, it’s a brick wall. So, I was sat with a cricket bat in case they came through. The MP said he needed help from therapists in the weeks and months ahead as the massive stress took a toll. He said: Iaposve had bouts of depression and things, but I have CBT . I think that when Jo was murdered, it triggered lots... that was a very dficult time. Mr Coyle, who grew up in Luton alongside two brothers and a sister, said his childhood was very dficult but, in the end, helped him to build emotional resilience.  He said his motheraposs mental health deteriorated when his father left. He said: Sadly, some of my earliest memories are the most dficult. There was a time where mum set fire to the living room carpet because she was trying to keep us warm. There was no intent to damage or harm anybody or the property. We used to have the coin meter. People donapost see them anymore, so they find it hard to understand - but I donapost know whether she didnapost have any money to work the heating system. I donapost know whether her mental health had collapsed so badly that she just didnapost know how to do it - but she set fire to the carpet. Mary was previously a primary school teacher and ran a drop-in club for kids, but her mental state crumbled very badly and she was eventually sectioned. Mr Coyle revealed how this occurred again recently, but she only got help after she crashed her car into a bollard. While no-one was hurt, a psychiatric assessment was ordered, he said. Mr Coyle said: It was only because she was in the criminal justice system that the magistrate was able to order a psychiatric assessment, and thataposs what got her back into mental healthcare, which is crazy. The system is crazy, not people. The MP added that he was grateful that as a youngster he wasnapost taken into local authority care He said: My nan was integral to keeping us togetheroutcomes for children in care in those days were dramatically worse than they are now, and theyaposre still very poor for many children.Comment MORE ON Labour PartyAsdaMental healthSocial servicesCrimeDangerous drivingCar crashesPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The government is said to be considering scaling back the current arrangements where everyone has free access to lateral flow tests and some people can get hold of PCR tests. This move was outlined in the governmentaposs winter plan last month.The report does not state exactly when the free access to lateral flow tests will end, but says changes will begin at some point in the future.A Whitehall source told the : “It’s agreed that universal access isn’t sustainable or necessary given high vaccination levels.“We now need to decide what the parameters should be that reasonably qualy access to free testing.”Ahead of the Budget later this month, the Treasury is thought to be convinced that universal free testing should be scaled back soon, and follows similar moves by Germany and France this month. But other parts of the government are hesitant about ending the scheme at a time when Covid cases could surge this autumn and winter. The Treasury and Cabinet are understood to support ending free mass testing, with one insider quoted as saying that the cost is the equivalent of p on income tax and that taxes could risethe scheme continues. Number  and the Department of Health and Social Care are believed to be more cautious as discussions take place between the DHSC and Treasury of announcements on all future departmental spending made in the Budget on  October. Downing Street is understood to be playing down the chances of mass free testing ending over the winter and the PM is expected to have the ultimate say on the whether the scheme should change. Free regular testing was first rolled out in April with the scheme touted as a key to tracking the spread of Covid and to getting back to as ­normal a le as possible. All adults in England, even those without Covid symptoms, were urged to check themselves twice a week with lateral flow swab tests. In June, the National Audit Office said  million lateral flow tests had been distributed to the public. Under the so-called winter plan, published last month, the government said it would continue to provide the public with access to free lateral flow tests in the coming months”.  At a later stage, as the governmentaposs response to the virus changes, universal free provision of LFDswill end, and iniduals and businesses using the tests will bear the cost, it added. Thequoted multiple government sources as saying that senior Treasury figures are convinced that providing universal free testing at a cost of billions of pounds is no longer the best use of taxpayers’ money.Asked whether he would end the universal free testing offer early next year, Health Minister Sajid Javid told Reuters: At the moment it is available. We havenapost made any decisions about next year.Comment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As a Northerner from a working-class background, I appreciate the sentiment. I’m usually grateful when someone highlights the lack of working-class voices wherever it may be – but not this time. Growing up on a Bradford council estate, I never imagined myself walking through the BBC’s lush London offices. But I have and I’m proud to say I never felt out of place. I started working on a science documentary at BBC Studios in June this year as a Junior Researcher and I only left last week. Granted, it wasn’t a long spell compared to many there, so my words don’t stem from years of long-enduring loyalty. But my experience was enough to know that I wholeheartedly disagree with Nadine.Do you agree with Tammieaposs comments  Have your say in the comment section below. My BBC bosses offered me a longer contract to stay. I wasn’t pressured to move to London from Bradford even though my production was London-based. They even paid for my train and hotel when I wanted to visit the office. According to Nadine, “ you’ve got a regional accent at the BBC, it doesn’t go down particularly well” - my colleagues from Glasgow, Oldham and Huddersfield might disagree with that. Her comment made me chuckle nevertheless. I, with my strong Yorkshire accent, was hired by an Executive Producer with an even stronger Northern accent. From Barrow-In-Furness to be exact, where he worked as a submarine painter. Nadine also claimed that the BBC is “staffed by people whose mum and dad worked there”.  I disagree, as does Faye Harland of BBC Radio Berkshire who told her Twitter followers that in her -year career at the BBC that she’s “worked with one person who was following in a parent’s footsteps. ONE.” Similarly, Mastermind host Clive Myrie added to the discussion explaining that his mum was a seamstress. But Nadine underestimates the public. We all know that she employed her daughters using public money, as The Mirror discovered back in . She’s trying hard to be relatable but unfortunately just comes across as a hypocrite. The media is a ridiculously competitive industry and it’s primarily a case of ‘who you know’. But Nadine’s accusations against the BBC - I’d even call it a vendetta, miss the wider issue completely and that’s dangerous for us working-class folk. There are many media companies out there guilty of nepotism but she’s completely firing at the wrong target. It’s an industry-wide problem not a BBC one. She’s let her extreme personal bias show. Why did she never throw ITV under the bus  Is she still sentimental from her time on “I’m a Celebrity…”  If Nadine claims she’s a working-class Northerner, why do I feel like I have nothing in common with her  I like to think I’m proof of an industry changing for the better. Nadine needs to refocus her accusations. Don’t look at me though, my parents are shopkeepers.Tammie Ash is part of the New Writing North’s Writing Chance programme. @NewWritingNorthComment MORE ON Nadine DorriesFurness NVITVBBC Studios and Post Production Ltd.DocumentariesMastermind\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That is despite think tanks putting the worst-case estimate at around , to , people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundationhas said the cut risks moving , people including , children below the poverty line. While the Legatum Institute think tank, led by Tory UC architect Baroness Stroud, says the change will hit , Brits who are currently just above the poverty line - including , children. But ministers have no official figure for how many people will be thrown into poverty because they’ve refused to do a formal impact assessment. And questioned by left-wing journalist Owen Jones at the Tory conference, Ms Dorries said: “Nobody. Nobody is.  “No no no, because, no Owen of course not. “Because what we’re doing, what we’re doing is giving people a step out. “By letime skills guarantee, by all the money being invested in the…” - she then walked away with an aide. Analysis by the JRF has found more than , working-age families in Ms Dorries’ Mid Bedfordshire constituency will be affected by the cut to UC and Tax Credits. That includes % of all working-age families with childrenand % of all working-age families without children . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “These comments show just how far away the Conservative Party is from the real world. “Charities and foodbanks have been warning for months that taking £, away from millions of families in the midst of a Conservative cost of living crisis will push children into poverty.” The cut officially began yesterday and will kick into payments from next Wednesday. Read more Boris Johnson did not mention it once in his -minute conference speech which was peppered with jokes.Katie Schmuecker of the JRF said yesterday: “The Prime Minister has not had the guts to look the millions of people whose incomes are being cut today in the eye and tell them how they are expected to get through the year ahead. “The Prime Minister’s attempt to strike an upbeat tone is completely at odds with the despair people are feeling and the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was asked the same question as Ms Dorries by Owen Jones. She replied: “Well it was always a temporary uplt, and that’s why no impact assessment was done when we knew it was temporary. “We are investing in the plan for jobs, we’ve also got the household support fund… we want to try and see what’s going on, what it is we can to help people with the skills so they can absolutely take advantage of higher-paid jobs.” Comment MORE ON Nadine DorriesOwen JonesJonathan ReynoldsBoris JohnsonConservative PartyPensionspovertyPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Out of control infection figures forced the government to cancel Christmas last year having ignored scientistsapos advice to lockdown early and hard in the autumn. As spring approached, months of lockdown, the vaccine rollout and immense amounts of effort from NHS staff began to pay off. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Deaths dropped into the single figures on some days while cases plummeted to one-to-three thousand a day. But the picture is altogether gloomier now and there are concerns that it could get worse.Since the start of summer when infections shot up, fuelled by Euro  crowds and eased restrictions, cases have remained above the mid-,s daily.That puts the UK at the top of the European charts, recording around , more cases per day than Russia in second place. While comparable Western countries like France, Italy and Spain are all currently at less than % of their peak number of cases, the UK is at %. The logic behind opening up the country despite the near certainty that cases would rise was that the roll-out of the coronavirus vaccine - which has now seen about % of the population jabbed twice - would mostly break the link between infections and deaths. For the most part it has. Yesterday  people lost their lives to Covid- in the UK and , new cases were reported. On January , when things were at their most bleak, , died and , positive tests were ed. The data show that as phenomenally effective as the vaccines have been at protecting people from the virus, the shield it offers is not total. More than  million adults in the UK have not been jabbed, meaning they are at much higher risk of catching, getting ill with and dying from Covid-. Department of Health data shows that unvaccinated people aged  and over are almost four times as likely to die after contracting the bug.  With such a large chunk of the population not opting to get vaccinated, the potential for cases and deaths to rise signicantly higher is great, particularly as the cold winter months draw in. Already the NHS is struggling to keep up with demand heightened by the virus.On Wednesday evening at least  ambulances were seen queuing up outside the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Hartshill, Staffordshire.Health bosses admitted that emergency departments across the area were under aposvery signicant pressureapos. The North Staffordshire Healthwatch leader said: The whole of the NHS and the whole of the care system are under extreme pressure. This is a crisis.  The fact of the matter is hospitals are taking huge amounts of ambulance deliveries, but the hospital is actually full at this moment in time. After more than a year and a half of battling the virus, more months of heightened pressure may push exhausted doctors, nurses and NHS staff to breaking point. Some parts of Britain are currently much worst affected than others.Covid is currently most prevalent in Wales , where there is a rate of one cases for every  people, followed by the e ast Midlands at one in  and Yorkshire and The Humber at one in . The South East by contrast has a rate of one in , while the South Westaposs is one in . Researchers working on the ZOE Covid study app found that the virus was running rampant among --year-olds following theto school - with one in  currently infected.Office for National Statistics data show that the infection rate has more then double in two weeks for those in Year  to Year , from .% to .% of the total population of that age group. That means every more than one in every   to -year-old in the UK currently has Covid. Englandaposs Covid- weekly reproduction R number is now estimated to be between . and ..An R number between . and . means that for every  people infected, they will on average infect between  and  other people. Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist on the ZOE Covid study app, said: we can only hope that some kind of herd immunity will kick in and cases will drop. There are several key factors that could make these already concerning figures much worse in the coming months. As with last autumn and winter, colder, shorter days will force people inside where the chances of passing on the virus are much greater. The vaccineaposs effectiveness may wane There is also signicant concern that the efficacy of certain vaccines will begin to wane.The protection against Covid infection offered by the Pfizer jab falters within months of getting a second dose, two new studies have found.Seven months after getting the jab protection from infection had dropped signicantly, the studies showed, meaning the potential to get the virus will be increased for millions of Brits who have had Pfizer. Thankfully protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death still remains strong at that point. In a bid to protect the more vulnerable, the government has said all over-s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers can get a third booster jab. Winter cold and flu is making a comeback Another serious issue that may aggravate the pandemic over the coming months is the flu. Today the government announced the biggest flu jab programme in the NHS’s history, with more than  million people in England eligible for a free vaccine.  Now that mask and social distancing mandates have been dropped, transmissions of the flu is likely to shoot up. Last year cases of the virus remained incredibly low, meaning natural immunity to the potentially deadly disease is likely rock-bottom at the moment. As well as piling more pressure on the NHS, catching flu and Covid at the same time is not only very possible, but signicantly increases the chance of death.By the worst estimates, , people could die from flu alone this year - compared to an average toll of ,.New strains may emerge A continuing point of concern are coronavirus strains, and the potential for another mutation. Earlier this year the Delta iant reached the UKaposs shores and, after months of dipping cases, led to an explosion of infections.The highly contagious Covid iant quickly became the dominant one after it was allowed into the country.The UKaposs high infection count due to Delta and a lack of restrictions, coupled with its relatively high vaccination rate, means it is prime territory for another, potentially more infectious iant to emerge. If the flu, increasing deaths among the unvaccinated and a new strain were to all hit at the same time, the government may have some dficult decisions to make. Last month it outlined a number of measures that could be brought in to keep cases down, such as ato working from home and the mask mandate. If these donapost work however, then yet another winter lockdown has not been ruled out. A senior government source said last month: “We’re going to approach it as we have done through the pandemic: be prepared. If cases become a problem and hospitalisations become a problem then we will act.

The -year-old man identied only as Graham appeared in a TikTok video posted by @novocabelohai on Monday. The clip shows Graham - who suffers with thinning and greying hair - being fitted with a custom hair system at Ruma Hair in Southport, Merseyside. The procedure involved matching his natural hair shade, applying adhesive, patching on the hairpiece and then snipping it to style. The on-screen caption reads: He [Graham] wanted to knowa hair system would knock some years off.  First we colour matched his hair and applied the poly skin base with a glue adhesive then started to snip his new hair into a style, it added. Graham wanted a low maintenance style he could manage easily. I wonder how many years we will take off  The clip has already been viewed over , times, with TikTokers ided over the results. Some say the treatment knocked off a decade, while others reckon Graham should embrace his baldness. One user wrote: I mean he looked  before Iaposd say  now but itaposs amazing what hair does. Crazy transformation! A second viewer said: Tidying up his beard probably made the biggest dference. Someone  commented: Why have people started calling wigs a hair system  Itaposs knocked a few years off but thereaposs no shame in being bald either. Do whatever works for you. In a previous video, Novo Cabelo said bald men should not pay over £ for Grahamaposs treatment. A hair system is a hairpiece constructed from synthetic or high-quality human hair to cover a bald area. Itaposs touted as the ideal non-surgical hair loss fix. Baldness is a normal part of ageing, the NHS says, adding that male and female pattern baldness is usually passed on by genetics.This comes after research found that only a third of people dating someone with hair loss wanted their partner to do something about it – with the vast majority happy with how their partners looked.Comment MORE ON NHSHairstylesHair transplantHair StudioViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Claire Vickers, , was left stuck on the slide for two hours with her shin bone poking out her leg and a shattered ankle, while her friend Barry Douglas, , broke his fibular and both ankles.They admitted they were idiots after sneaking into Aldershot Lido at am after theyaposd been drinking. But it can now be revealed Claire, who has five children, was given a community order after lashing out at a police officer in .  Sheaposd been arrested for drink-driving in Farnham, Hampshire, and was taken into custody, where she attacked the female cop. Zeltia Carrera, prosecuting, told a court: The defendant became physically violent in the holding area. She was restrained by several police officers and after failing to calm down she was taken to a police cell. Whilst being carried she kicked out at the detention officer. The victim fell against a wall and hit her arm - leaving further bruising.

She and Barry had been drinking in a nearby pub for several hours beforehand. The mother, of Aldershot, then suggested they head to the lido for a quick dip and they both crawled under a fence.

His dad Thomas Hughes, aged , and his partner Emma Tustin, , stand trial at Coventry Crown Court where they deny murder and multiple counts of child cruelty, reports Birmingham Live. During the second day of proceedings Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the jury that the defendants subjected Arthur to a campaign of cruelty in the weeks before his death which matched the medical definition of child torture. The hearing was dominated by text messages, audio clips and video clips exchanged between Tustin and Hughes between the end of March last year up to the day the schoolboy died. Arthur could be heard crying and sobbing in many of the recordings, in which he also begged to aposgo to nannyapos or his uncle Blake. In one he said: Blake no-one loves me, Blake no-one loves me. Mr Hankin stated Tustin was at her her home in Cranmore Road with Arthur and sent many of the clips to Hughes while he was at work or doing shopping. In a series of responses Hughes warned he would end him when Iaposm back, go to town on his son and take his jaw off his shoulders. In a further reply he instructed Tustin to put him outside or whatever, put him with the rubbish. The prosecutor also played a number of clips in which the six-year-old complained of hunger.  On one recording he was heard saying no-oneaposs going to feed me today and in another I want dinner and a drink today. Tustin appeared to complain about Arthur in numerous messages to Hughes and during one exchange in May, , stated I want you but I donapost want him, Iaposm sorry he treats me like s***, the court heard. In another text Tustin referred to Arthur as malicious, cruel and just generally awful while claiming he made her out to look like a liar to his father. Mr Hankin also told the jury that Hughes searched for pressure points on the body on his phone as well as sent Tustin a picture of a Taser followed by a message saying gonna thwack him. They were then played an audio clip in which Tustin recorded Arthur saying repeatedly Daddyaposs going to throw me out of the window. Outlining the law to the jury Mr Hankin said: The prosecution case is that the defendants bear equal responsibility for Arthuraposs death. In the weeks preceding it they collaborated in a campaign of cruelty intending to cause Arthur signicant harm and suffering. Violence and intimidation, both physical and verbal, were routine. He stated Tustin had been charged as the principal for murder because she was the only possible perpetrator for the alleged fatal assault on Arthur on June . Mr Hankin argued it was irrelevant Hughes was out at the time and that he shares culpability because he intentionally encouraged the offence.  The prosecutor told the court by June , the day before Arthur collapsed, the couple had lost the ability to judge what was right and wrong and lost their moral compass adding it was a matter of time before one of them really hurt him. Touching upon the opinion of a number of medical experts Mr Hankin stated one doctor concluded the abuse aposmeets the definition of child tortureapos. Both defendants also face four child cruelty offences. Tustin has admitted count two which refers to forced prolonged standing and or isolating Arthur within the family home and from his extended family and or intimidating him physically and or verbally. She denies the three other offences which relate to the wilful assault of Arthur, withholding food and drink and poisoning him with salt. Hughes denies all four offences. Mr Hankin also touched upon their defence cases saying aposeach directs blame towards the otherapos.

Jayne Nicholls and Alexander Doory were refused at the gate of their Naples flight at Luton Airport over an unclear ruling by the airline.They were told on October  that their fit-to-fly Covid results would not be accepted because they were outside the set time limitations, LeicestershireLive reports. Jayne said: We had our fit to fly test at .am at Colingtonaposs at East Midlands. They asked us where we were going and where we were flying so we thought we were sorted.  But when we got to the gate, we saw a young lad before us getting turned away. He looked really panicky, but he could only speak Italian so we couldnapost find out what was wrong. The -year old and her partner were told that their test result had to be valid  hours to when they landed in Italy - not  hours ahead of their departure time. The flight was scheduled for .am and was due to land .am UK time. The couple were  minutes shy of meeting the policy requirements.  She said: The whole thing was really confusing. It should be called fit-to-land. It wasnapost logical or fair and thataposs the worst thing. Some passengers were given a -minute leeway, but we were still out by  minutes so we were turned away. To me, itaposs just not clear. We lost money for airport car parking, flights plus we had to purchase new flights, new covid tests and new airport parking. Iaposm strong, Iaposm not a stressed-out person - but the situation actually pushed me over the edge. There wasnapost any apologies - we werenapost allowed to ask questions, and there wasnapost anyone that would help us or answer a question. EasyJet says the requirement was put in place by the Italian government. They urge customers to research Covid-related restrictions of their destinations.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email. A spokesman for EasyJet said: Passengers travelling from the UK the Italian authorities require a negative Covid test result to have been taken within  hours of arrival which unfortunately the passengers didn’t have. Like all airlines, easyJet is required to comply with the requirements of the local authorities in all destinations where we operate. Unfortunately, as the passengers were unable to provide negative test results inside the timeframe required by the Italian authorities, they were unable to travel. “Due to the fast changing, complex and widely ranging Government policies around restrictions in place across Europe, we are alerting customers to the importance of checking current local travel requirements ahead of their flight via email and on easyJet via our Covid- Help Hub, where they can also find access to government website links and the most up to date travel information.

Maria Thomas, , an administrator from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, felt the wall by her familyaposs dining table was very plain. She wanted to put her own twist on the room, and created an iconic installation on the cheap.Maria developed the concept from ling posts on Pinterest and Facebook - most of which used expensive components.So the mum-of-three decided to create a budget DIY version of the popular look. And social media users have been blown away by the £ hack – that just requires some wood batons, LED lights, paint, glue and nails.  Maria, who is mum to Spencer, , George,  and Ollie, four, also roped in her fiancé, George, , who she says did majority of the hard labour, while she was in control of making the project pretty. “George bought the wood batons and then drew the outline on the wall where we wanted them,” Maria said. “Once he attached the batons with wood glue and a couple of nails from BQ, which cost £, we then had to decide where to place the lights. “We bought some stick-on LED lights from Amazon for £, which are in a smart plug so Alexa can then turn off and on.  He doubled the batons so you wouldn’t be able to see them and then sanded the wood down until smooth. Iaposm thrilled with the finished result and super proud of George.

She urges anyone who wants to do DIY for less to take their time and compare prices to get the best deals.

Jean Bishop, who was known as Hullaposs Bee Lady because she dressed up as the insect to collect money for Age UK, died peacefully on October . In , she received the freedom of the city and was awarded a British Empire Medal in the New Year Honours. At the time she was askedshe would retire and said: There isn’t such a word.” Jean, who was born in Lincs. before moving to East Yorks. when she was young, was just a few months shy of her centenary.  She was known for dressing up in her bee costume and rattling her charity box throughout Hull to raise money for Age UK. The bee costume came about when borrowed it from Age UK and realised her distinctive outfit helped raise a lot of money. Jean later had her daughter make her bee costume with hula hoops and charity shop fabric.  Speaking in  about her work, she said: “I didn’t want to put the costume on at first, but when I did it went down like a bomb.” In the same year, she was recognised by the Queen for her dedication to helping others less fortunate than herself. As she received her medal, the monarch asked Jean why she wasn’t wearing her trademark outfit.  She replied she would, but it would have meant she “would have had to have paid for two seats on the train”.In , Jean was recognised as Fundraiser of the Year at the Pride of Britain Awards, with a bee suit-clad David Walliams presenting her with the award.In , she opened the Jean Bishop Integrated Care Centre, which provides out-of-hospital care for older people in Hull.  The centre, which opened during the week the NHS celebrated its th birthday, was named after her to recognise the impact she had made in her home city. She was only the second woman to be granted the freedom of Hull, following anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman in , and was also celebrated in board game form. Pam Morgan-Davies, CEO of Age UK Hull, said Mrs Bishop was a “complete one-off”. She said: She was groundbreaking, both in the way that she fundraised and how she made people of all ages feel comfortable. “The number of people who remember putting money in her tin when they were little, then they would come up with their kids or their grandkids and say, ‘I used to give you money when I was little’ - she loved that.”  Karl Turner, Labour MP for East Hull, paid tribute to the bright and bubbly woman. He wrote: I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Jean Bishop at the age of  this morning. I had the honour of opening the Jean Bishop Centre with her a few years ago. She was a bright and bubbly woman and leaves behind an incredible legacy in our city.

The four-day public holiday is planned so celebrations can take place across a four-day weekend in June , with an eye-popping budget of between £million and £ million. A huge “Platinum Pageant” is planned for the grand finale on the last day which will showcase the story of the Queenaposs reign and is set to take place through the streets of the capital. The likes of Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Ed Sheeran are being lined up to perform and are top of the list for organisers.Giant dragons the size of London buses and beasts as tall as three storey houses will create a spectacle and military and NHS heroes will come together next year to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.  More than , street performers are due to take part in the street parade on Sunday June  next year, Nicholas Coleridge, a co-chair of the pageant and chairman of the Victoria  Albert Museum, he said. It is set to run through Westminster, under Admiralty Arch, down the Mall, past Buckingham Palace and up past Constitution Hill, with people from across the country taking part. Dame Helen Mirren and legendary comic actor Stephen Fry are to join a Best of British cast. The four-day weekend will begin on the Thursday with Trooping the Colour, which will be staged in full for the first time since the pandemic, and a service of thanksgiving for the Queenaposs reign will be held at St Paulaposs Cathedral on the Saturday. Sundayaposs pageant will comprise of three acts, with the first seeing both serving troops and veterans take part in a march along The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace. The second act, entitled Celebration, will feature a puppet dragon larger than a double-decker bus with a wingspan the width of The Mall.  Others taking part will include a trapeze artist suspended underneath a huge balloon printed with an image of the Queen, as well as acrobats and other performers. The specially-written fairy story There Once Is A Queen by renowned author Sir Michael Morpurgo will be brought to le through artists on the day. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Mr Coleridge said the event will be larger than the celebrations during Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in . He told the Mail: It’s going to be the largest that’s ever put on, larger we think even than that that was put on for Queen Victoria. “It’s not going to be London-centric. We even have a giant map, making sure that we have people from every part of our country and indeed every part of the Commonwealth. “We’re going to have people from all  Commonwealth countries who are going to be taking part in this astounding parade.  He added that there will be all the pomp and circumstance of a normal royal event with the royal family playing a key role along with the procession of coaches and famous faces. While Elton Johnaposs Farewell Yellow Brick Road world tour clashes with the event, organisers hope the Rocket Man will still be able to have an input. The star had similar issues in  for the Party at the Palace which marked the Queenaposs Golden Jubilee. On that occasion he pre-recorded a set and, while this could be an option once again, there is also the chance he may appear via a live stream. A source told the Sun: They have got Ed Sheeran and Stevie Wonder, who appeared at the Diamond Jubilee celebration, on the top of their list of performers and the organisers have already reached out. The BBC has predicted that the showcase pageant on the final day will be watched by around one billion people across the world.  A Gallop Through History has been billed as a personal tribute to our monarchy and will feature more than  horses and over a thousand dancers and musicians taking the audience on a journey from Elizabeth I to the Queen. The monarch has a le-long love of all things equestrian and is being kept informed by organisers of their plans, and her ponies and horses are expected to feature in the event, with royal fans hoping to see members of the royal family taking part. Mr Coleridge added: “I suspect they may be slightly exaggerating but it’s going to be huge because it’s going everywhere.  “By the end of it, I hope we’re going to feel re-energised, highly patriotic and very much one nation as we all celebrate the Platinum Jubilee.” An extended bank holiday, from Thursday nd to Sunday th June, will begin with Trooping the Colour, which will be staged in full for the first time since the pandemic, followed by a service of thanksgiving for the Queenaposs reign at St Paulaposs Cathedral on the Friday. On Saturday, the Queen will be accompanied by members of her family at The Derby at Epsom Downs with a special concert outside Buckingham Palace in the evening. One courtier with knowledge of the plans said: “It is going to absolutely be the best of British on show and there will be something for everyone to enjoy on what will be a series of magnicent occasions during one of the biggest celebratory events for decades.” Members of the public will be invited to apply to attend this special event and details of the ballot for UK residents to secure audience tickets will be released in due course. More than  million people tuned in to watch the concert which marked the Queen’s th year on the throne.Fans were treated to a musical masterclass from the likes of Sir Tom Jones and Sir Paul McCartney, which celebs such as Jimmy Carr and Lenny Henry took up hosting duties.

The -year-old was born to a Kurdish family in Erzurum, Turkey. He left school at the age of  to become a butcheraposs apprentice and help with his familyaposs finances. It was during this time he was inspired to become a chef. Although most people will know him from the  meme, this wasnapost where his ambitious career started. In  Gokce moved to Buenos Aires where he worked at a restaurant, and learned more about the meat industry. Then, in , at the age of , he opened his first Nusr-Et steakhouse in the neighbourhood of Istanbul.

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.  The second world championship will take place in December this year, again virtually, and I hope to have even more people taking part. It’s amazing to be a part of people experiencing something new and fun, it doesn’t feel like work! Hannah’s story is a great example of how le can get better when you try something new, soyou already love Popcorn chicken - tasty pops of  per cent chicken breast, perfect to nibble on by themselves or as a side - then itaposs time to turn up the heat. Popcorn Chicken Zinger is the same delicious chicken and moreish crunch, but KFC have pumped up the spice for those who can handle a kick. Make sure you get your hands on a Zinger Popcorn Bucket soon - it’s only available until October .Download the app, head in store or order online.

The trucker was captured on camera slowly driving backwards over the track as a train approached at Wedgwood Station, in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, on Thursday. The HGV can be seen making it most of the way across the crossing before the gate came down on top of the truck - ripping the barrier clean off. It caused major disruption to passengers travelling on the West Coast main line between Crewe and Stoke as the route had to be closed.  Engineers worked for one-and-half hours to fix the barrier by pm following the incident, which happened at .pm. Network Rail today released the heart-stopping footage and warned motorists never to reverse over level crossings. James Dean, Network Rail’s West Coast South route director, said: “It’s almost unbelievable that this lorry driver decided to reverse over this level crossing, putting not only them but also the oncoming train and its passengers in danger.  “It’s not advice we usually need to give but now we must also stress to motorists to never reverse over a level crossing as you won’t see the warning lights. For those driving in the correct direction, our advice remains as it always has – although it might be tempting to jump the lights or race through the barriers – don’t - please just wait.” Comment MORE ON West CoastRailways\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We will certainly be enjoying a margarita or two on The Health Lottery.” And itaposs not just the winners that benefit, as money raised through The Health Lottery helps fund vital local community projects. £ million has been raised so far, for over  grassroots projects throughout Great Britain, supporting issues such as dementia, loneliness, learning dficulties and mental health.This is one of the reasons Sarah plays The Health Lottery online. “I have been playing The Health Lottery once a week since , picking two lines,” she explains.My nan had Alzheimer’s, so it is really important for me to support these projects. They are empowering the most vulnerable communities and tackling health inequalities around Great Britain. It is fantastic that I can give back a little to these wonderful projects by simply buying a ticket.” I asked my we to check all the numbers! For Nuneaton Rugby Club player, Allan Taylor, finding out heaposd scooped £, in last yearaposs New Year’s Day draw was a great way to kick of .  “You never think it is going to be you,” said father-of-three Allan, . “I couldn’t believe it was true! I asked my we and girls to all check my numbers. We wanted to make sure it was the real deal before we could properly celebrate! They were ecstatic about the news. It has allowed us to get that long weekend in Dublin that we have always wanted. I really fancy going on the Guinness factory tour and learning a little more about my favourite stout.” One of the reasons Allan plays is because it allows him to give something back. Playing The Health Lottery supports so many great causes. We are a family that has received some great support over the years from local causes. It is wonderful that we can give back to these grassroots projects simply by buying a Health Lottery ticket.” The size of the prize hasnapost sunk in yet! When Sue from Chesterfield got a phone call from The Health Lottery asking her to check her online Health Lottery account - something Sue hadn’t done in a while - what she saw changed her le. She had won £, in a second chance draw. “To be honest, I’ve been thinking about what I need,” said Sue, when asked what sheaposll spend the money on. I barely spend money on myself normally so this is a chance to fix up some things that need done. The garden. The house. Things like that. The size of the prize hasn’t sunk in yet so who knows what will be left. Maybe enough for a car  A holiday  It’s exciting to think about.” The former community worker says that playing The Health Lottery is a continuation of her work to support others. She said: “I’ve always been keen on helping people. I’ve been brought up that way. So I’d happily spend £ on a Health Lottery ticket because I know that it genuinely helps people. I’ve seen some of the good causes that are supported. Obviously I play the lottery for the prizes, as we all do, but the sense of supporting your community really sweetens the win.” It’s been a great moment to share In August , the News UK finance team syndicate scooped a fantastic £, after matching  balls, plus the bonus ball. Formed of eight players, the Peterborough-based team have been playing The Health Lottery for three years now – and were delighted to bag their first big win.  Syndicate leader Gary Smithdale said: “When I answered the call, the news came as a great surprise – I couldn’t wait to tell everyone! Some of us have worked together for over  years, so it’s been a great moment to share.” Their big win even inspired a new team name. “What about Sunshine  ” mused team member Margaret Lenton. “The sun’s shining on this lucky day, and there’s eight of us!”It is very important to support the local charities that benefit from Health Lottery salesKathy Brown, a Buckinghamshire Council Business Support Officer from Aylesbury, was delighted when she found out she had won £, in The Health Lottery’s draw online. Amazingly, this is the second time she has won a tidy sum by playing The Health Lottery, although her recent winnings dwarf the £ won previously. Big hearted Kathy says a big reason she plays is to support local causes and community projects: “In this day and age I think it is very important to support The Health Lottery and all the charities that are supported.”  While she plans on enjoying spending much of her winnings herself, she said she will make sure her daughters benefit too, selflessly spreading the joy to her family.

However, it is unlikely that low areas will experience snowfall.  He said: Likely areas to be affected are the Scottish mountains as well as higher ground in northern England and northern Wales. Low areas are unlikely to see any. It’s quite normal for this time of year. It comes as publications say a White Halloween is now feared, with odds slashed by bookies.  We better make the most of any balmy temperatures because the end of October looks set to be a big freeze, so much so that we make it odds on for snow to fall this month in the UK, said Coralaposs Harry Aitkenhead. We make it a - chance that this winter goes into the record books as the coldest the UK has ever had. Last week a blanket of snow hit Scotlandaposs highest peak with around cm falling on Ben Nevis.  Before the cold snap arrives on lower ground, Met forecaster Clare Nasir said that the country is having exceptionally mild weather this week. The air across the UK has been emersed by tropical conditions and what that means is that it is exceptionally mild as we head into Friday andyou catch some sunshine, feeling very warm throughout Friday afternoon, she said. Through the day we will see some sunshine for Wales, the Midlands, eventually northern parts of England and the West Country, always more rain towards the South East. Then this area of rain continues but it is mainly light rain, drizzle for the southern parts of the Highlands. To the north we see some brighter skies but the reason why we continue to see that rain warning for western Highlands and Argyle is because another pulse of rain will push up later on from the South West. Always a breeze in the north but the key thing about the weather like I said are the temperatures of C to C throughout the afternoon even where you see that cloud. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Rain continuing in the northwest but tending to ease, and clearing from Northern Ireland. Elsewhere, fog and low cloud slowly clearing to allow some warm sunshine for many, though staying cloudier in the far southeast. Tonight: Rain moving across parts of Northern Ireland and northwest Scotland, heavy at times. South and southeast England turning cooler with fog patches. Otherwise mostly cloudy with spots of light rain. Saturday: Fog lting over south and central England to leave warm sunshine. Cloudier where with rain in far northwest moving across Scotland and into north England whilst easing. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Mainly dry Sunday after patchy drizzle clears the south, some blustery showers across the north. Rain for the northwest Monday but dry for most into the start of next week.

Several dozen demonstrators spread themselves between Junction  of the M at Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, and busy Old Street in east London. The enraged parent was driving her daughter to class along the M when protesters gathered close to the Enfield junction delayed her school run. As she passed the campaigners - who were sat in a row behind a barrier - the mum wound down her window.  She then called the activists selfish and a disgrace and slammed them for putting their cause above education. She said: Itaposs backing up, all because all you care about is insulating houses. My daughter is late to school, you are messing with childrenaposs education because you are selfish. The mum then starts to drive away when she spots the woman filming the altercation. I hope you got that on camera, she says. The camerawoman then asks the angry mum what she thinks about the demonstrators. I think itaposs a disgrace. An absolute disgrace, she said. Meanwhile, on Old Street protesters were accompanied by aposofficial observersapos following several violent clashes with motorists since starting their nationwide demonstration in September. Met Police are at the scene and said in a statement: We are responding to two protests this morning which are blocking roads.  Activists are disrupting traffic around Old Street roundabout, #Islington. Theyaposre also disrupting motorists at Junction  of the #M. Weaposre on scene and working quickly to get traffic moving. The force added: We know that some activists have used super glue to frustrate our efforts and to delay Londoneraposs even further. We train for these scenarios and have specialist teams on hand to help remove people and make arrests. We will share more information shortly. The activists ignored an injunction put in place to stop them blocking traffic. Just before am this morning an ambulance was photographed as it tried to get past the protestors in Islington. Insulate Britain wants the government to insulate and retrofit homes across the UK to cut climate emissions.  Its members have caused chaos on the M five times in the past fortnight and were threatened with imprisonmentthey ed to the motorway.More than  Insulate Britain campaigners have been arrested at the protests, the Department for Transport said.The blockades have affected Essex, Hertfordshire and Kent since starting on September .Speaking last week to LBC Tracey Mulligan for Insulate Britain said: We have certainly got everybody talking about insulation or avoiding the question of insulation. We have got people considering that our government is legally failing in their duty to protect us and I think weaposre showing that Priti Patel, unfortunately, is trying to scare us with an injunction and that shows her lack of character, not ours. You canapost put an injunction on hunger, you canapost put and injunction on physics, and we are terried for our childrenaposs future and sick of over , people dying each year from the choice of heating or eating. When asked about breaking the injunction, she said: I wouldnapost say we are happy, we are just putting things into the bigger context. We are tired of over seven million people having to choose between heating or eating and we know thataposs going to get worse with the energy crisis that weaposre facing now.

A consultant told Jo her baby had died but her body didnapost know - a rare occurrence called a missed or silent miscarriage. But the mother, of Penarth, south Wales, gave birth to Cariad the next day after doctors gave her tablets and her own room with a bathroom. Jo took the pills, went into the bathroom and her contractions started but she didnapost have the strength to get back to bed. Her spouse Phil was not allowed to be with her due to Covid rules. Speaking to Wales Online, Jo said: “She [Cariad] was perfect. The most perfect little nose and eyes that never opened. I held her and sang to her. I told her how sorry I was that I couldn’t protect her. And then I had to leave her. Instead of bringing a baby home all I had was a little box with her footprints and photos. And so many unanswered questions.“I was in at am and out by pm. They wanted me to stay longer but I just wanted to get home to my kids.” A missed miscarriage, usually diagnosed at  or  weeks, is also known as a silent miscarriage because people often don’t exhibit the most common miscarriage symptoms such as heavy cramping and vaginal bleeding. One to five per cent of pregnancies results in a missed miscarriage, according to recent research. Doctors believe from their measurements that Cariad was around  weeks when she died. Jo is now determined to raise awareness of missed miscarriages and the support available to parents who lose a child. “A missed miscarriage is not something I’d ever heard of,” she said.  “I’d had none of the typical signs of miscarriage. There was no indication at all that anything was wrong. My le is all about my children and Cariad is no exception. I will always be a mum to five beautul children. Recalling the traumatic -week scan at Llandough hospital in Penarth, Jo said: I can’t describe the feeling. I told her she was wrong, that it wasn’t possible. How could my baby be dead and I didn’t know  Another doctor then came in and confirmed it. It was like my whole world stopped in that moment. It was like I went into autopilot, but I could barely even stand to walk out of the room “A consultant came to see me and explained I’d had a ‘missed miscarriage’ where my baby had died but my body didn’t know.”  The mum had already been through a challenging first lockdown, as her grandmother died and she was unable to go to the funeral. Joaposs family had largely isolated during the pandemic as her eight-year-old son Jack has non verbal classic autism and short bowel syndrome, and so needs regular care. Our house is pretty full and a bit crazy, le is very busy already with four kids and their additional needs, but there was no question of Cariad fitting in. We were very excited, Jo, who lives with kids children, Jamie, Jack, Kasey and Kali, and her partner Phil, continued.  Then the pandemic hit and we went into lockdown, and it was really scary. I was worried about catching Covid for Jack’s sake because he is clinically vulnerable - but also for my baby. One of the hardest things was not telling my mum and dad, because I couldn’t see them and I didn’t want to do it over the phone. Apart from my nana’s funeral it was nearly three months I didn’t see them for. “It’s been a scary time, because of Jack’s loss of bowel he picks up coughs and colds very easily and spends a lot of time in hospital having IV fluids,” Jo said. “Trying to home-school the children by myself with so many dferent children with additional needs, and then the baby running around, was extremely dficult.”  Now, Jo and her family cherish a photo of Cariad’s footprint, taken at the hospital. In June, a private funeral was held for Cariad with the help of James Summers funeral care in Penarth, with only Jo and Phil in attendance. “We held it at Barry crematorium,” Jo explained. “A poem was read for Cariad and we played two songs - The Last Lullaby by Itty Bitty Beats and Somewhere Over The Rainbow by Eva Cassidy. About a week later I was able to collect Cariad’s ashes.” In October, after receiving a full autopsy report for Cariad, Jo found out her daughter had Down’s Syndrome which had contributed to her death.  As the family approaches what would have been Cariad’s first birthday, Jo said she was determined to make a dference for people who experienced similar loss by raising funds for the Aching Arms charity and the Down’s Syndrome Association. “I was dreading it [Cariad’s first birthday]. I should be planning a party, buying presents and a cake,” she said. “Instead I have nothing. But I can’t let her birthday pass without doing something.  “At the moment I’m really focused on my fundraiser. I wanted to do something that would make a dference and help other people too.” You can see Jo’s fundraising page here, after she pledged to cycle km in October. “Depending on how it goes, I’d like to do something every year to raise money for dferent charities in Cariad’s name. I want to try and give her the legacy that she deserves. One of the places I’ve had support from is Aching Arms. They provide families with teddy bears in memory of their lost baby - something to hold on to when my arms feel empty. Theykeep me busy, there’s not a lot of time during the day to do anything ,” she added. “It’s the night time that is worse - when the house is quiet.

Ian Edwards was buried in the grounds of St Andrewaposs Church in Wolferlow, Herefordshire, after his death from asphyxiation caused by a tumour when he was just three years old. His mum and dad are now embroiled in a bitter row with developers who want to transform the church into a residential property. Ianaposs plot sits directly next to the historic th-century church - which is also a Grade II listed building - meaning his grave would be below the window of anyone who bought the property. Ianaposs dad Colin Edwards, , is battling with council bosses over immoral plans to transform the sacred place into a country dwelling. Colin still lives and works on a farm within sight of the church and has maintained the church grounds in the village for the past  years. He and former we Laura Edwards, , are also angry after Ianaposs grave was fenced off ahead of the proposed redevelopment. The pair fear that once the church is converted into a property they will be overlooked by its residents while laying flowers at Ianaposs graveside. They have also criticised the local CofE diocese after they sold the property without consulting the relatives of the deceased buried in the churchyard. Colin said he even tried to buy the church himself to just leave it as it is but was outbid by property developers and worries it could now become a holiday home. He said: Itaposs a house of God, not a holiday let. The dead should be given some dignity. You wouldnapost knock Westminster Abbey down to convert it into flats so why have the church allowed this to happen  I have mown the grass and trimmed the hedges for over  years. Who will look after the graves once itaposs developed   The fact it has been done without any consultation with relatives is also deeply concerning. The church has been part of this hamlet for generations and Iaposm surprised the diocese have just decided to part with it for the sake of some money. It is a sacred place and now my sonaposs grave and other relatives of mine are going to end up in somebodyaposs front garden. It will remain a working churchyard so Iaposm also not sure why the occupants would want to watch a funeral taking place outside their window anyway. Ianaposs mum Laura Edwards, , of Bromyard, Herefordshire, still visits her sonaposs grave several times a year.  She said she was devastated when she went to lay some flowers recently to find her sonaposs headstone inaccessible and lying behind a chain-link fence. She said: I just find the whole thing completely immoral. When I go to my sonaposs grave I donapost want to have a family watching TV looking out their windows at me. Itaposs a time for quiet reflection and you want your relatives to be in a peaceful place. I was devastated when I went up there and found it all fenced off. There has never been any signs up so why all of a sudden are they fencing it off for safety reasons  This could quite easily be turned into a holiday home so there could be all sorts of people there while Iaposm trying to grieve my son.  His grave is right up against the church window, it just seems completely disrespectful. They have sold it to the highest bidders without any care for the relatives of the deceased there. Because my sonaposs grave is under  years old it cannot be disturbed but their plans include digging up older graves for sewage and garages. It just doesnapost seem right to me. It has all been done without any communication either, my husband offered to buy it so he could continue to maintain it. But he had to chase them when he didnapost hear back to be told aposIaposm sorry, somebody has outbid youapos. He didnapost even get a chance to counter offer. He has maintained the grounds there for  years by himself. We have other family members there who died. It just the diocese has had little consideration for the relatives feelings and havenapost contacted us at any point to get our views on the matter. The Diocese of Hereford confirmed that the sale, believed to be in the region of £,, would not go through without planning permission first being granted. They also apologised for the distress caused by the some of the graves currently being inaccessible, adding: We are working with the insureraposs surveyor to seek a way forward that will allow access to the graves while still ensuring visitorsapos safety. Church representatives have offered to meet the family in an attempt to address their concerns.

Maria Philip, originally from Pathanamthitta, Kerala, India, was flying to Kochi from Heathrow on  October, but she started to experience pains shortly after takeoff. The plane had to stop in Germany, were mother and child were taken to a nearby hospital, with the airline vowing to fly them home when theyaposre well enough. The mum-to-be was seven months pregnant so wasnapost expecting to welcome her baby until later this year. Luckily she had the help of two doctors and four nurses who happened to be on board.  When the Air India crew realised what was happening, they found a gaggle of health professionals who were travelling on board and with their assistance, the baby boy arrived safely, while the plane was still mid-air. The plane then made an emergency landing at the nearest airport in Frankfurt, Germany, where mother and baby were met by medical staff and taken to hospital to be checked over. Air India has vowed to fly them both home to India when they are well enough. The flight continued the planned journey, landing in Kochi six hours behind schedule.  Air India said: Kudos to our crew and special salute to doctors and medical staff on board for making this easy for the mother. Our aircraft is well equipped with all necessary medical equipment and our crew are experienced to handle this kind of eventuality. Our officials are in constant touch with the family and all necessary support is being provided. Soon they will be flying home with us. May god bless the baby with a healthy and long le.

Within seconds, the canine starts to throw up some disgusting yellow liquid, then, to the owneraposs horror, a neon-pink vibrator. Warning - graphic video below  What do you think about the embarrassing moment  Let us know in the comments...In the clip, an assistant holding the dogaposs leash is seen retching in the background while the dog owner cheers: Woo, here it goes. The camera woman can be heard saying: Just walking away, yeah weaposre good. The Reddit user shared the clip along with a joke: When you want to party but you get too excited. One viewer said it happened to them in the past: I used to be a vet tech. We once got a Rottweiler to throw up oyster shells and condoms. The guy who brought him in said he needs to throw up. Wouldn’t say why. Many dog owners were left in hysterics and said their dogs also sometimes swallow very unusual things. My a**hole dog decided to eat a random used tampon we walked by. Then she puked it up on the living room rug and tried to eat it again, one shared. A second said her dog would go over the rubbish bin and eat rotten fish.

When she picks up a garden chair, the furniture obscures the view in front of her as she unknowingly places the hollow base of the chair on top of her pet, trapping it inside.

She goes on to say that the American version would be The Hunger Games, the Japanese would be Alice in Borderland, and one TikTok user quipped that the UK version would be The Great British Bake Off.  What do you think about the theory  Let us know in the comments...Taking to TikTok, the woman said: So in the section the VIPs come and they say theyaposre dying to know what the next game is, the other guy says apostheyaposve been amazing this edition, right apos and aposthe contest in Korea is the bestapos. Wait a second though, that implies that Squid Game is everywhere internationally. That means thereaposs a high chance that squid game in Japan is Alice in Borderland, and in the US is maybe Hunger Games. I canapost even begin to imagine what Squid Game in other countries would be like. Ruthaposs video soon went viral with over three million views, , likes and countless comments, mostly from people speculating what their countries version of the game would be.

Instagram star Natalie Bolyn, @thee_hair_gal, uploaded a video to social media explaining how customers coming in with dirty hair is one of her pet peeves.She said that some customers believe that having unwashed hair can help with the styling process, but Natalie insists that this is a myth. Natalie created the short clip, where she recreates a conversation with a customer, to spread the truth about the old-wives tale and encourage people to wash their hair before getting it cut.  What do you think about Natalieaposs advice  Let us know in the commentsNatalie wrote: I don’t know who along the way told people dirty hair is better for up-dos, but it is simply not true! Yes, a wash the night before you get your hair styled is usually the perfect canvas for upstyling, but this isn’t true for everyone - because like I’ve said before no one personaposs hair is the same! You know your hair! If you are prone to getting super greasy hair after not washing for a day then by all means wash the day of. I can make your hair dirty, I can’t make it clean. Don’t show up with five-day-old greasy smelly hair, that s*** will be amplied when I start using heat and no one wants to smell some greasy five-day-old hair. When we say aposdirty hairapos we mean washed the day night before. You don’t get extra credit for extra crusty hair. Natalie went on to share other top tips, saying that dry hair is fine. She continued: Do come with dry hair! If you wash your hair the day of please make sure you come with dry hair, wedding days are go go go, so to help prep your hair make sure it is dry for your stylist, we more than likely don’t have time to do a full blow out and style. Don’t straighten your hairOnce your hair is flat iron it isn’t going to hold a curl unless wet down and dried again.

In the advert, the man describes how he didnapost want a van, but his girlfriend did aposso we comprised and purchased a camperapos, and he set about doing it up. But then the woman left him, aposprobably for a man with a much more impressive motorhome than mineapos, so he decided to sell it - saying itaposs perfect for aposanother coerced partner, or sadistapos. What do you think about the campervan  Let us know in the comments...In the advert, the man writes: Well, well, well. Where do I start with this  Up for sale is my  Bedford CF campervan. A perfect restoration candidate for another coerced partner, or sadist. I never wanted a campervan, my now ex girlfriend did. So we comprised and purchased a camper, without ever laying eyes on it first might I add. It was intended to be a aposjointapos project which in reality turned into her standing around for half a day complaining about the shed weaposd bought, and the remainder of the time on my back about how long it was taking to transform it into her aposperfect tranquil cabin on wheelsapos. Yikes. Fast forward a few months and she decided to up and leaveleaving only behind this sad slab of misery on wheels. Apart from being an eyesore and driving down local property prices, it serves as a personal reminder that the last few years of my le have truly and utterly been a waste. As you can probably tell by this point Iaposm eager to get this thing off of my drive and draw a line under this turbulent chapter. So without further ado hereaposs a little more about the van. He then goes on to describe the good points of the van, saying that itaposs largely rust free underneath, good progress has been made on the conversion, and it doesnapost leak anymore.  It also comes with everything needed to convert it into a campervan, including a full wiring kit, water tanks, cladding, and a heater. However, the advert then goes on to describe more of the motorhomeaposs bad points - including the fact that it doesnapost run any more. Itaposs also got corrosion to the bodywork, will need repainting, and worst of all - it taunts me daily of my past failures and lost loveFor more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. The advert continues: If youaposve made it this far you are probably mentally unwell or still being forced into making a perfect love den for those romantic weekend getaways, either way, I applaud the dedication. If you do decide to bid on it and God forbid you actually win, you will have to get it transported or collect it yourself as I have neither the time, the means or the will to deliver it for you. I will do my best to answer any serious queries, butyou ask me about the flow rate of the shower for example I probably wonapost. Itaposs not perfectnor road ready so donapost expect it to be and you wonapost be disappointed, itaposs a cheap project and a good way to break into the world of motorhome owning. Iaposm just trying to get a little money back so I can go on a heavy night of drinking, perhaps visit a lady of the night depending on how well the auction goes and then close this awful chapter of my le.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Mum Lianne, who lives in Essex, said: I’m assuming it’s a slug but it looks very, very weird - especially when the luminous thing lights up around his stomach. I was in bed and got notied that something at my front door was making a motion. I was a bit freaked out at first and then when I played it back, I started laughing! I put the video on my social media and everybody was messaging me to say that they found it all quite funny! When I took my daughter Gracie to school yesterday morning, I did have a look to seethere was a trail but there wasn’t anything there.  In the unusual clip, the slug can be seen slowly emerging in front of the camera from the bottom left corner, its antennas leading the way across the lens. The night vision setting on the Ring doorbell makes the slug look like itaposs glowing - leading Lianneaposs friends to believe it could be an alien. Lianne said: When I showed my friends, they were a bit freaked out - they gave me the kind of look like they thought there was a ghost or an alien or something.That made me laugh because I don’t believe in aliens, but considering I saw two little antennas pop up, it was either a very green man from space or a slug crawling on my doorbell. Iaposve had the doorbell for about a year now and my daughter found it very funny - she was a bit freaked out when she watched it this morning, she said it looks like an alien slug.

But one ingenious firm might be about to end the issue of your partner farting excessively in bed - and it could potentially save relationships. One of the big issues when sharing a bed is excessive noises and smells, especially when it happens constantly. But this anti-wind bedding could be the product for you - from firm Shreddies, who previously launched anti-flatulence underwear. According to the company, the duvet cover and undersheet have carbon  built in to trap smelly gas, in a bid to help those farting - and the unlucky ones sleeping next to them.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here A description of the duvet says: The Flatulence Filtering Duvet Cover includes an inbuilt carbon  to trap flatulence gases before they escape through your duvet. You can simply insert your own Duvet into the cover and your gas will be discreetly filtered all night long. Using the same technology found in our award-winning underwear, the porous carbon attracts and traps flatulence odours and is simply reactivated when washed.  The firm reckons the average person farts up to  times every night — though we think some would say their partners are well above average. Spokeswoman Rebecca Jones said: “Many experience excessive flatulence at night. This is because when you’re lying down the gas in your body ‘pools’ inside your colon rather than coming out a little at a time as it does in the day.Throughout the night this gas is released and can cause an unsettled night’s sleep and an unpleasant odour.” And the new product seems to be a hit, as she added: The bedding is selling very well and we’re really pleased with initial sales.” The company said: We know from speaking to our customers that bad flatulence at night can drive spouses from their marital bed.Check out the duvet covers - which start from £ - here Comment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Solomon Islanders Licvae Nanjikana and Junior Qoloni set out from Mono Island on September  on what should have been a -mile voyage to new South Georgia. The experienced seamen had taken the trip before and planned to use visual markers to help guide their route. But the pair ran into disaster when torrential rain and heavy winds battered their small motorboat. During the storms, their GPS packed in and the men found themselves cast adrt in a notoriously rough and unpredictable stretch of water. “We have done the trip before and it should have been OK,” Nanjikana told the . Without global positioning, they had no way of telling which direction to turn. They decided to stop the engine in the hopes of saving fuel, Nanjikana said. The men had taken a store of oranges with them, which helped to keep them alive. Another source of food came in the form of coconuts bobbing along the waves. The men fought off dehydration by using a piece of canvas to catch falling rain. The duo floated  miles before being spotted by a fisherman off the coast of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. “We didn’t know where we were but did not expect to be in another country,” Nanjikana said.  The men were so weak when they were rescued on October  that locals had to carry them off the boat. They are currently living with a local resident in Pomio on the south of New Britain island. Nanjikana said the ordeal was a nice break from Covid, thereports. “I had no idea what was going on while I was out there. I didn’t hear about Covid or anything ,” he said. “I look forward to going back home but I guess it was a nice break from everything.” Earlier this year, a trio shipwrecked on a deserted island in the Bahamas were rescued after somehow surviving for  days.  The two men and a woman told their stunned rescuers they had managed to survive the epic ordeal by eating coconuts. The castaways claimed they swam to the uninhabited island after their boat capsized in rough waters. Dramatic footage captured the moment a chopper crew who spotted the marooned trio on a rocky outcrop dropped them le-saving supplies. The crew said the three people had desperately waved flags as the craft flew over Anguilla Cay, an uninhabited Bahama Banks island, during a routine air patrol on Monday. A US Coastguard helicopter crew filmed themselves parachuting the supplies from the aircraft. It captures the moment the three castaways stranded below realised salvation had finally arrived. The chopper crewaposs footage also captured a makesht encampment the group had built on the island. The man and two women, who were said to all be Cuban nationals, reportedly told their rescuers they had been stranded for about five weeks on the archipelago, which is located between Cuba and the Florida Keys. None of the castaways appeared seriously hurt, the United States Coast Guardtold reporters.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

Kick off is pm.For more information follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 8 2021","story":"I love how the green leaves of the trees slowly change into a golden yellow colour before the tree disperses of them and they gently fall to the ground.The tree seeks a time of rest in winter and therefore needs to let go of all its decayed leaves so that it can bud in spring and flourish in summer.Watching this process reminds me of an important lesson that we can learn from the trees as we enter into the autumn period and look ahead to the winter months.Just as the trees don#t stubbornly hold onto their dead leaves, so must we seek not to hold stubbornly onto any unnecessary hurtful weight in our lives.Ephesians  v  –  reminds us that we need to get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.Are you perhaps holding onto something that is preventing a freshness to the season ahead Could it be that the decayed leaves are piling up in your heart and you need to discard of them for good If so, why not reach out to the Lord in prayer because He longs to hear from you.Ask Him to reveal any thoughts, circumstances, issues, or any other #decayed leaves# that you may be stubbornly clinging to, so that you can release them and watch the leaves fall and drt away this season."},{"url":null,"title":"three points for pupils u17s after incredible comeback","story":"Campbeltown Pupils s ed to Kintyre last Sunday with three points after a remarkable Glasgow and District Youth Football League match.Trailing - with  minutes to go, the Ardshiel Hotel-sponsored side clawed it back and won - with an -minute winner.Despite a bright start, the Pupils were behind - after nine minutes.Two minutes later, it could have been - but for the brave defending of Kyle Paterson as he made a last ditch tackle which resulted in the youngster leaving the park with a nasty head knock # and not ing.This was a huge blow to the Pupils and worse was to follow as Cambuslang Rangers made it - from yet another set piece.Having weathered the storm, the visitors found their way back in to the game and reduced the deficit to one when Calum Ellis raced through on the th minute to make the half time score -.A positive start in the second half was quickly dampened as the North Lanarkshire side made it -.Ryan Shields closed the score line again as he raced through and showed composure with a fine finish, only to see the home side increase the lead to -  seconds later.Worse was to follow as the Cambuslang side made it - with a fine -yard strike.With  minutes remaining, it looked like the under-s were facing their first defeat of the season.However, there is a fighting spirit and never say die attitude in the teenagers that will serve them well as they develop into the adult game.With a spirited team display by every single player, Calum Ellis scored to make it - before pulling another back with  minutes to go.The equaliser was to follow on the th minute from Ellis before he scored his fth of the day with a penalty box scramble to make it - to the Campbeltown side.#This was a truly remarkable comeback in a game that will be talked about for many a year,# said manager David Paterson.The s have no game this Sunday due to the school holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

The card had superior artistic merit and I wanted to make use of it in the book, which was to include a number of old cards by the celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore.The problem, however, was that no information was forthcoming where this obscure cottage had been or how it had earnt sufficient fame to be depicted by Phillimore.The book was published in  without lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo being featured.The purchase of another Edwardian postcard belatedly solved the mystery in August : it turned out that the careless Phillimore had got the name wrong, since it was not lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo but lsquoCleikimin Tollrsquo!And indeed, inquiries demonstrated that this turnpike and tollhouse had been standing at the cross between the road from Dunbar to Spott and the road from Broxburn to Belton. It is likely there were two turnpikes, one on each road. The tollhouse was said to be very old, quite possibly constructed in the first half of the th century.In early Victorian times, the tollgate system kept flourishing all over Britain. In rural west Wales, there were full-scale riots in  after a number of novel turnpikes had been erected, something the locals disapproved of. Men dressed as women attacked the turnpikes and beat up the tollkeepers, and it was only with dficulty they could be pacied.Cleikimin Toll was spared such indignities, however: it was still operational at the time of the Ordnance Survey of -. The name-book of this survey [OS    ] refers to it as a ldquoA Toll Bar at a junction of roads situated about half a mile south of the town of Dunbar.A note explains Cleikimin as a name usually applied to a cheap public house, where a Cleik [Scottish for fish-hook] was supposed to have been made use of to pull the customers inside.The arrival of the railways did much damage to the old tollgate system all over Britain: as a result, the road toll revenue plummeted and the tollkeepers grumbled incessantly.The Scottish municipal authorities realised the old-fashioned turnpikes were on the way out, and by  they were all gone.The tollhouse at Cleikimin Toll stood well into Edwardian times, being admired as a quaint relic of olden days.

We played a lot of new bands who wanted to spread the word about their record and there werenrsquot many outlets at the time. But, also, there are records as extreme as Iron Maiden or Spandau Ballet that I hadnrsquot really paid enough attention to in the past and I really enjoyed them.The series is approaching its th edition. The week after we speak itrsquos confirmed that the album chosen is Blondiersquos Parallel Lines and Chris Stein and Debbie Harry will be involved.ldquoWersquore going to make a big deal out of it with a show at the South Bank, so itrsquos going to be live.The listening parties are set to carry on then  ldquoSince it began people have always asked when itrsquos going to end. Itrsquos the same thing with The Charlatans.ldquoI have no idea. It has changed shape so many times. Therersquos no sign of it stopping but there are signs of it changing all the time. Wersquoll just see what happens.Hair colour aside, you could be forgiven for thinking that Burgess, now , hasnrsquot changed at all since he emerged out of Northwich as a cherubic-looking -year-old with the Charlatans in .Next month sees a slightly belated, Covid-delayed, celebration of the bandrsquos th anniversary with a series of gigs that will continue through to December and the release of a ldquobest of album, A Head Full of Ideas .The Charlatans in Back in , when the band emerged as part of the then current baggy scene, you might have thought longevity wasnrsquot baked in. Yet The Charlatans quickly established themselves as one of the great single bands of the s, a habit that has continued into the st century . And thatrsquos before mentioning  albums.ldquoItrsquos been my le, Burgess says simply. ldquoI guess I was  when it started and there have been real intense times. Hugely rewarding moments and other times that werenrsquot so good.ldquoAfter Rob died there was real trauma, Burgess admits. ldquoWhen Wonderland came that was it, really. I know we made an album in between, but that was a stepping stone. When we put out Wonderland it blew any doubts.You go on because you go on  ldquoA lot of it is to overcome the challenge. There is that famous saying, lsquoItrsquos what he would have wanted.rsquo There was a lot of that.ldquoAll the work that Rob had put into the band beforehand why would it have to stop  Itrsquos something to build from really, and once you have that in your head space then itrsquos OK. Itrsquos just finding your way to make that work.ldquoAnd then with Modern Nature after John died hellip We couldnrsquot have made the record while he was alive because it was physically impossible for him and heart-breaking to the band.Le is a catalogue of loss, Tim. And Irsquom speaking from a few years on down the road.ldquoHow is it I wouldnrsquot be in any rush, I tell him.But letrsquos go back in time to the beginning. Why did he want to be in a band in the first place ldquoThe chance to say something about where I was from and what I was thinking and to be able to do it with people who had a real strength musically.ldquoRob had a vision that it would be Hammond organ-based, and he would create a sound that would be a little dferent from other Hammond organ players in the past. And I think we were all quite happy for him to lead the band at the beginning.ldquo We worked with Chris Nagle, who was a big part of the Factory sound with Martin Hannett, and he gave us more of a modern sound. We sounded quite sixties in the rehearsal room. He gave us a more dancey thing, which we were all interested in anyway. It was more of a nineties sound, and I think what he did for us really helped to make it more widescreen.Burgess admits that it took him a little time to find his own voice as singer. ldquoIrsquod always been in bands, but some of the stuff that I was into before was more Jim Morrison more Iggy Pop. We even did cover versions of the Cult in my band before.ldquoSo, I went with that in mind, and I remember Martin [Charlatans founder and bassist Martin Blunt] saying to me, lsquoOh letrsquos try this song again, but can you sing this time rsquoldquoWhat it did was stop me overdoing something and be quite relaxed. And I guess thatrsquos how I found myself.That was then. In the years in between Burgess has had his wild days, his rock star years, but he has never lost himself. How does he look back on that -year-old version of himself ldquoOh, very fondly, very fondly. Hersquos still there inside of me somewhere. I suppose being a dad as well brings all that back to you. It is a beautul thing.What he has also never lost is his enthusiasm. If anything, with the Listening Parties and his solo work, as well as writing books and running a record label, he has been more engaged than ever of late.ldquoTheyrsquore all part of me. I treat everything with the same amount of respect. You just keep at it, really. Itrsquos just enthusiasm for music.ldquoAnd thatrsquos how it started for me anyway, just a general enthusiasm for music. Other things got in the way ndash being in the music game there are a lot more obstacles than just the music.ldquoBut you donrsquot know that when you first start.As for now, despite derisory streaming payments, despite the challenges to gigging that every band is facing, he is still hopeful that there will be more new music and not just from him.ldquoHopefully bands start getting more than they are and maybe there will be something positive.I can only think like that that wersquore moving towards something that is better.Tim Burgess is getting on a train. Hersquos moving forward. Itrsquos what he has always done.A Head Full of Ideas is out next Friday.

The Carbost project is among  which were completed following lockdown with the Scottish Land Fund contributing more than poundm to help the buy outs.In Carbost, the shop never closed during the buy out process and villagers got behind it at the height of lockdown last year.Cathy Simon, one of the directors of the shop, said: \"Apart from the challenges of working our way through buying property during lockdown, covid showed us how important it was to have a community shop that would support our local village with essential supplies and help deliver to those vulnerable people shielding.ldquoOf course covid delayed the process required to go through buying a property but we are so pleased we did it, and we have made signicant progress since buy out this January with some essential repairs. We are so proud that we never shut the shop for one day with the transfer of private ownership to community ownership.The shop, housed in a  year old corrugated iron building, was bought by the community with a grant from the Scottish Land Fund of pound,. The SLF also supported the preliminary work required for the purchase, with community engagement, business planning and  monthrsquos salary of a shop manager.The property had been on the open market for several years as the previous owner sought to retire from the business. Following a public meeting in , volunteers Cathy Simon and Janette Sutherland formed a steering group with colleagues to work on the community buy out. The completion date for the sale of the property was initially set at April , right at the beginning of the first lockdown, but it was delayed until the successful acquisition in January .ldquoWe struggled during lockdowns, as everyone did, to get tradesmen available to help with essential repairs, but we have now improved the toilet facilities thanks to some fantastic local volunteers, added Mrs Simon.ldquoThe shop serves a community of  year round, and business increases signicantly with the huge numbers of tourists in the summer season.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

The new measure requires people going to nightclubs, concerts, some football matches and other large events to prove they have received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.Wales is also bringing in a similar scheme, due to launch on Monday October .Sir Ed told the virtual conference: ldquoLiberal Democrats have always been clear. Covid ID cards are unworkable, expensive and illiberal.The Lib Dem leader insisted such schemes were ldquonot a real solution and would ldquoplace an unfair extra burden on local businesses whorsquove been through so much already.Liberal Democrats have adopted a ldquoprincipled response to them across the United Kingdom.## @EdwardJDavey: Itrsquos only been us @libdems with clear principles across the UK, taking a clear and principled position that unites our party across England, #Scotland and Wales.mdash Scottish Lib DemsOctober , And he contrasted this approach with those of the other parties, saying the Conservatives were ldquopressing ahead with plans for vaccine passports in England while at the same time opposing them in Scotland and Wales.Meanwhile he said: ldquoLabour arenrsquot sure where they stand in England, but they oppose them in Scotland, and are bringing them in in Wales, and they even required Covid ID cards for their own party conference in Brighton.The Scottish Greens had ldquoseemed to oppose them until a co-operation agreement with the SNP took them into government at Holyrood, and then ldquothe Greens voted for them.Sir Ed insisted: ldquoItrsquos only been us ndash the Liberal Democrats ndash with clear principles across the United Kingdom, taking a clear and principled position that unites our party across England, Scotland and Wales.The Liberal Democrat leader also used his speech to hit out at Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquocruel Conservatives after the UK Government reduced Universal Creditpayments by pound a week, despite criticism from the other parties and anti-poverty campaigners.He accused the Tories of ldquoslashing the incomes of millions of hard-pressed working families by pound, a year with their cut to Universal Credit at the same time when food bills and heating bills are rising.Sir Ed said: ldquoTheyrsquore not just incompetent.

But pupils had to also develop their presentation skills to explain their design plans to their peers.The Spaceflight Programme, run by the UK Space Agency, has invested over £M to develop three spaceports in Cornwall, Shetland and Sutherland. The UK will soon have the ability to launch small satellites from horizontal and vertical launchers operating from spaceports located around the UK, including the SaxaVord UK Spaceport in Unst.The work done by Shetland pupils will be submitted for judging, with the winning designs announced in the coming weeks.Head Teacher at Whalsay School Garry Spence said: “Our pupils have worked really well together in their groups and they’ve been fully engaged with this competition. They’ve learned a lot about spaceports and we hope some of them have been inspired to consider work in the space industry, which realistically could soon be in Shetland.”..Shetland is on the cusp of a major boost with the UK government ready to approve the creation of an isles spaceport in Unst – aTwo inspection reports have been ed for isles schools, providing mixed results.#Nothing has changed# in the race to bring a spaceport to Unst.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place. Mid and East Antrim Borough Council have supported us through the process of applying for the Innovate UK Challenge Fund to address the current and future impacts of Covid-. With their support, we successfully secured the funding to develop our Coffin Pod.“We are delighted to have now launched this into the market, and to have been awarded the Innovate NI Gold standard for this product. We continue to develop our core product ranges of hearses and limousines and have several new vehicles under development.”Speaking about the ongoing support received by the council, Patrick added:“Through our interaction with Council’s Business Client Manager, Barbara Orr we have received support through the Business Escalator and Business Escalator Plus Programmes to develop our export markets and growth development. The support through the programmes and assistance from Barbara has been truly worthwhile and I would recommend that businesses in our borough take advantage of the help available.“As we continue to move forward, we aim to make use of the assistance in the many dferent areas of running our business, to grow and create more jobs for the people of Ballymena.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “Quinn Hearse  Limousine is just one of many companies across Mid and East Antrim to have benefitted from support via Council’s Amply programmes, since the launch of our economic development strategy in .“As well as supporting our SMEs to navigate through the current challenges posed by COVID-, we are preparing for the new economic landscape as we navigate post lockdown, and have provided expert guidance to support Quinn Hearse  Limousine with its longer-term business development strategy.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Business Escalator and Escalator Plus Programmes are part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.To find out more make an enquiry today via midandeastantrim.gov.uk EscalatorPlus "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633709144535.jpg--covid_19___fri_8th_october_figures.jpg?1633709144000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211008newscovid 19 fri 8th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

However, the figures alone do not explain the cause of this increase, he said.I have tabled several follow-up questions to the Minister to seek clarication on the reasons for the year-on-year increase in these costs over the last five years — rising from £, in the   financial year to £, in  .A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “We have no evidence of a rising pest problem. “We take the issue of pest control in our properties seriously. When reported to us, our team triage pest control reports, treating each case inidually.“We quickly asses the nature, scale and severity of the request, based on the effect on our tenants and properties and engage pest control officers when necessary.“We receive around , requests for help and have been spending in the region of £, each year.”During a meeting of BCC#s People and Communities Committee last month, councillors hit out at the city#s truly disturbing pest problem.Sinn Fein’s Matt Garrett said: I had a tenant, a resident in my own area, in a Housing Executive property, who was walking about his house with a vacuum cleaner pole because his house was infested with rats.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsAndy AllenBelfast City CouncilMore On Andy Allen PremiumCost of living crisis ‘puts our most vulnerable people at risk’ PremiumCourts hand out over , speeding fines in five years PremiumCall to strip Capita of benefit payments role after firm fined £.m for failings PremiumFirst and Deputy First Ministers urged to explain delay in welfare mitigation legislation PremiumCharities need £m Covid- support now, Hargey is toldMost ReadFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeNI voucher scheme: how to get more bang for your buckHow ‘Costa del North Coast’ no longer haven for working class as house rental hits £k for a week‘Kind, unassuming and effective’: Boris Johnson and Micheal Martin lead tributes to former NI SecretaryAntrim care home struggling with Covid outbreak amid workforce crisisTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated PlayVideo: The moment a Turkish F Jet misses a crowd of onlookers at Waddington AirshowLatest Northern IrelandWinter months could see ‘greatest pressures ever experienced’ by health serviceBallynahinch look to get back on track with disciplined displayDavid Healy relishing Windsor reunion with old ‘bubbly’ Preston pal Stuart King as Linfield take on CarrickPaddy McNair is ‘fully deserving’ captain on th Northern Ireland capAll-Ireland heroes step into the limelight again as Tyrone championship engages a higher gearLatestWinter months could see ‘greatest pressures ever experienced’ by health serviceHeads call on ministers to cancel Sats exams in  amid Covid- disruptionPackham leads children’s march to Buckingham Palace to ask royals to rewild landRowling to celebrate Harry Potter anniversary with champagne and cheese on toastManager Robert Page urges Wales to seize World Cup play-off place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s failing people.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It#s actually very current, and it impacts people#s lives here today and has been detrimental to relationships on this island and across these islands. So I think it#s wrong.”Mr Martin said he was “surprised” at Sinn Fein’s decision not to send anyone to the service.“Sinn Fein would have attended events last September at the Presbyterian Church — an event more or less the same type to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland and partition, so I don’t get the consistency of the Sinn Fein viewpoint on this quite frankly,” he said. “I would ask at this stage we need to move on in terms of walking collectively together on this island in the spirit of reconciliation.”Responding to the Deputy First Minister’s comments, DUP MLA Peter Weir said Ms O’Neill and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald have no dficulty in attending tributes to IRA terrorists.Sinn Fein#s attitude, and that on display from other quarters in the Irish Republic is a clear demonstration of what their #new Ireland# would really be like,” he continued. “Underneath the platitudes there is no acceptance of the British identity in Northern Ireland and absolutely no desire to engage in any kind of reconciliation.”Meanwhile, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said on Thursday the EU was preparing to table proposals aimed at reducing the Irish Sea trade friction as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Mr Martin said there is a “window of opportunity” for the UK and EU to resolve the issues, adding he would not “underestimate the challenges of this”.“I do believe that United Kingdom Government and the European Union have to get down to really serious discussions on the proposals that will emerge shortly,” he stated.Mr Martin said the proposals from the EU and UK should be used as a “” to find resolutions.

Not unionists as they’re often represented in the media or by some politicians — always angry, negative, and fearful — but as ordinary folk living their lives the same as everyone . There is no single stereotype that fits.The mood in the broadcast is a million miles from that of angry protesters on the streets lambasting the protocol or those wanting to turn the clock back to another century.It’s grounded in Northern Ireland , and it’s forward looking. Never has a political leader in Northern Ireland altered the image of his party so rapidly.Beattie is just four months in the job, and the pace of change is phenomenal.There have been new, high-profile recruits an Assembly candidate from a working-class nationalist background and a drive to bring in more women, although the party has a long way to go on the journey to gender equality.Beattie will address his first annual conference in Belfast tomorrow. The most welcome guest will be hope.In just four months, the new leader appears on course to do what has eluded his predecessors over almost two decades — reverse the UUP’s decline.It has long been on the back foot. Despite Red Sky, RHI and the alphabet soup of scandals that have hit its rival, it has never been able to land a blow on the DUP.For the first time in a long time, there is excitement and confidence in the party’s ranks.The UUP is up from % to % in LucidTalk opinion polls since he took up the reins. That helps the new leader hugely. Success breeds success winning becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.But there are dangers too. Some observers believe the ‘Beattie bounce’ is over-hyped. It’s one thing changing the party’s image and making gains in the polls. Transforming its fortunes by securing votes in an actual election is a trickier matter.The weight of expectation now lies on Beattie’s shoulders. He certainly can’t be accused of playing it safe. Every unionist leader at one point or another talks of the need to change, few have followed through.There are risks involved. How will the latest party broadcast go down with traditional UUP members in rural areas Beattie’s views don’t always chime with conservative grassroots members, although his personal popularity, military background and those positive poll results help him with that section of the party.But a good Assembly election result next May is crucial for his leadership. The UUP must win more seats in Stormont.

Credit: Alan Currie Getty ImagesGillian HallidayTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNearly two decades on from Lisburn achieving city status, UUP Alderman Jim Dillon has recalled how, in the lead-up to the decision being announced and celebrated with the popping of champagne corks, an official visit was made to the area by then Labour Secretary of State Dr John Reid.At that point, Mr Dillon was mayor, and had been forewarned by a civil servant that Dr Reid, now Baron Reid of Cardowan, had a two-hour window and “not a minute more”.This was two months before the Secretary of State’s visit, and as Mr Dillon noted, it was important Mr Reid left with a good impression, saying: “The Secretary of State plays a big part in it. The day he came and the two hours were up, the secretary walked over to him and said, ‘We need to go now’. He said: ‘Have you another packet of fags  I’ll be here at least another hour yet’.“I came back to my secretary an hour and a quarter later and threw my hands up in the air, [saying], ‘We’re going to get this, we’re going to get this’.”When the secretary asked why he was so sure, he replied, “I just got the vibes today”.The decision was announced by then Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine in March  as part of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee celebrations, giving Lisburn a lord mayor title as well. Other places across the UK received the title.For Northern Ireland, it was a tale of two cities as Newry was also conferred with city status, with Carrickfergus and Ballymena in Co Antrim, Coleraine in Co Londonderry, and Craigavon in Co Armagh missing out.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up This year, the award is for the monarch’s Platinum milestone next year, and Ballymena is in the running for a third time, as well as Bangor.Those hoping to secure the title for their respective towns will, like Mr Dillon, be hoping for positive vibes this time round.Following the announcement  years ago, it was argued, somewhat cynically, that adding the word ‘city’ after Lisburn and Newry was simply an act of political expediency, with Lisburn pleasing unionists and Newry pleasing nationalists.Regardless, Mr Dillon insisted it was a good decision and extolled the benefits it has brought the area in the years since.“Some people will tell you that it has done a whole lot for Lisburn, and others will tell you that it’s done nothing. It’s as simple as that, but people who think it hasn’t [done anything] are not thinking people,” he said. “Cities have to start somewhere. [Modern] London started hundreds of years ago as a small town. It’s a multi-national city now. Lisburn is growing, and the problems we have are planning issues over the last while. We want to expand in dferent directions. Planning takes light years,it gets through at all.“I still think that getting city status was a good boost for Lisburn. It has allowed us to grow, despite all the dficulties. “People want to come and invest in us, simply because we are a city.”Has the award put paid to the perception some people have that Lisburn is merely a satellite of Belfast that will one day be subsumed by the capital The UUP alderman was adamant that would never happen.“In  years’ time, people will see what it has done for Lisburn. Lisburn is not a suburb of Belfast. Lisburn would never join up with Belfast. They are two very dferent places,” he stressed.“People can speculate, but it’s not going to happen. Lisburn is a very thriving place.”Former Newry and Armagh MLA Danny Kennedy was a councillor when he proposed the idea of Newry applying for city status.It was reported at the time that Sinn Fein opposed the move to become a city because of the award’s links with the Queen’s Golden Jubilee.Mr Kennedy remembers a more pragmatic response. “[While] it’s fair to say [the reaction] wasn’t exactly enthusiastic at the time, they had indicated that they wouldn’t object. It was initially a lukewarm reception from the SDLP but it became warmer,” he said, stressing that the combined unionist and SDLP support helped get the project off the ground.“What did help was the reaction and influence of the chamber of commerce. They [councillors] then quickly saw the benefits to the area.“People who were key influences in education and commerce, they in turn reached out to the wider community. “The application then took off and, crucially, avoided the political pitfall you would have thought would come with that.”In the wake of the announcement of city status, Sinn Fein’s Davy Hyland, at that point the council’s chairman, welcomed the decision, telling the BBC: “Royalism wouldn’t be a very strong aspect of le here. The main thing is the recognition that it is now a city.”The late Seamus Mallon, at that time the local SDLP MP, also praised the decision, saying it was a “great day” for the area that pointed towards a “bright future for the city of Newry”.“This is a great day for Newry and represents a strong recognition of the work which has taken place in the city in recent times,” Mr Mallon added.Jaded thinking, however, was a harder stumbling block to overcome, said Mr Kennedy.“Some people were cynical about that, saying that Newry was a town and would always be a town,” he explained.“People were cynical again when both Lisburn and Newry were awarded it, saying it was a political trade-off. People, to this day, still say that. I’ve no evidence for that.“There was genuine goodwill and they were able to assemble a group of businesspeople and sportspeople like [former Northern Ireland footballer] Pat Jennings to come on board. Figures who were recognised as leading in their fields.“It became the creature of the chamber, rather than the council. And that made it easier in some ways because it took the politics out of it.“If I got up every week and asked, ‘Any word from the Queen yet ’, that wasn’t going to work.”While he acknowledged that some people still do not see Newry as a city, he said the status had brought many benefits.“I think it’s worthwhile. You could stand on ceremony and say, ‘Now, hang on. They haven’t got two cathedrals, they haven’t got the population’,” he added.“It’s not on the level of New York and it’s not on the level of those great English cities like Liverpool and Manchester, but there is economic and cultural benefit to it.”A framed copy of the Queen’s certicate conferring the status hangs in Mr Kennedy’s home.“I’m proud of it. It’s not an exclusive achievement of myself, but I was happy to be involved,” he said.“Success has many fathers. I did propose it at council level, but I would concede that most of the spadework was done by the Newry chamber and others.”City status may be a thorny issue that falls along orange and green lines, but it can also reignite long-standing rivalries between towns. Ards and North Down Borough Council recently gave Bangor the green light to pursue city status, but it prompted consternation from councillors who represent other areas, including Newtownards.Alistair Cathcart, a DUP councillor for Bangor Central who proposed that the council support the application, insisted it was a “no-brainer”. “Why go for this now  Because the opportunity is now,” he said.“We simply don’t know when the next opportunity will arise. It’s been  years since the last opportunity. It could be another  or  years into the future for the next one.”Other representatives felt otherwise. Joe Boyle, an SDLP, councillor for the Ards Peninsula branded it “embarrassing,” while Angus Carson, a UUP councillor, denounced it as an April Fool’s joke, insisting Bangor was “going down the tubes”.DUP Alderman Stephen McIlveen, who represents Newtownards, insisted his issue with it went beyond the old rivalry between the two towns, saying it was more to do with what a city is in principle.“The process they have is that any town can apply for city status,” he said. “A lot of people will look at certain towns and think, ‘This does not fit my idea of what a city should be’.“The idea that you can have this process devalues what a city like Belfast or Londonderry might be. “A city should be an economic driver. The idea that somewhere like Ballymena, Bangor or the idea of Lisburn [as a city], a lot of people still cannot accept that because it doesn’t meet the perception of what a city is. Does that devalue what a city is ”Mr McIlveen stressed he would not support a similar proposal for his town. “I feel exactly the same way about Newtownards. I’m guessing thatyou spoke to a lot of people in Newtownards, they would feel the same way,” he explained.“The concern among the chamber in Newtownards is that Bangor,did get city status, it may adversely affect them. “While I’m a councillor for the whole borough, I am a representative for the whole Newtownards town and I have to advocate for them. “If they [Bangor] get it, great. It’s a tremendous honour to attain, but I’m not too sure that many people still consider [Bangor] worthy of being a city.”Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma agreed.  “I have lived in Bangor for over  years, I have raised my family in Bangor, I love living in Bangor, but I am from London, and Bangor is not a city,” she said.The idea of what defines a city is a concept that fascinates architect Mark Hackett, who operates a practice in Belfast and has written articles for Architectural Review magazine.He believes cities are made by citizens, rather than being made in top-down processes.“Just calling something a city doesn’t make it a city. It’s more emotional than that,” he said. “I’m talking about it more from an urban theory point of view. If you want to have a cohesive city, it needs to have a lot of things in it that people have a lot of pride in. “The ability for people to gather and express civic pride, or civic displeasure or dissent, is a very important thing. If you can’t do that, then it’s not a city or, indeed, a town.”What matters is not whether a place is a town or a city, he argued, but whether it is a “good town, a good city”, regardless of status: “It’s not about the aspiration of getting the title of city conferred from someone . It’s not important how other people decide what your status is. It’s how the residents are. Are they truly invested in their town or their city ”Alderman Audrey Wales MBE, who proposed Ballymena’s application at Mid and East Antrim council, believes the town meets the criteria and more.“Ballymena is a wonderful place. Our citizens are forward-thinking and hard-working, and it really does deserve to be a city,” she said.Itwins, it will be a case of third time lucky. As well as missing out in , Ballymena made an attempt in , when one UK town was to be granted city status to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.Although Ballymena was nominated on that occasion, it was later withdrawn.“Everyone is looking forward to it just as much as last time,” said Ms Wales.She also stressed there was no rivalry with nearby towns, with the application “fully supported by Larne and Carrickfergus”.As part of the process, applicants must demonstrate “distinct identity”, civic pride, heritage, history, tradition and association with royalty.Carrickfergus could have good reason to apply for city status, given its royal links. Along with its castle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Baron and Lady Carrickfergus titles were conferred on Prince William and his we Catherine by Her Majesty on their marriage in .While it was not nominated, Ms Wales believes the general feeling is thatBallymena were to be successful, it would have a positive effect on the wider area overall.It would also be somewhat poetic, given the town already welcomes visitors with a sign reading “Ballymena: the City of the Seven Towers” — a proclamation that reflects the spires that once defined its skyline.Ms Wales said: “We’re known as that, so it would be nice to get that status confirmed.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeNI voucher scheme: how to get more bang for your buckHow ‘Costa del North Coast’ no longer haven for working class as house rental hits £k for a week‘Kind, unassuming and effective’: Boris Johnson and Micheal Martin lead tributes to former NI SecretaryAntrim care home struggling with Covid outbreak amid workforce crisisTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated PlayVideo: The moment a Turkish F Jet misses a crowd of onlookers at Waddington AirshowLatest Northern IrelandWinter months could see ‘greatest pressures ever experienced’ by health serviceBallynahinch look to get back on track with disciplined displayDavid Healy relishing Windsor reunion with old ‘bubbly’ Preston pal Stuart King as Linfield take on CarrickPaddy McNair is ‘fully deserving’ captain on th Northern Ireland capAll-Ireland heroes step into the limelight again as Tyrone championship engages a higher gearLatestWinter months could see ‘greatest pressures ever experienced’ by health serviceHeads call on ministers to cancel Sats exams in  amid Covid- disruptionPackham leads children’s march to Buckingham Palace to ask royals to rewild landRowling to celebrate Harry Potter anniversary with champagne and cheese on toastManager Robert Page urges Wales to seize World Cup play-off place,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They were just personal tales and stories of going out drinking or doing this and that,” he added.“There’s so much love for him still that I just thought people would like to hear the things that I had been hearing but hadn’t been written down anywhere.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Throughout his career, Joey was never one to go out of his way to speak to the media, given his quiet nature, but the new book reveals more the man, rather than the racer.The Isle of Man TT held a special place in his heart. It was there that he had his greatest triumph when, at  years of age, he reclaimed the F crown for the first time in  years.During his early racing days, Joey drove the roads in the dark to learn every bump and curve of the track.Hector Neill, who owns the Synetiq BMW British Superbike team and played a big part in helping the icon land his first major sponsorship, got the fright of his le in a late-night lap of the Isle of Man course.“We were in the pub at the TT one night, drinking vodka — Joey liked vodka — and he says, ‘Hey, Heccie, you want to do a lap ’,” Neill writes in the book.“We were coming down to Barregarrow [a fearsomely fast and narrow downhill section with walls and a house at the apex] absolutely flat out, as fast as the car would go, and Joey switched the headlights off. I nearly fainted.“I says, ‘Joey, what the hell are you doing ’, and he told me that he wanted to show me that he knew the course so well he could drive it blindfolded. I would never do it again, I can tell you.”Always one to drive to some of the most far-flung races around Europe, Joey loved camping and spending time with his mates during the trips.Tony ‘Slick’ Bass, who worked as a mechanic for the rider in , recalled: “Joey and his gang were staying in a tent in Portugal, while the rest of us were in a five-star hotel.“A mole burrowed its way up into the middle of the tent during the night, and they absolutely flattened the tent trying to batter the mole with their shoes.“Joey couldn’t get any sleep, so he went to sleep in the van but ended up getting so badly bitten by mosquitoes that both his eyes were practically closed with the swelling. He could barely see, but he still won the race.”When he received his MBE in  for services to motorcycling, and an OBE  years later for his humanitarian work for children in Romanian orphanages, the usually long-haired and oil-stained Joey was impeccably dressed, along with his family, at Buckingham Palace. Prince Charles presented him with his MBE, but he later got the chance to meet the Queen at a Buckingham Palace reception.“I went to a garden party one time for all the world champions from Britain, and the Queen was there, but we were kept behind bars and we didn’t really get talking to her,” Joey said.“We were invited this time to a garden party, just a get-together, and the Queen came round and talked to us all. [She was] very, very nice and I had a glass of champagne with her. It was brilliant. Unbelievable.”Away from road racing, Joey’s mercy missions in eastern Europe showed the true nature of his character.After hearing of the brutal conditions orphans were forced to endure in the Romanian village of Ungureni, he visited shops, chemists and local businesses and filled his van with anything that might be able to help.Mechanic Sammy Graham said: “He piled the van up till you couldn’t put another sock in the van — it was full.”Joey travelled to Romania, Albania, Bosnia and Yugoslavia five times by himself, his van full to the brim with supplies, often in horrendous conditions.Covering the shenanigans of his racing days to the heartbreak of losing family members, friends and ultimately his own le to the sport he adored, Joey Dunlop: The Definitive Biography of The Greatest Road Racer is one not to be missed.As the world champion said himself, he never wanted to be a superstar, he just wanted to be himself — and he hoped people would remember him that way. This book certainly pays homage to that hope.Joey Dunlop: The Definitive Biography of The Greatest Road Racer, written by Stuart Baker, is out on Thursday.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeNI voucher scheme: how to get more bang for your buckHow ‘Costa del North Coast’ no longer haven for working class as house rental hits £k for a week‘Kind, unassuming and effective’: Boris Johnson and Micheal Martin lead tributes to former NI SecretaryAntrim care home struggling with Covid outbreak amid workforce crisisTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated PlayVideo: The moment a Turkish F Jet misses a crowd of onlookers at Waddington AirshowLatest Northern IrelandWinter months could see ‘greatest pressures ever experienced’ by health serviceBallynahinch look to get back on track with disciplined displayDavid Healy relishing Windsor reunion with old ‘bubbly’ Preston pal Stuart King as Linfield take on CarrickPaddy McNair is ‘fully deserving’ captain on th Northern Ireland capAll-Ireland heroes step into the limelight again as Tyrone championship engages a higher gearLatestHeads call on ministers to cancel Sats exams in  amid Covid- disruptionPackham leads children’s march to Buckingham Palace to ask royals to rewild landRowling to celebrate Harry Potter anniversary with champagne and cheese on toastManager Robert Page urges Wales to seize World Cup play-off placeBallynahinch look to get back on track with disciplined display,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

could see “the greatest pressures ever experienced by our health service”, Robin Swann has warned.Speaking at the Ulster Unionist Party conference in Belfast, the Health Minister said a likely upsurge in respiratory illnesses such as influenza, combined with the impact of Covid-, would present a “dferent” kind of challenge for the health service.He said hospitals are already seeing a spike in demand, and it is happening much sooner than usual.The weeks and months ahead will possibly yet again see the greatest pressures ever experienced by our health serviceRobin Swann, Health MinisterMr Swann said: “I am determined however to do absolutely everything we can to help our health service recover from the intense damage Covid has inflicted on it.“But the weeks and months ahead will possibly yet again see the greatest pressures ever experienced by our health service.“Winter has long been a challenging time for our health service, but winter this year will be dferent as it’ll be combined with ongoing high levels of Covid within the community, the usual colder weather and a likely upsurge in outbreaks of other respiratory viruses such as RSV and influenza.“These pressures will be keenly felt across our entire hospital, community and social care services.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our

health service have already experienced severe winter-like pressures over the summer months.”Mr Swann said the situation makes vaccination against Covid- more important than ever, and hit out at those peddling “misinformation and lies” which have led to vaccine-hesitancy.“Unfortunately whilst we have seen so many people work so hard on our vaccination effort, there have been a small minority, a tiny minority, that are determined to spread misinformation and lies.“Whilst I absolutely appreciate there are genuine cases of vaccine hesitancy, and I and my department will continue to have those engagements and provide whatever information or reassurance is necessary, unfortunately there others who choose not to accept the truth and seem set on putting the health and wellbeing of fellow citizens at risk.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fec .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_f-fab-ce-bf-ecf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fec .ece

sites, which will focus on non-Covid care.The sites, likely to be located at Musgrave Park Hospital in Belfast, the hospital and primary care complex in Omagh, and Ulster Hospital, will be designated elective surgery hubs “where planned surgery will continue safely and sustainably throughout the coming winter”, he said.Following a targeted workforce appeal aimed at retired staff and workers who have recently left the health service, , expressed an interest, while  submitted an application.Mr Swann also took aim at the Northern Ireland Protocol, raising concerns over the impact it could have on the flow of medicines into the region.“My officials are working around the clock to find practical solutions so that patients are not affected,” he said.“But let me be clear, no matter what the European Commission may think is acceptable or a pain worth inflicting, as minister I’ll not countenance for a single second patients in Northern Ireland going without the medication they need.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised for problems with the app for Scotland’s Covid vaccine certication scheme. The new measure requires people going to nightclubs, concerts, some football matches and other large events to prove they have received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.Wales is also bringing in a similar scheme, due to launch on Monday October .Sir Ed told the virtual conference: “Liberal Democrats have always been clear. Covid ID cards are unworkable, expensive and illiberal.”The Lib Dem leader insisted such schemes were “not a real solution” and would “place an unfair extra burden on local businesses who’ve been through so much already”.Liberal Democrats have adopted a “principled response” to them across the United Kingdom.🗣️ @EdwardJDavey: It’s only been us @libdems with clear principles across the UK, taking a clear and principled position that unites our party across England, #Scotlandand Wales.— Scottish Lib DemsOctober , And he contrasted this approach with those of the other parties, saying the Conservatives were “pressing ahead” with plans for vaccine passports in England while at the same time opposing them in Scotland and Wales.Meanwhile he said: “Labour aren’t sure where they stand in England, but they oppose them in Scotland, and are bringing them in in Wales, and they even required Covid ID cards for their own party conference in Brighton.”The Scottish Greens had “seemed to oppose them” until a co-operation agreement with the SNP took them into government at Holyrood, and then “the Greens voted for them”.Sir Ed insisted: “It’s only been us – the Liberal Democrats – with clear principles across the United Kingdom, taking a clear and principled position that unites our party across England, Scotland and Wales.”They’re not just incompetent. These Conservatives are cruel.Liberal democrat leader Sir Ed DaveyThe Liberal Democrat leader also used his speech to hit out at Boris Johnson’s “cruel” Conservatives after the UK Government reduced Universal Credit payments by £ a week, despite criticism from the other parties and anti-poverty campaigners.He accused the Tories of “slashing the incomes of millions of hard-pressed working families by £, a year with their cut to Universal Credit” at the same time when food bills and heating bills are rising.Sir Ed said: “They’re not just incompetent. These Conservatives are cruel.“And the contrast between their policies, their conference and ours, between our party that truly cares about people’s lives, and this Prime Minister who clearly doesn’t… the contrast could not be starker.”This, Sir Ed added, was a “reminder of why we have to win more votes and more seats at the next general election, and get Boris Johnson out of Downing Street and his Conservatives out of Government”.He also attacked the Labour administration in Wales and the SNP government in Scotland, saying both of them had “mismanaged the NHS so badly that they’ve had to call in the army to drive ambulances”.Sir Ed insisted: “Our country needs us too, because we need the Liberal Democrats to stand up and protect our precious union, our family of nations.“Our liberal values – of community and internationalism, of openness and tolerance – they are the antidote to the nationalists in Scotland, Wales and England who ide people and who threaten to tear our union apart.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Colm Cusack, a founding member of Destined and until recently the services Secretary and a member on its Board of Directors. He was also the Centre Manager when the group was based in Great James Street and was responsible for everything from a tea bag to toilet roll. googletag.cmd.push He has been described as the face of Destined for visitors calling to the centre who would often receive a complimentary cup of tea. Colm headed up the older peoples group and organised many activities such as visits to the Bowling Alley, the Millennium Forum and Playhouse, restaurants and bars throughout the city. He was involved every year in the preparations for the St Patricks Day and Halloween parades. Colm was also instrumental in setting up the Friendship Club and supported the older members to undertake training to learn how to use mobile phones, how to text and email, and how to access the internet to reduce their levels of isolation.  Colm Cusack celebrates his retirement clients and staff at Destined. PHOTOS: Tom Heaney, nwpresspics  The new North West Learning Disability Centre was named the Cusack Centre in recognition of all the work that Colm has contributed to the learning disability community in the city. Speaking at the presentation, Destineds Dermot O’Hara said: “Colm has been a mainstay of the group since it started. He was the first person you met in the morning and always had a joke or laugh to share with everyone. “He will be missed in the coming future but we want him to know that he will always be welcome to call into Destined. I want to wish him well for the future and hope that he has a healthy and good retirement.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

He was the first person you met in the morning and always had a joke or laugh to share with everyone. “He will be missed in the coming future but we want him to know that he will always be welcome to call into Destined. I want to wish him well for the future and hope that he has a healthy and good retirement.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The cross-border cycle path and walkway looked to have been halted in its tracks back in June when planning permission for the first phase of the project had been rejected. The Councils main concerns back then were fears of the potential impact that the greenway could have on future housing development in the Buncrana Road area of Derry. googletag.cmd.push However, the green light has now received approval and Cllr Duffy expressed her delight at the news. She said “This greenway route is part of the North West Greenway Network Scheme which collectively will deliver .km of shared pedestrian and cycle paths on a cross border basis. “We need to reduce our reliance on petrol and diesel vehicles and for people to be able to make the choice to use more sustainable forms of transport. Infrastructure like this needs to be in place. “This application should be viewed alongside a similar application that is being worked on by Donegal Council that will eventually bring the greenway from St Columbs College right through to Buncrana.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Leisure and Development Committee approved a date and location for the International Air Show event to be held in . googletag.cmd.push The event is set to take place on the weekend of September  and , with the flight path to be centred between the towns of Portstewart and Portrush. However, Sinn Feacutein raised concerns over an absence of budget projections on a report presented to the Committee, and during an ill-tempered spat among councillors, proposed a further report be brought. Cllr Leanne Peacock Ballymoney Sinn Feacutein councillor Leanne Peacock said the council had shown a dereliction of duty. “Weve got to this stage, agreeing specic details of this project, but were yet to have a single estimate provided to this council for what it will cost us,” she told the council. “As custodians of the public purse, its a complete dereliction of our duty to proceed without a single estimate of what this will cost our rate payers. “We have seen where such reckless decision-making has got us in the past. This council has spent thousands on consultancy fees a year before the event. “Its outrageous that members are not being provided with the most basic detail to make decisions the cost, which is usually the starting point.”     Cllr Peacock proposed a report be brought back to the Leisure and Development Committee with costings included, along with details of affordability checks carried out on the proposal. Council Mayor Richard Holmes pointed out a report with costings was already due to come back to the Committee, before opening the floor to speakers. Council officer Richard Baker said the event was still in the early stages of planning. “What weve done is set the foundation of the event the date and the location. There has been no discussion about the specics through the working group,” he said. “That will be developed and worked through the project board set up for the International Air Show in .” Cllr Aaron Callan has been central to the Air Shows planning. Limavady councillor Aaron Callan expressed his frustration with the Sinn Feacutein response to the event. “From day dot, Sinn Feacutein have opposed the air show in any form. Its not based on finances its based on ideological opposition to the fact that the RAF would be involved,” said the DUP councillor. “These events draw visitors into our area, that support the businesses that pay their rates, and the Air Show is a critical part of that going forward. “If Sinn Feacutein were so concerned about it, they would have appointed someone to the working group, which they refused to do.” Cllr James McCorkell Independent councillor for Limavady, James McCorkell, referred to a comment by Cllr Dermot Nicholl at last months committee about the event being linked to the Queens Platinum Jubilee. “At least Dermot at the meeting said she wasnt his Queen – fair enough. Call a spade a spade. I might not like it, but stop the nonsense, for goodness sake,” he said. “Just say you dont want it. Dont come up with excuses and nonsense about estimates. Weve held this air show for numerous years the estimates are already there,” added the former DUP representative.

Mr Colhoun, who lives at Somme Park near Altnagelvin, scooped the prize – awarded by Clanmil Housing Group – for his and the rest of his six-strong gardening teams work on the housing schemes garden. The annual Clanmil in Bloom competition highlights the hard work that goes into making the gardens at Clanmil housing schemes look pristine. googletag.cmd.push It recognises people who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can and gives green-fingered tenants a chance to showcase their handiwork. Mr Colhoun, a tenant at Somme Park, was presented with his award by Paul Fiddaman, Chair of Clanmil Housing, at a special celebration at The Clayton Hotel in Belfast. John is one of a team of six keen gardeners who tend the Somme Park site. He described accepting the award on their behalf as “a great privilege.” He said: “We love watching Monty Don on Gardener’s World and the Cha Flower Show to get tips and ideas – like planting strips of wildflowers instead of having all grass. Our fuchsia is doing very well this year.” As well as growing flowers at Somme Park, the gardeners have also created raised beds where they grow vegetables and have created pathways to make them wheelchair accessible for other tenants. John added: “We have peas, potatoes, gooseberries, red currants, courgettes and peppers.” “We even had a vine growing, but the wee birds and robins ate all the grapes.” John, who used to be a beekeeper, has always had an interest in gardening. He described how important getting out into the garden was to him during the lockdown.     He continued: “I find gardening very therapeutic, and it is a social thing too. The lockdown was a real hard time, and it was important to get to know your neighbours and check in with them to seethey were OK. “At Somme Park everyone looks out for each other, and we all have a bit of craic now in the common room.” Claire Darby, Senior Engagement Officer said, People who live in Clanmil homes love spending time in their gardens and many people across our schemes have spent a lot of time during lockdown in their outside spaces. “The Clanmil in Bloom awards event allows us to celebrate all their achievements and to recognise the great work they have done towards creating that special outdoor place.” Clare McCarty, Group Chief Executive at Clanmil, added: “Credit is due to all the participants, the judges and to Greentown Environmental – our grounds maintenance contractors – who helped sponsor the competition. “The pride and passion that Clanmil people have for their homes and neighbourhoods is clear to see. “Congratulations to everyone who took part, and especially to all the winners.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

When asked for a reason for his stance, Robinson said: “I wouldn’t force people to do it, it’s your choice and your body.” googletag.cmd.push Ireland manager Stephen Kenny has defended his decision to pick the striker to play in Saturdays game saying it would be extremely radical to punish players with international exclusion for refusing to be vaccinated. I think for inidual associations to just come together to decide not to select any player that hasn’t got it would create as many problems,” added Kenny. “They’re problems we don’t need to have.” Joe Duffy opened the conversation on his show Liveline today which seemed to snowball into an argument between pro and anti vaxxers, with some callers slamming Joe for bullying the  year old Robinson. Shocking stuff from @joeliveline beretating Callum Robinson for not taking a covid vaccine. The HSE clearly state the longterm effects information are limited. No one should be hounded in to taking any medication-especially a still on trial one! #liveline — Karen Luby October ,     While others felt that Robinson shouldnt be allowed to play in Saturdays game. If you are not vaccinated you shouldn’t be playing for Ireland, unless you have proper medical reasons. #liveline — Cllr Declan Meenagh ️♿ #StayHomeSaveLives October ,     Commenters on Twitter were also quick to point out that since Callum Robinson has had Covid twice, he would surely have stronger immunity towards the virus. Joe is a dummy .. imagine covering this topic and not knowing that the player is recovered from covid and has more protection now than somebody vaccinated . Luke O Neill should be interviewed on the show to shut up those who don’t follow the science of natural immunity #Liveline          — samryan October ,     The FAI has since released the following statement: The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that all players and staff are tested for COVID- before reporting for international duty with Republic of Ireland teams and are tested repeatedly in camp in line with FAI and UEFA protocols. We have encouraged all our players at all levels of the game to be vaccinated but we respect and must accept the right of all iniduals to make a personal choice on COVID- vaccination. The Association will continue to exercise the highest standards for the safety of all our stakeholders. Our COVID- testing protocols for all players and staff on international duty strictly follow UEFA protocolsand are compliant with all Irish Government guidelines. The FAI reconfirms our support for all Government, UEFA and FIFA protocols during the COVID- pandemic. We thank all our stakeholders for their ongoing exemplary compliance with Government guidelines over the last  months.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Bank of Ireland branch at Strand Road is to close its doors today..Derry NewsA sad day - Bank of Ireland Strand Road branch in Derry to close their doors today for the last time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security. A home also affords personal dignity, a space for privacy and a foundation for family le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Best wishes to Knockevin staff  ","story":"SLIEVE Croob councillors Cathy Mason and Roiacutesiacuten Howell paid a recent visit to the new Knockevin senior school in Castlewellan.Located on the site of the former Castlewellan Primary School in the town, the councillors welcomed staff and students and hope that they will be very happy and will be warmly welcomed by the wider community.Cllr Howell said the global pandemic had ldquosignicantly disrupted the education of the special school pupils and impacted on their learning, communication and mental health.She extended best wishes to school principal Sarah Liddell and senior department leader Gillian Rea.ldquoWhilst the children have been on the premises from September, there are still issues that I and Cllr Mason will be working closely with the school, the Education Authority and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ensure that staff and pupils have the best all round experience on their newly refurbished site, added Cllr Howell.Cllr Mason said Knockevin caters for pupils with severe and profound learning dficulties aged between  and  and aims to provide a supportive educational environment where they feel secure, at their ease and thrive both educationally, socially and spiritually.She said the main school is located in Downpatrick, with an Early Years Centre in Dundrum.ldquoNow we have the senior school in Castlewellan which will seek to help pupils achieve their maximum level of independence in preparation for le when their education finishes, said Cllr Mason.She added: ldquoHaving visited the Downpatrick site in recent months I have seen first hand how happy and content the children are in school..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_bid.jpg","title":"Bid to save St Mary’s school from closure  ","story":"GOVERNORS and staff have pledged to try and save a primary school in Saintfield from closure.St Maryrsquos Primary School is earmarked to close by August  next year due to low pupil numbers.The Education Authority last week published the closure proposal seeking any objections or support to be lodged by November .The proposal was made by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the schoolrsquos trustees.It states enrolment to the  year-old school on the Old Grand Jury Road has dwindled to  pupils for this academic year, with the majority in the Primary  and  classes.The proposal claims there is currently only one pupil in the schoolrsquos Primary ,  and  classes, two pupils in Primary  and no pupils in Primary .A spokesperson for CCMS said: ldquoCCMS has carried out initial consultation on the closure of St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield, which is a Down and Connor diocesan school. Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges. CCMS believes that the proposal to discontinue provision at St Maryrsquos PS would not impact signicantly on other schools.It lists other Catholic primary schools in the area mdash St Caolanrsquos in Darragh Cross, St Josephrsquos in Crossgar, and St Patrickrsquos in Ballynahinch mdash as being between less than four to seven miles away from St Maryrsquos and which could take its pupils.The proposal also said closure plans had been put back for a year due to the Covid- pandemic.The SDLP councillor for the area, Cllr Terry Andrews, said he shared the concerns of parents and staff.ldquoSt Maryrsquos has provided first-class education to the community for many, many years and the staff are to be commended for their dedication to generations of families who have sent their children there, he said.ldquoI would encourage all local people to take part in the consultation to the EA and make them aware of their strong feelings to the proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Business owners urged to engage over town future  ","story":"THE Downpatrick business community has been urged to play a full part in the consultation exercise on the continued economic regeneration of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is spearheading the initiative and local councillor Dermot Curran appealing to businesses to get involved.While a number of politicians are in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, local authority officials are not keen. However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others. I hope that this vision can be realised..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_conor.jpg","title":"Conor shines in final  ","story":"DROMARA travelled to Ballykinlar to take on a fancied Drumaness side in the county U- Football Shield final last Sunday evening.The game started well for Drumaness with two quick points on the board from Niall Flanagan and Ben Cassidy in the first few minutes, but soon Dromara were awarded a penalty after Thomas McKey was fouled in the box.Thomas took the penalty himself, but it was well saved by lsquokeeper Reece Rogan.Dromara did get on the scoresheet after a foul on Odhraacuten McCann was converted by Jon Rodgers.Both defences dictated play over the next period with Dromararsquos Elliot Harris, Sam Warwick and James Furphy keeping the mobile Drumaness forwards at bay.Dromararsquos fortunes took a hit when forward Odhraacuten McCann suffered a nasty shoulder injury and had to be replaced.Just before the water-break, Drumaness rattled off two excellent long range scores from Conor Armstrong with Dromara replying with an equally great score from Joe McAllister.Dromara were finding the physicality of the Drumaness full back line of Leo Madine, Ben Miskelly and Philip Gladysz dficult to penetrate.Drumaness finished the quarter with a point from Conor Murphy leaving them ahead by three points.The second quarter started off with another cracking point from Conor Armstrong and within minutes Drumaness took control of the game.Shea Quinn got on the end of a long ball and bagged a goal and a minute later Conor Armstrong hit a second goal.Dromara rallied with good points from Thomas McKey and Jon Rodgers but once again Drumaness replied with a point from a free from Conor Murphy and two further points from the unstoppable Conor Armstrong.Drumaness half backs Jaiden Murdock and Conn OrsquoHagan were delivering quality balls to their forwards and Dromararsquos half backs Aidan OrsquoHare and Ryan Gates had to work very hard to stem the relentless attacks.Young Lorcan McNeill scored a great inidual goal to offer Dromara some hope, but, as ever, the Blues hit straight back with scores from Jake Madine and another from Conor Armstrong.The half ended with a fine point for Dromara from the energetic Joe McAllister to leave Drumaness leading by nine points. Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks. Congratulations to the Drumaness team and their mentors on a great display and a deserved victory.Dromara -Drumaness -U- Shield Final.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_cormac.jpg","title":"Cormac enjoy his first days at Harvard University  ","story":"CORMAC Savage was only  when he got his first experience of the hallowed halls of Hard University.Standing in the same place where former president John F Kennedy once walked was enough to confirm to the young teenager that this is where he had to be one day.Just four years later, the Downpatrick man has fulfilled his dream and is studying at the world-renowned Ivy League university in the US.The former head boy of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School has jumped right in and immersed himself into his classes and every extra-curricular activity and group he can possibly join.He has been in the city of Cambridge, on the fringe of Boston, since late August.Despite getting four A* grades in his A-Levels and having achieved considerable praise for his roles in school politics and as a Youth Parliament Member for South Down, he said he was overwhelmed to have been accepted into Hard late last year.ldquoEvery single day I think Irsquom so lucky to be here.

I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago. I wrote a letter at  and saidI would like to meet himhe was ever in Ireland. My parents and I got the chance to meet him in Dublin the day after the Brexit vote.ldquoIrsquom more likely to ask him nowhersquos going over to Ireland, would he give me a lt on Air Force One, he joked.Cormac is still not behind the door connecting with famous people with his red hair helping him engage with TV host and producer mdash and fellow redhead mdash Conan OrsquoBrien when the former Hard student gave an address to new students.ldquoThe rest of the guys suggested we get a picture together as we look alike but he was great fun. The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans. But what I have realised here is that I really love the place that Irsquom from and so proud of it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_covid.jpg","title":"Covid","story":"THE continued operation of a coronavirus test centre in Downpatrick could be compromisedvandal attacks in the area do not end, a local politician fears.The centre run by the Public Health Agency at Dunleath Park plays a pivotal role in testing people who suspect that they may have contracted the disease.Concern about the impact of vandalism on the centre comes after it was revealed that a number of iron bars were reportedly thrown towards it by young people who are also being blamed on ongoing anti-social behaviour at this part of the town.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor said the test centre and the Dunleath Park area had attracted what he described as a ldquospate of anti-social behavioural elements which was affecting its operation.He declared: ldquoThere is absolutely no excuse for our public service staff having to feel at risk as they go about their work protecting us and our loved ones.ldquoThere is a danger to test centre staff and their equipment on site at Dunleath Park and the overall operational ability of the centrethis behaviour continues.Cllr Trainor said he raised the ldquoserious matter with police and also appealed to Newry, Mourne and Down Council to direct its community safety wardens to the area in the evenings.ldquoWe also need a greater police presence at Dunleath Park as well and I welcome confirmation that this will happen, he continued.ldquoThose engaging in this behaviour can put it behind them and can seek something better. The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions. The testing centre in particular is a key asset in the ongoing fight against coronavirus.ldquoThe excellent frontline staff who work there deserve to be allowed to get on with the job free from threats of any kind.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm. After leading out the EDAC team at the Road Relay Champs in style, he ed to Victoria Park in Belfast for the weekly parkrun.These events are not races but timed runs open to anyone who registers. Neil was taking part as a training exercise in his group coached by Mark Kirk.He lead the pack in with a super slick . for the k which was reported later as being the third quickest parkrun time recorded at any of the weekend parkruns throughout the UK.We donrsquot normally report on parkrun as it is impossible to keep on top of all the activity, but this one is worth a mention. Well done for putting EDAC on the map.We are always open to new senior members and have acquired quite a few recently who are glad that they have taken the plunge.We are an all rounder club with members chasing speed, distance and the challenges but we also have a main body who come to training to keep fit and enjoy the good company.If you are interested, please email Donal at membership@eastdownac for details..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie.jpg","title":"Francie builds boat with recycled material  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man is realising his dream of building a river boat by using recycled materials such as wood pallets and aluminium.Instead of costing around pound, for a new boat of the same size and specication, Francie Morgan aims to finish his ft boat on a budget of pound,.The  year-old intends to launch the four-berth boat from Carrybridge in Upper Lough Erne in Co Fermanagh next May, with the help and support of his family and many friends.But before that, he would love to enter it as a float in next yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.While the main structure is complete, Francie will be working over the winter and spring to fit out the inside.The father-of-seven began to build the boat last year during lockdown and scoured scrape-yards and recycled materials yards to get items which either cost him a fraction of their original price or where the owners were only too happy to get rid of them.ldquoTherersquos men who are only too happy to see me coming to take away some pallets. It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

mdash A major new drive has been launched to attract private investment in a planned multi-million pound facelt for Newcastle.Down Council is targeting a host of major private firms in a bid to interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what le is like in a community with nothing.From a world that is void of any luxuries and running short on basic necessities, African visitors from Malawi, brought their gt of song to St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar.Nine representatives from a primary school, a hospital and a church of the Embangweni Station sang Malawian songs and shared stories about their home with the pupils.With the aim of the visit to share cultures the visitors were offered Irish stew and watched the pupils perform Irish dancing.The school children were amazed to hear how their guests had never been on a plane, boat or train before and how they only earn around pound a year.School principal, Mr Harry Murray, said he was delighted to have the visitors at the school so his students could hear for themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will signicantly raise the profile of Killyleagh as a tourist destination and add support to existing town facilities such as shops, entertainment, recreational facilities, schools and churches.SAINTFIELD mdash Dozens of brides arrived at Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church Hall on Thursday evening for a girlsrsquo night out.There was a distinct absence of grooms as women and girls filled the hall for a wedding dress fashion show to raise money for the cancer research.Tables were decorated and guests were seated, as  models went backstage to get ready for a show.As the brides made their way along the catwalk, wedding tales recalling generations of local brides emerged.The compere told the story of one local woman who had left her husband waiting at the altar for half-an-hour because her cat was having kittens, while other young women, modelling their mothersrsquo and grandmothersrsquo dresses, told their own family tales.DERRYBOYE mdash Managing a successful PR consultancy and travelling to the far side of the world to adopt her ldquolittle angel, has helped to make a Derryboye womanrsquos le complete.Rosemary Hamilton seems to thrive off her busy lestyle and the fact she and her husband, Terry Graham, adopted a baby girl from China three years ago.Rosemary, who is the co-founder and now chairman of Holywood-based Future Image PR consultancy firm, and her husband were one of the first families from Northern Ireland to adopt a child from China.As Rosemary explained, she has had a long love affair with China and its people, ever since she heard a woman recite the Lordrsquos Prayer in Chinese when she was at Sunday School.Her fondness of the country continued into her adult years, she travelled quite a bit throughout China and Asia, and when she and Terry married they automatically thought of adopting a child from the country..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_mands.jpg","title":"M%26S hotly tipped to open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

A number of children have to cross the road on their way to school and it is essential that it is safe to do so, he continued.ldquoA pelican crossing can help achieve that and I hope that the roads minister will look favourably upon my request. This is a critically important issue that must be addressed.Cllr Curran said it is his understanding that the recent incident involving a child at the Downpatrick Road ldquocould have been quite serious and hopes that action will be taken to prevent any kind of repeat.He said pupils who attend the busy primary range in age from  to  and in addition to his request to Mrs Mallon, he would be keen to meet meet with roads officials on site.ldquoIt is a very serious situation when drivers are not obeying the speed limit, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoA new pelican crossing would require drivers to come to a complete stop to allow children to cross safely..Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe recent incident involving a child has reinforced the need for a dedicated road crossing and I hope that the Department for Infrastructure will respond positively to my request.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8803916.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularPM Boris Johnson leads tributes to former NI Secretary James Brokenshire following his deathPSNI officer investigated for  years ... on word of Mount Vernon UVF killer Gary Haggarty‘Unionism is led by gutless careerist amateurs: time for a clear out’Royal Military Police officer has recalled taking a rle from accused veteran Dennis Hutchings, but cannot confirm the weapon was his, a judge has heardJudith Gillespie says sexual assaults by male officers ‘not uncommon when I joined up’ in wake of Sarah Everard murder by Wayne CouzensMost Popular‘Boris has basically admitted it: the Scotland   Northern Ireland bridge is dead’Irish pupil numbers being in freefall is a sign a language act is not neededTim McGarry: The ‘Brexiteers against Brexit’ lot are angry – here are my proposals‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’ DUP abandoning bedrock principles in order to chase fickle popularity                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They seem to have abandoned principles that were once the bedrock of the party, and have no conscience about it.More worrying, their members have bought into it.They are courting popularity, and in a world that has become increasingly secular this will earn its nod of approval, but that comes at a price!If you sell your soul, the devil always collects.Public opinion can be fickle!No doubt in the run up to the election they will resort to the old vote catcher: “vote to keep the other side out”.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Councillor Sam Nicholson.Businesses providing separatetoilets for male, female, disabled and baby changing receivea higher fee than those offering just one unisex toilet.The matter was originally tentativelydiscussed by the environmental services committee in November and December  before ing to the agenda in August  with an updated report on the matter presented to members of the committee on Tuesday, October .The community toilet scheme was initially considered as a way to deal with any potential shortfall in public toilet facilities in Portadown, however, the report notes the toilet facilities in Portadown ’s building on William Street are now operational and are under contract until April .With regards to a pilot for the scheme, the report suggests Lurgan and Portadown as two suitable areas.At present,Lurgan has four free to use facilities along with  pubs and caféswhile Portadown has eight free to use facilities along with  pubs and cafés.Members were also made aware that Derry City and Strabane Council launched its own Community Toilet Scheme in April  and have  participating businesses.Councillor Sam Nicholson asked businesses had previously expressed interest in the scheme but was advised businesses had never really been approached about the scheme by Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience.“It had been brought to committee on a number of occasions to seewe wanted to go to businesses,” said Mr Patience.“The only thing we have done is identy those locations so there is some detail for Portadown and Lurgan as possible sites for a trial.“We have not approached businesses yet. “Members had previously said they would be happy to hear more information about the scheme so this is us bringing that further information back.”Councillor Nicholson said it would be worth “asking the question” to businesses and proposed a workshop to discuss the potential objectives, scope and outcomes of any potential scheme.His proposal was seconded by Alderman Stephen Moutray who said it would be worth “exploring the merit” of this proposal.“This is potentially an opportunity to provide more facilities for people in our town centreswe go ahead with this,” he said.“As long as we are sure this has not already been discussed with businesses then I am happy to second the proposal that this is explored further in a workshop.”Read this:- Halloween back with a bangEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
